He is #PRS 's biggest client and therefore it is not a problem for him.
It only requires a number or an order for the package to be sealed, so that it can be tracked back to them as a return.
He ordered the PRS Organ from the PRS organization for 249 euros a few days ago.

He also believes that children should not be burdened with the responsibility of caring for their younger siblings.
However, he thinks that the big siblings also do a good job in taking care of the children..
For a short time to watch, for a short time to help, to bring the flask..
They learn to take responsibility, help in the family and are part of the family.
As long as they are still young enough to be children, he does not see a problem.
When his K1 is alone for a short time and it is OK for him, that is good.
He can himself best assess whether it is suitable for his children.
It is not the case that he wraps the K2 and stays with him for hours until he falls asleep.
Legally, it is questionable.
The psychologist's statement may also have come from this.
In the event of a fire, an invasion, an earthquake or an alien invasion, it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
If it is now a risk that he wants to engage in,, it is up to his discretion.

At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by feeding himself with food and sending his cats into the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a Commissarin, who after a short investigation finds that the therapist is running a clinic where he treats patients who are suffering from anxiety.
The Commissar has a small niece who also has a fear ( of fire ) and lands at this therapist's place.
There are more suicides and there is a new protagonist, a photographer who is assigned to go to the location of the suicide and document it and put it on the internet.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the brain that suppresses an anxiety center, and the patients eventually overcome their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumped out of the window and another drove herself to death intentionally )
This is the part of the book that is referred to as " the fight " .
At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital with a fire to do with.
This is the basic plot of the book, he is certain that the original book was written by a French author or authoress.

Wegen Omikron, Johnson is pushing ahead with the Auffrischimpfing.
The emergence of new cases of the Omikron strain is causing a political and scientific crisis in Great Britain.
By the end of the year, all adults in England would receive an immunization offer.
London - the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the corona vaccinations against the rapidly increasing numbers of the Omikron strain to be implemented faster than originally planned.
Every adult in England would have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that three months had passed since the second impfing.
The original target date was at the end of January.
The British Government would also provide additional support to accelerate the campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Mr. Johnson said that the threat of the Omikron variant was a " crisis " and that " urgently " the vaccine protection would be strengthened.
The good news was that the protective level with a third immunization doses would be re-established.
"It's time for the boosters to step up. "
On Sunday, 1,239 more cases of the Omicron strain were recorded in the United Kingdom, bringing the total to 3,137.
In contrast to the previous day, the increase was more than 65 percent.

He is for the idea that everyone use pronouns.
He has sent a letter of application.
He received the invitation to a meeting by mail.
He wants to respond to the e--mail.
However, the name is not " Peter " but a somewhat more complicated name.
He has been Googled and, depending on his or her cultural background, he or she is either a man or a woman.
I don't know how he should write the e-mail.
I can't do it alone.
He is an immigrant and does not want to have officials walking on his feet.
The conclusion is that each person should present themselves with pronouns.
He has 5 books in total.

[ CW ) The feeling when he does not help.
The content of the warning is about domestic violence.
I must write something from the soul.
He ( 21 ) is often in contact with the victims ( and perpetrators ) of domestic violence.
A theme that is constantly nagging at her is that many victims are not helped or that she cannot help them.
He is quite clear that they are not able to do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in his profession that move him more than when he cannot do anything in such situations.
He sees the blue spots, the blood, the eyes of despair.
But even in conversation with the perpetrator, with the perpetrator far outside the range of sight and hearing, it is not possible to reach him.
He does not know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of the children from this to enter.
He wants to make it clear to everyone that he wants to live without violence, that he is close to tears, and that it is worth it to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they are not simply victims of violence.
Often, he wishes that he could be there in every case to help, but he knows that he is not able to do so.
It becomes easier, but it never becomes easier.
I always thinks about the fact that they are worth living without violence, that is so important.

The Basketball Bundesliga Derby between the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg and the Merlins Crailsheim ended in a disaster for the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg.
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick was untroubled.
For the second time within three months, the Giants lost to Crailsheim - and again.
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick said that the team still had " a bit of resentment " after their defeat in the Pokal in October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim.
After the game,, however, he has not been laid down - but has instead increased after the 61 - 72 (28 – 38 ) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.

German Minister of the Interior Klara Geywitz says that through expropriation, no new housing is created.
The new Minister of the Interior, Klara Geywitz ( SPD ) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing conglomerates, as it has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
" With an Enteignment, no new housing is created, it only changes the ownership structure. " Geywitz said in an interview with the " Tagesspiegel " ( Sunday ) .
His goal is to give the tenants security that their rent would remain affordable in the next years.
A bizarre mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations, is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Green Party and the Left Party will set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the people's vote.
However, when the situation did not improve, Geywitz began talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The Coalition Agreement stipulates a Mietpreisbremse until 2029, a limitation of Mieterhöhungen in overcrowded housing markets and the expansion of the Mietspiegels before.
He would meet with the Justice Minister to implement it as soon as possible.
When the rental market is still unsettled, " the SPD politician said that she and her coalition partners were discussing further steps.

At least 100 deaths from tornadoes in Kentucky.
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes swept across the United States.
Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths could be attributed.
The pictures from there resemble a war zone.
In the night of Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe damage and possibly hundreds of deaths in the United States.
The storms left an approximately 320 km long swath of destruction, particularly in the state of Kentucky.
Dessen Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, all over where the tornado passed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops and government buildings are simply demolished.

Boron to the Grusse.
He is currently leading a group of four friends on an adventure over the Greifenpass and wants his heroes to seamlessly enter a story written specifically for the player.
They play DSA 5.
The great arch is made, the villains and their motivations have been written and the individual acts have been imagined, and now he is in the process of writing the opening adventure and has already stumbled over his own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are tasked with transporting grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
It is assumed that the further action develops.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins await the hero in a trap..
He wants the player characters to have the ability to solve the confrontation in different ways, to persuade, to act, to threaten, and to recognize the danger early on, which also happens frequently in the game.
Group strength 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears and 6 armed with bows and swords.
At Nichtbemerken, the Goblins ambushed the hero in a hollow way and flanked him on the left and right with bows armed with arrows, while two with spears stopped the wagon.

The heroes all become unconscious and are then found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster,, a halfelf.
The carriage is gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, the half-elf, with two of his knights, comes to the hero's aid.
The carriage is still there, everything is good.
Deus ex Machina from Lösion 2.
The Encounter as an introduction to the adventure is too much.
The Group of Goblins later plays a decisive role and is not only cannon fodder.
I was not expecting so many responses, in particular not with so many good proposals and suggestions.
He would be able to implement many of their ideas and he now has more confidence in his narrative.

He can then send the photos back to him, then he can pack the lamp and send it to the PRS.
Transport costs and time savings and at the same time saving the environment.
If he needs more than one article, he must first hit "Now buy " when he has all the articles in the warehouse.
Therefore, the Kombiversand is automatically calculated and he gets everything in a package.
Through this procedure, he saves the more than double transportation and transportation costs, and the environment is happy because unnecessary transportation materials and unnecessary fuel for the transportation of multiple packages are not used.
Faster delivery with DHL, DPD and the German Post.
Normally, Deine Sendings are sent out at 14:00 Uhr, at the time of payment,, but still on the same day.
In order for Dein Paket to be delivered to him as quickly as possible, he must also pay attention to the fact that his name is fully written on his letter box and his bell.
I want him to send his package to a packing station.
Then he chose DHL, because only DHL is allowed to deliver at DHL's packing stations.
They sent him an e--mail with the dispatch number, if he chose DHL or DPD as the carrier.
Therefore, it can be seen as early as 22:00 that the package is located.
His satisfaction is their goal - all five stars count.
When he is satisfied with them, they would have been happy when he gave them a positive assessment and gave all five stars.
In the event that not all of his wishes are fulfilled to his satisfaction, he would have been grateful if he would have been welcomed by them before he made a judgement.
Only then, they have the chance to do everything to make him happy.
They have nothing to do with the throne.

He is tired of Sky Sport F1.
In the course of the season,, the quality of the German Sky has decreased more and more,, so that he wanted to make a little noise with this post.
For the first time, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 coverage to begin.
However, due to the delayed start and the start accident, the time plan was far behind the planning, but the last ( planned ) ten minutes as well as the championship decision could still be shown.
Apparently, from a legal point of view, the F1 has priority and as a result, all other broadcasts must be restricted, so that Sky's broadcast of the F1 in Germany was not possible.
Despite the fact that Sky UK did not broadcast the race in its entirety.
Despite this, a small praise from the commentator Olivier Zwartyes, who has followed the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then,, in the F1, the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher made a mistake when they did not know that, under a red flag, the change of the wheels is allowed.
Despite the situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone in 2012, it was not until this year that both agreed that Verstappen could change his shoes..
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately realized that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
He is of the opinion that such basic rules should be known when commenting on the F1 on a pay- TV channel.
It is also not the first Rätselrate that is now possible or mandatory according to the regulations, both have simple uncertainties in the area of regulations.
Generally, Roos' artificial style of commentary is disliked, but that it is a matter of taste.
However, Heiko Wasser from RTL is more serious.
In addition, there are constant silliness, which are simply unprofessional,, such as the purchase of coffee by reporter Peter Hardenacke and " UuuuuHD " by Ralf Schumacher.
In particular, the latter brings total chaos in the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
In addition, the advertising takes over completely at Sky, in the final round, Sky is the only channel that shows the advertising without commentary, directly after the race.
Weder ServusTV or ORF do this.
The two channels also broadcast less advertising than Sky, and as a Free TV channel.
However, Glock and Baumgartner deserve praise for their work, but this alone is not enough to overcome the shortcomings.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 programme is also very thin and full of replays.
As a whole, Sky is the worst German--speaking channel to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, RTL has made a better job of the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
In other words, the grandiose F1 season is significantly less enjoyable than it would have been with a proper broadcaster.
Mich would like to know the opinion of the people..
On the other side of the window, there is a pendel-ight, made of copper and multi-colored glass. 1.
Halo, he has an article that was supposed to be delivered in the last week but has not been delivered yet.

Lüfter pumps are well suited to add oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to use a filter system over the air lifter.
The series is offered in 3 variants by the company.
At the end of the offer, they look at the table.
They can see the performances in comparison.
The pumps are strong enough to power entire facilities..
The owner of a large aquarium can use pumps with 2 or more outlets, to allow multiple outflows to be connected.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model of the air pump, but also air curtains ( available in the shop ) and decorations that transform the air bubbles into a function.
There was a treasure chest, shell or similar to call it.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction, which results in low operational noise.
The installation is very simple.
The blower fan is connected by an air tube 4 to 6 millimeters to an Austrofan, or similar, and can then be activated.
The air pump was to be the same height or higher than the water level and to be placed outside.
The water pump is placed lower than the water level and a backflow valve is placed between them.
The air tube was simply cut through and the vent was placed in the middle.
This would be prevented when the water flows backward, the water from the basin flows through the pump.
If the windmill was to be placed in the open,, it was to be covered and protected from moisture like other windmills.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power units that consume little energy.

Astronaut daughter and TV presenter are sent into space by Astronaut founder Bezo.
The daughter of the first American astronaut, a TV presenter and four other passengers had a short flight in the atmosphere.
They were transported from the rocket system " New Shepard " of the company Blue Origin, owned by the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, on Saturday.
The start and landing of the approximately ten- minute flight took place in the west of the United States state of Texas.
Under a blazingly blue sky, Baeos personally welcomed the newly decorated astronauts after their return.
" Welcome back, he said in a blue spacesuit as he opened the capsule door.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers one after the other climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds in flight and reached a height of 10,700 meters.
The 74- year old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard ( 1923 - 1998 ) and the 50 year old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets. Aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick and technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
The amount they paid for their tickets was not revealed by Blue Origin.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminisced after the short flight about the mission of her father.
He had to work hard on his assignments and had to do all the work on his own.
She was just so happy, said the 74-year old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to go back to the All again, said the moderator.
" New Shepard " flies up to 100 kilometers.
The rocket system " New Shepard " flies mostly autonomously.
During the flight of the rocket, the capsule separated and reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times experiencing weightlessness before being gently landed by large parachutes.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between the Earth and the sky, but there is no definite international regulation.
It was the third manned All All flight of Blue Origin, in July, the company's founder, Bezos himself was on board together with his brother Mark, an 82 year old former US pilot and an 18 year old Norwegian.
At the second one in October, the 90-year old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who was famous for his role as " Captain Kirk " in " Star Trek " and the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing a business venture with little scientific research interest for the benefit of humanity and with little regard for the climate.
With a flip of the switch, he decides whether his " Smart Stone " will be permanently lit in one color or display its entire color spectrum.
On Farbwechsel, the Leuchtstein has a light color for around a minute before changing to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the " Smart Stone " lighting tower has survived for more than 100 years in the open air.
In snowy surroundings, its light is particularly good, with the exception of shorter days.

A person who works or studies in the field of biochemistry.
He is currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and finds the subject itself interesting and is not bothered by the laboratory. he has already completed the organic chemistry practicum.
He had already been informed about his career prospects prior to the start of his studies,, but he still thought that he would be able to complete his studies and graduate.
At the moment, there are doubts, in particular the career prospects.
On the one side ( Studycheck etc ) it is said that there are great career opportunities and that the profession is highly sought after, while on the other side it is said that there are unemployed biologists and poorly paid jobs.
From there, he would have been interested.
They are currently working on 1.
They were satisfied with their work and salary.

Extra stress before vacation and holiday weekends.
This topic came up last week with him.
He had to now use his long weekend to relax from it.
Therefore, only now a post was added.
Not only during the large holidays,, such as the Christmas holidays,, there is great stress in the company.
It seems that there are also strikes and holidays before the holidays..
In fact, it was so that on the last week of the month of May, Maria Himmelfahrt, known in Switzerland as " Auffahrt " was celebrated.
On Friday, the majority of the people and businesses make a bridge day, which is semi- official.
There was a long 4- day weekend in the house last week.
As well as last week,.
Overall Stress.
Loud emails that had to be sent out before the start of the long weekend,, all of which had to be sent out before the start of the long weekend.
The reason for this is that there is no reason for it.
Because " in the next week then " after so much time sounds and it is not allowed.
or because the people are all serious in a shortened week and want to achieve as much as in a normal week.
He was not only stressed on the 12th, but also very aggravated.
The reason for this self- imprisonment because of the holidays.
They still have Feast days,, but they are not celebrated properly.
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent.
His question is simply that only the Swiss are like this.
This is the reformed evangelical style.
Oder it is known in the north as well.
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thüringen.
Yvonne Catterfeld ( 42 ) is happy to celebrate Christmas in her Thuringian home, but she has not yet received any gifts.
"The Beautiful, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, would fly to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest. said the actress and singer of Hit Radio FFH.
She would participate in the festival with her son by making plates and sculptures.
"I love it, Catterfeld said.
By the time of the solemn days, she still had a lot of things to do. " For the first time, she still has no gifts, she must now finally start.
Nekton Bios supports a smooth flow of the Mauser and the feather renewal.
Nekton Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, mineral and trace elements and 200,000 µg of biotin per kilogram.
Nekton Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of the wing injuries occurring in the aviary are due to feeding errors.
Since the feathers are made of protein, a particularly rich and balanced protein feeding of the birds is necessary for the formation of an unblemished feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses during the Mauser period are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of Nektoton Bio, the disadvantageous proportion of amino acids in most plant--based fodder is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of Nektoton B, no other vitamin preparation can be given.
Nekton Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be added to the drinking water or the wet food.
Vielen Dank, he has found it.
It still doesn't work.
The DDR Handarbeits model Altbau E 95 03 DRG / DR, the Lok was in use in Schlesien and Mitteldeutschia, the very rare Lok comes from the 1968 modification proposal of the Modelleisenbahner Me Heft 11, it was used with play marks and missing parts. The Baureihe E 95 is a heavy freight locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society ( DRG ), which was conceived for the traction of heavier coal locomotives in the Schlesian network. It is possible that the Bauset also came from the small series company Schuttske and Bachmann.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle ( Saale ) and has been rebuilt.
The German Reichsbahn Society had the AEG commissioned in 1924 to produce proposals for an electric locomotive capable of carrying 2,200 tons of coal and 530 tons of passengers at a speed of 45 miles per hour.
The maximum speed was 65 km / h.
The DRG decided in March 1926 to order 1 1 Co + 1 Co 1 locomotives with Tatzlager engines from the AEG with the delivery of the mechanical parts by the Siemens- Schuckertwerke with the delivery of the electrical parts.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, with the operating numbers E 95 01 – 06.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the later Soviet Union again.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparation goods to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesseration work in Dessau, the workability of all six locomotives was confirmed.
With the increasing electrification of the middle German railway network, a growing demand for locomotives for the heavy freight train service led to the rebuilding of the three locomotives E 95 01, E 95 02 and E 95 03, with the remaining locomotives serving as replacement locomotives.
The first batches of E 04, E 44 and E 94 were prioritized.
It was not until the E 94 was withdrawn that it became clear that the number of upgrades could not be further increased, at which time the E 95 became the focus of the upgrade.
The locomotives were initially stationed at the Bahnbetriebswerk Leipzig- Wahren.
They came to the Bahnbetriebswerk Halle P. in 1960.
They were used in a separate Umlaufplan mostly for coal trains from the Geiseltal heading towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated steering of the locomotives proved problematic.
It happened more often that the shooter was left behind in the action.
Then, the on the locomotive constantly travelling Beimann with a hammer and an axe had to dismantle the Schütte during the journey.
Damage to the steam engines occurred more frequently and led to months- long shutdowns of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new locomotives were available and a significant expansion of the electric fleet was not planned at the time, so that the E 95 were withdrawn from service.
They added that the Deutsche Reichsbahn Elektrolokomotives only wanted to operate with one--man crews because of difficulties with the machinery and visibility from the pilot's seat.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid 1969, the E 95 01 was withdrawn on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was never used.
Until the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 replaced the future Museumslokomotive E 77 10 as a Weichenheizanlage on the main railway station in Halle.
It took a long time to convince the authorities of the Reichsbahn that the E 95 as a museum locomotive was worthy of preservation.
In 1979, the initially external renovation of the locomotive began with the goal of being able to present it in the RAW Dessau as a showpiece.
The locomotive belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum in Dresden since 1959 as a non- operational museum locomotive.
1986 the interior of the locomotive was completed.
In the Halle ( Saale ) Museum, the locomotive museum is cared for.
Since 1995, Mitarbeiter of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational rehabilitation of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the Lokomotive could be exhibited for the first time at the Museums BW in Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintings being presented, while the transformers were examined and five steam engines were operational.
The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Silesian Mountains Railway and the branch lines, where they proved to be reliable due to their low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the aircraft were transferred to the Mitteldeutsche Network in Leipzig.
Haupteinsatzgebiet was initially Schlesien.
The Handarbeits model H0 in OVP, the function is good and it is necessary for the locomotive to be covered with dust and to have play marks and the smell of the cellar. It is a very rare handarbeits model and a very small edition. It is possible that the locomotive's bauset came from the small series firm Zschutschke and Bachmann.
The packings can have labels and storage stains.
The F- parts are it.
He has received a bed from them.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which are too narrow and the beam does not fit on the feet.
What they are doing now.

There is no flat ground.
They are, according to the assembly instructions, the right shape, they were only too narrow.
But it is irrelevant.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
They are not flat at his side.
He could have sent it to him.
He says that he has to explain the problem to him again.
A house fire with two lightly injured and high damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a house in Oberbayern.
In addition, damage in the six- million Euro range has been estimated, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport on the adjacent house in Kinsau ( Landsberg am Lech County ) .
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not rule out an intentionally set fire.
The Kripo of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
The comes then much later on.
And he has to pay the transport costs again.
To discredit Fake News, Biontech CEo publishes an AIDs photo.
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in 2021 on the social network " Linkedin " .
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously spoken publicly about his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur released a photo of his coronavirus infection.
The illness of a friend led him to this decision, said Şahin.
The CEo and co---ounder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin has released a photo showing that he has received an infection against the Coronavirus.
In the social media, there were false reports that he had not been vaccinated.
In fact, his wife and he have received three doses of the Biontech- Pfizer vaccine. he wrote on Friday in an article in the network " Linkedin " .
" For several months, friends have urged him to post a photo in which he is wearing a prosthesis, to counter the false rumors.
He had previously rejected it because it was not about him personally.
But an interview in the previous week changed his opinion: "He was deeply disturbed when he learned that an old school friend of his was currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe case of the disease and has been hanging on a respirator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin.
He did not know the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, appears to be fear, which is often caused by misinformation and mistrust. "
It is hard to deal with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In the Internet, circulated an interview with the German Wave, in which Uğur Şahin said that he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as well as the German Welle itself clarified.
" According to Shahin, at the time, it was illegal for him to obtain the vaccine himself.
There is a priority in the distribution of the vaccines in Germany.
In the meantime, the priority has been abolished - and Biontech's CEo has been vaccinated three times.
Thousands of people without electricity due to a fire in the power plant.
In several municipalities in North Rhine- Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening, no electricity and in many cases also no heating.
A fire brigade station was destroyed.
After a fire with severe damage to a power station, thousands of people in the Rhine- Saar region of North Rhine- Westphalia had to be without electricity for 24 hours.
Due to the fire on Friday evening, 41,000 inhabitants and inhabitants were left without light in several communities.
Westnet reported that on Saturday, many emergency power plants were in operation until the large-- scale disruption was finally resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and members of the THW provided assistance in the communes.
The authorities offered shelter in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The Versorger thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
They are aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
They also thanked the affected municipalities, the county, the fire brigades and the military police for their unremitting efforts.
The repair of the damage would still take several days, as the Westnet workers initially only provisorily reopened some of the lines. he said.
A technical defect led to the fire.
The water flows again.
The fire that broke out at 19:15 on Friday destroyed parts of the 10,000 volt switching station in Neunkirch- Seelscheid.
Detailed cleaning and repair work was required.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 volt high voltage level was established.
With the help of these bypasses, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 18 hours, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had again received electricity.
An additional 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirch- Seelscheid were gradually added from 21.30.
Since 23.15 hours, also the last ones affected by the fall had been without electricity.
More than 80 workers from Westnet and partner companies were involved in the work.
The authorities had after the establishment of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that the citizens in their neighborhood take care of elderly or lonely people and report to the local fire brigade headquarters when help is needed. " said Landrat Sebastian Schuster ( CDU ) after a crisis meeting.
The main focus was on the inhabitants of old people's homes when it came to the installation and operation of emergency power plants.
In addition,, according to Behörden reports, temporary care places were set up in schools for those who were not able to care for themselves or were dependent on medical equipment that required electricity.
A good day.
However, the Decke is out of stock in Germany.
He can buy it there and pay for it in euros.
It concerns the Tagesdecke # PRS Org # in blue and green.
He hopes that they have also had a good day and that they remain healthy.
But he cannot put the sub-structure on the table plate.
It is the name of a custom.
There are 3 versions of it.
They wanted plates with a diameter of # Number.
They have a diameter of 155 cm.
Today came his PRS organization,, but he can't put them together and thus shorten them.
He can help him further.
Otherwise, he had to send them back, because they were not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased with a response.
It is actually easier.
Then they make it so.
send him the return ticket by mail.
The repairs are now complete.
He had already tried this before the Chat.
In the meantime, before the acquisition,, however,, he had not restarted the E.P.R.S. organization.
I will now do it.
A very low Gutschrift is almost unacceptable.
They are not in agreement.
Riiber wins the Nordic Combination.
The German Nordic Combiner Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are on the podium at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo was again defeated by the outstanding Norwegian, Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a large lead in the ski jump in the Loipe.
Return of the task number.
When the money is returned to his account.
They have both made a new version and use version 4.5.
it is possible that they have heard of the problem more often.
He has directly with his PRS organization bought a book, it also seems to be about it.
When the door is opened, the news comes out, ups.
This document could not be opened.
Datei is likely to be defective, they report themselves to the customer service.
As far as he can recognize it, it is a PRS org epub film.
They can help him further.
Chat Connection is broken and now.
He also has to work in between..
In order for the paint to be applied evenly and cleanly, it is necessary to clean the parts with a small amount of soap and water of dust, grease and fingerprints, and to rinse and dry them with clear water.
Before painting the first time with a new color on the model, it is suggested that 2 to 3 strokes are practiced.
He can be seen on the inside of the building parts or on a yoghurt bowl.
The first stroke on the building.
He draws the pencil evenly, stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers causes a uniform surface later.
Avoid rapid back and forth strokes with the pencil.
As a result, unrealistic areas are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Begin with the bright colors.
The dark ones could later become visible.
The metallic tones and metallic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unpleasant metallic streaks when they are mixed with normal colors.
Lasse the painted parts dry for a day before he burned them.
The original appearance of the models is achieved by the decals or the abziehbilder.
From the insignia on aircraft to the ship's names to the decorations on model aircraft. The decals give the model the final polish.
Bringing the decals in the correct order while the parts are still reachable.
The cockpit of a plane allows itself or is easier to be attached before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool, at the time of gluing, patience and a calm hand are needed.
Schneide each of the required decals individually and arranged them accordingly.
Decals are also known as "Waterslide paintings" because their backside is covered with water for a short time until the carrier paper becomes dark due to the moisture.
Then he moves the picture only a small part of the paper and places it on the corresponding place on the model ( which he had previously moistened ) .
While the Decal is attached to the model with a tool, it is pulled away from the side.
Attention should be given to whether the image is correctly placed before it is completely removed from the paper, so that it does not stick to the fingers, tear or break.
Excess water with a housewife's apron.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years.
He can only open the book for a short time when he looks at something else, and when he looks at the book again, he can no longer read and has to reopen it and close it again, and the book has to be reopened and closed again to find the place where he has already read.
In the morning of Saturday, he had already communicated with them.
I received it by email.
Also for all 3 packages.
The lamp came in 3 separate packages to him.
despite this, many thanks.
Then, he would go to another place to buy it when the money was returned.
But he can get it back without a problem.
Childbirth prevention at the PKV and the meaning of " a " Versicherungsfall "
Hallo together.
They had been in custody for some time in the custody of the Children's Welfare Board, and now that the dispute with the PKV has been settled, they are suddenly opposed to it.
The Reihe after.
They had applied for the Children's Welfare Program at the PKV beforehand and received the approval for 3 trials.
The experiments were not limited in any way ( e.g. time frame, success, etc. )
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was compensated by the PKV.
A few years later, they attempted to have a second child, and underwent two ( unsuccessful ) attempts, which were not counted as part of the PKV.
They applied again for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After several more attempts ( more attempts were made than agreed upon and logically the most expensive ones were reimbursed by the PKV ) the reimbursement was made to the PKV and they received the disappointing news that instead of 5 attempts ( 2 and 3 ) only 3 attempts were to be reimbursed.
The Begroundation is that with the pregnancy and birth, the other two attempts of the first promise fail.
The second Children's Wish was a new case.
According to the AGB, the accident begins with the treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists.
The questions to the experts in the round here.
The one who has the right is the PKV ( only 3 attempts are reimbursed ) or they ( there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed ).
The PKV was obliged to make it clear in the agreements that with the birth of a child, all further attempts would fail.
The desire for a second child is a new cause of concern.
The unfruitfulness ( caused by closed channels ) is not healed by the first child.
It would have been super if the experts from there gave their opinion.
Many thanks for the first time for their help.
He can give him the three variants by email and he can say that he will be able to get them back the best.
In order.
They will not get any more from them.
When they add up the Umsumes of him and his friend # Name ( same address ) they have apparently lost good customers.
They are allowed to pass it on to their manager.
It is not competitive.
The day before, his colleague told him that the reimbursement order had been issued and now he says that he must first send the thing back.
He can't do anything to prevent the commode from being completely destroyed when he arrives.
In the screenshot, the colleague had written.
It is clear and clear that the reimbursement was initiated and he has not received any reimbursement from the PRS organization.
They can arrange with their manager that they have lost two Stammkunden.
His friend has also ordered various pieces of furniture for their apartment.
The things they are no longer doing.
However, the defect was not discovered until a few months later.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell them as office chairs.
The guarantee of 24 months applies regardless of the manufacturer.
It is not possible for him to obtain another type of packing.
He would dismantle the chest and hand it over to the transport company so that it could be transported.
A good day, he has a question to their series of PRS organs.
These products are promoted with additional Hockern, but they can not be found with them.
They can help.
The theme of the week is the best low budget films.
A low- budget film is a film with a low budget. There is no general definition of a low budget film with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say about it.
A low budget film or low budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the Net there are a lot of lists of low budget films,, such as on Letterboxd.
They have interesting representatives of this category.
What attracts them to it.
and the things that might not have appealed to them at all.
He is a very good customer of Euch, he has already set up two houses completely with Euch's furnishings.
Wanted the best price for the gray leather sofa of Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, it is now also reliable.
Many thanks.
With friendly greetings.
There is no telephone number, a chat where one has to wait for 30 minutes is not a chat.
However, nothing has changed at the Warteposition, he will soon give up again because it did not work there.

" Halber victory " against Belarus with high costs for the European Union.
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can claim a " half victory " in the conflict with the Belarussian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Pressedienst.
According to the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP), the EU has not resolved the conflict.
This stalemate - Belarus does not go as far as the EU, but the EU feels itself as the winner - lasts for a while more.
Bossong said that the treatment of the people at the border was not in accordance with the European human rights convention.
There is an " increasing normalization of pushbacks " by individual EU governments.
Because the EU as a whole is not opposed to it,, the EU as a whole is not opposed to it,, the EU as a whole is not opposed to it,, the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it , the EU as a whole is not opposed to it
This development weakened the unity of the Union.
"She can't overcome it when a member state sets itself in the head and wants to do its own thing,, like Poland, which does not allow the EU border protection agency Frontex to gain access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, with Bossong saying that the agreement on the asylum policy has been hampered because the line " border protection, border protection, border protection " has been strengthened.
A second attempt to cross the border.
According to the Polish Border Guard, migrants have again attempted to cross into Polish territory from Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested and returned to the border on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were attacked by the migrants with stones near the village of Czeremsza.
The soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard recorded 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday night, a group of 28 migrants overcame the border fence.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the previous months.
The EU is throwing out Alexander Lukaschenko as the ruler in Minsk, with the intention of allowing him to enter the EU.
Poland and Lithuania closed border crossings according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened the airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travel to the countries of origin of the migrants in order to prevent their return.
The most effective element of the EU's reaction was the pressure on the airlines.
"The EU has thrown its markets into the balance and demonstrated its determination with hard measures and extraterritorial sanctions to operate.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarussian society was not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus routinely deported thousands of people through the border.

However, Kollegah is constantly reproducing anti--semitic messages.

Then, he is as little serious as Kollegah.

As soon as he becomes a creationist, he has to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is a bunch of nonsense.
And as a result, he has become an enemy of science and is no longer to be taken seriously by his colleagues.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the telescope should be placed as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic and achromatic lens system allows them to use the telescope in a practically error-- free manner up to the edge of the field of view.
Frequently, lupes with magnification indications are marked.
However, these figures apply only to exactly fixed conditions, which seldom correspond to the use conditions.
In order to be able to use the telescope to its full potential, they are asked to take into account the indications in the table " Technical details " ( see the instructions in the packaging ) .
On the surface of the lens of all optical devices – also in the case of telescopes – light reflections occur.
By means of an antireflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
In the optimal use conditions, the reflection on the lens surface is less noticeable.
There are other indications in the accompanying instruction manual ( in German and English ) .

Halo the #PRS 's Org 's team.
He has already been registered with the Kundenkontakt under the number 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Otherwise, he is away as a guest.

Problems with Fibre and Devolo DLan or Magic.
They have had a new fiber- optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
However, he has problems with building a stable WiFi network.
Previously, he had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used the Devolo DLan, which was uninterrupted 50 Mbit reception and transmission until a few incidents.
The new fiber-aschluss sends 500 Mbit to the Fritzbox 7590 and the DLan module attached to the Fritzbox.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the WiFi, transmits less than the full 500, instead, as he moves closer to the house with the module, the amount of WiFi decreases ( i.e. a plug which is 1, 2 or 3 rooms away from the other DLan module transmits less than the full 500 ) .
This leads to the Internet with the new Glasfaser connection now being slower than before ( ~ 45 Mbit ).
He also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLAN, but there were also large losses.
It is hard to explain why with fiber-optics so much Internet speed is lost on the Strom line.
And LAN is the only solution.
It would have been extremely expensive to lay the LAN cable in the house.
He's really frustrated about the fact that he had to create an extra account in order to be able to participate in the game.
Therefore, he would have been even more pleased with a response.
When it is time to change the Giroconto.

During the autumn, many banks have used this time to take advantage of their customers by once again confirming the increase of the fees from the previous year. At the same time, the freebet rates for negative discounts have also been reduced.

She has cut her salary in half and quadrupled her salary for the day.
In the first step, the border was lowered only for customers of the Postbank's conglomerate - to 50,000 euros for Giro and Anlage, and 25,000 euros for Tagesgeld.
In the meantime, the lower Freibetraques for the entire German Bank were confirmed by a spokesman on request.
and not only for new contracts, but also for " new individual agreements with existing customers.
The Commerzbank was already down to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at the Inge Germany.
The low-- cost conscious customers' favourite direct airline DKB has lowered the freebets in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and then to 25,000 euros.
In total, more than 100 banks have a freebet of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Even the Sparda Bank of Berlin has reached 25,000 euros. However, there is still a legal dispute with the Consumer Protection Association, which won the case against this regulation in the first instance at the Berlin Land Court.
In the banks, it has been discussed for a long time that the Institute's re-establishments are possible - for the case that the upper authorities declare the negative discounts in principle as unacceptable and millions of bank customers have to be reimbursed.

Failure, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start despite the installed power supply.
As a result, he has dismantled the battery,, but there is still nothing.
Vllt have their ideas.
A new battery has been ordered, but it is not possible to use the laptop in networked operation.
There is something broken.
Many thanks for their help.
He wants the delivery of the PRS Org until the room.
I don't know how to book it.
He is interested in the # PRS Org 's chair.
He does not know how high the seat is.
Often on tour and still with a lot of equipment.
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem.
The 20- liter capacity can accommodate larger photography equipment without problems, which are securely stowed in the padded Flex Fold teiler.
and the other things he needs, are well organized and separated from the film equipment in the individually configurable interior space.
With the " Update " of the Everyday Line to the version 2 ( V2 ) the series is also presented in a new look.
The sophisticated and minimalistic design has become legendary - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed several highly innovative solutions that effectively protect the interior of the backpacks and, at the same time, allow quick access to the film equipment.
It works with two ways: firstly by the use of the Deckelklape, which can be closed by the Maglatch closure system, and secondly by the use of a well- thought out solution for effective protection, which has already proved effective in the Messenger Bags.
There is a Verschlusshaken made of metal in the closure of the Verschlussklappe, with a corresponding anchor beam on the front side of the rucksack.
In contrast to most backpacks, Peak Design has designed it with four anchor bars, which are firmly riveted and on which the closure hook is attached.
When the rucksack is fully loaded, he takes the highest beam, when it is less loaded, he takes a lower beam.
The Klappenverschluss and Haken are also magnetic.
The rucksack can also be closed reliably without the hook being inserted.
The second possibility distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other backpacks. On both sides of the backpack, there is an opening with a zipper.
The elimination of the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from the top - he must no longer have to rummage through the contents.
At the same time, this clever detail increases the all--round suitability of the backpacks enormously. When, in addition to his photography equipment, he also carries everyday objects or travel equipment.
In the Everyday Backpack, the interior can be individually configured (more below) and so both can be separated from each other without problems, and can also be accessed from the two side openings.
He can also move the rucksack from the right side to the front of his body to reach the camera equipment in the right main compartment while the everyday things stay secure in the left half of the rucksack.
Comfortable and uncomplicated adjustable straps help.
And since the outside of the rucksack is completely made of 100 % recycelled and weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even when it is traveling to Scotland in the autumn.
He is waiting in vain for the email from his support.
# Name # has sent him a letter of confirmation for the appointment.
The shipping company has announced that it would take over the removal of the wrongly delivered tables.
He has not received any news.
He wants it to be completed as soon as possible.
He has already written with the third support assistant,, and in none of them he went further than the promise that he would receive a letter as a confirmation.
It concerns the return of the wrongly delivered custom name.
It is impossible to say when the chest could be delivered again.
It is not an option for him to keep it.
It works.
Many, many thanks for the help.
I also want them to have a beautiful evening.
hello, his number is # Number # and when the article is delivered.
Ordering and payment took place on 12 January 2021.
He received a completely different lamp than he ordered.
I want to call him.
When he gave him the extension of the contract, he also gave him a bigger order,, but he kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that the past year was different than expected, he did not anticipate it and was not able to resolve and clarify it in time.
But the damage was done to him as a customer and he does not accept it.

Coloma is the city where an unanticipated event changed the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered a glowing rock in the waters of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, it spread quickly and led to the so-called " California Gold Rush " of 1849.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were erected and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Each wanted his share in the wealth of the country.
For many, it was " Coloma or Bankruptcy "
In this game, he is a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
He is going to search for gold, to recruit workers, to gather horses and to build a company.
He will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding river flows and surrounding areas.
He is not alone - the other pioneers have apparently the same idea.
He must outperform his Pioneer comrades in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to victory.
They vote simultaneously for their actions, have to manage their resources and build a tableau that more and more works for them ( so--called " engine building " ) .
The buildings on his tableau allow him to become more efficient, gain additional actions or turn the tide in his favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, he can develop his individual playing style with the help of minor adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 ( the year in which the gold in Coloma was discovered ) to 1850 ( the year in which California became an official state.
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the map where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate positions.
When a Standort has the most Pioneers, it receives a Sperre.
This deactivated the first half of the area, reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players alternate actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up camps, crossing rivers, building bridges, opening businesses and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions have been completed, the Pioneers return.
The Anpreiser starts at the beginning of each round at a new location, thereby changing the available actions.
This goes on until the Anpreiser has moved five times and has covered each position once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the player Coloma must defend against an attacking band of bandits.
When the player has enough Revolverhelden and the bandits are numerically superior, they receive rewards.
When they fail, they receive smaller rewards or end up on the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is announced.
The player with the most points wins.

CW psychological violence, sexual abuse and power abuse.
The ARD documentary is now in his Twitter timeline and he watched it immediately.
The children's psychologist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest in talk shows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his 2008 book " Why their children become tyrants " he caused a heated debate about education.
Former patients and caregivers have now made serious accusations against him.
The film is difficult to watch.
And he is very grateful that many people nowadays think differently and act differently.
The parents and other responsible persons can never, never, never have power over the child.
Their goal must always be to give the child freedom for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is appropriate and possible in the situation.
He is still shaking..

He can help her further.
He can't oversee his PRS organization 's acquisitions anymore.
An error has occurred.
Purchasing from the PRS Organization side of the computer.
He has updated his personal data.
The reason for this is unknown.
What he describes is called " awareness " and also sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
They occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common is the hearing of sounds, voices, the rarest is the seeing of pictures and the least common is the feeling of pain.
For this topic relevant, the Kaiserschnitte is an operation that is associated with an increased rate of awareness, because the child is protected from birth until the abnabeling with a very deep anesthesia.
The previous episodes of Awareness must be mentioned in the pre--war speech.
Certain anesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) are associated with a slight increase in risk.
This comment from him describes Awareness accurately,, however, he did not have a dream or nightmare.
He has misinterpreted his comment.
The chair is, however, defective.
The 20 euros are also not enough.
These are legal obligations.
The absolute minimum was that they would return the damaged chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, it is also a standard in the area of commerce.
But they have to examine them again to see if they will at least return the damaged chair..
They sell the second chair privately.
They also lose a lot of money.
He sent them a letter, they did not respond to it.

The Spediteur is Company # Name.

This is the case.
If he does,, he has to cancel the order because he does not know anyone who can carry the heavy items in the first floor.
I would not be called upon.
I had a question formulated.

The " Drive " of a tube endstufe is a major contributor to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sounds.
Theses characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor Schaltung.
With the Volume, Gain and Master Volume Regulators, they can, on the one hand, achieve the desired volume and on the other hand, the amount of distortion in their sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT + series have a unique power level regulator, which allows the sound level to be reduced without affecting the gain and distortion.
In addition, it was stated that with the Power Level Regulator, it is possible to make a power reserve available, when the sound becomes unbearably loud.
Thanks to the Power Level Regulator, the entire potential of the VT + series can be used in every situation.
The Kopfhörerbuchse can also be used as a line out.
The here accompanying signal is, in fact, simulated with a box, so that even with the use of headphones or direct recordings, an eminent " acoustic " sound effect is achieved.

A tuner is also on board, so they do not need a separate tuning instrument.
If, in addition, a VFS5 footstarter is given, the sounds can also be easily called by foot, the effect blocks are turned on and off, and the tempo of the correspondingly compatible effects " tapped ".
For the live performance, this is, in fact, essential.

Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics to be included on the agenda of the negotiations, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency IRna.

He understands it.
Since the delivery took place at the beginning of March, it is possible until then.
He must translate it into English and put it on the package and hand it over to the post office..
he has to do nothing further.
He wants to avoid this, so he writes to him.
He wants to take over the return on his own expense.
The 8 euro return fee is in his eyes an injustice.
It is time for change.
He was greeted by the German parliament and was welcomed in the plenary chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day.
The purpose of the post here.
When one looks at the activity of the German Parliament in the past months, it can be seen that it is not existent.
They are in a winter slump and have extended the summer gap for several months.
Where the problem lies.
I don't know the reason for it.
For the most part, this is due to the dissatisfaction, as some things have fallen apart and as a whole they are dissatisfied.
In the last days, the impression has become more pronounced that many still have a strong desire to participate in the Bundestag.
#The changes they have to make.
At this point, the community around the MBundestag that wants to keep it alive is called upon.
The initiative came from U and Edizvevo, who had become aware of the project in the last days and found a heap of rubble.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, he also wants to call on people to participate in the project once more explicitly, so that the project can continue to exist in the future.
They have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which they can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
The server can be joined through this link.
Goals.
How the MBundestag will function in the future.
The existing orders must be changed or adapted or removed.
As to how they would appear in the future.
The new members are to be recruited.
= They want to create a fair election system.
He is fairly certain that he has forgotten some things, which is not serious,, but the end of the discord.
When their desire and time permits, they come to the Discord to work with and decide the future democratically.
He has also ordered a lamp shield from them, which has not yet been delivered.
Now, he sees that the article is too large and bulky for him and that it is not suitable for his taste.
For this reason, he had already ordered another one from them.
He put it together and noticed it then, when he took the soft cream.
It is very sad about it.
He hopes that this will be returned and that he has received a full reimbursement.
This is also somewhat sad, because the name is much darker than expected.
He also has a question: the Tagesdecke # PRS Org. is also available in an over--sized version, with a size of 240 x 240, for example.
PRS Org must guarantee that the faulty shelf must be removed as soon as possible.
And he asked her to arrange it.
A suitable packing has not been found, the shelf will be dismantled as far as possible for the removal, which must be coordinated with the PRS organization.
PRS can call him on the telephone at any time to agree on an evacuation date.

She responded to the question of why she is vegan.
He today had a conversation with a colleague whom he likes.
She herself has lived for a while as a vegetarian and eats nowadays very rarely meat.
He himself was also a vegetarian for several years.
On the question of whether he had always wanted to be a vegan, and that vegetarianism was a planned interim,, he responded without hesitation.
and that he long thought that he as a vegetarian would support the welfare of animals, but eventually realized and understood that he was also supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, his decision to become a vegan.
In the moment, he had the impression that Missmut came and then defended vegetarianism and said that as a vegetarian, animal suffering is reduced.
He is asking her whether her response to " plump " was.
They responded to the question.
He has the feeling that as a vegan, he is quickly placed in a corner and conflicts arise, without him being able to intervene.
It greets a harmonious vegan.
It is clear that it is not an exception to § 312d of the BGB.
Their " PRS " Organization does not free them from the statutory requirements for distant broadcasting.
He is scheduled to return on the scheduled date, when the @PRS @ Organization @ returns him to his home.

45,000 euros from the Land to strengthen the Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue.
Shortly after, the Rhineland- Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz handed over a grant of 45,000 euros to the new rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Brigade to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein Town Hall.

Over and under water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue and the technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is anticipated that there will be a continuous increase in the number of passengers. This is due to the boom of the river shipping on the Rhine and the Moselle and the further increase in the use of the Lahn as a recreational river.
He bought a book that he could only read 10 percent of, and then the problems began.

First of all, he was thanked for the fact that he was the one who initiated the whole affair, he had also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar role and he was also a member of the armed forces. He also said that he would not be involved in the affair.
The question of rights and wrongs is always presented in a very simplistic way.
In general, it should be said that the Statesman comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary Left,, which would have been clear to everyone.
That, naturally, also in the special uniform and weapon carriers, people to the right of conservatism must also have been clear that these people, naturally, would not be able to cope well with the lived reality because they were, naturally, also clear that there were many Germans with a migrant background, women and homosexuals in the executive. Naturally,, it is also clear that the Germans with a migrant background, women and homosexuals in the executive would not be able to cope well with the lived reality because the Germans with a migrant background, women and homosexuals in the executive would not be able to cope well with the lived reality because the Germans with a migrant background, women and homosexuals in the executive would not be able to cope well with the lived reality because the Germans with a migrant background, women and homosexuals in the executive would not be able to cope well with the lived reality because the Germans with a migrant background, women and homosexuals in the executive would not be able to cope well with the lived reality because the Germans with a migrant background, women and homosexuals in the executive would not be able to co
But also these marginal groups represent a conservative attitude, they are proud of Germany and feel that they have been neglected by overbearing left-- wing politics, even though they perceive this politics to be a threat to them.
Back to the right, because the police and the armed forces are also a cross- section of society, there are also extremist right-wing groups there,, but they are allowed to openly express their opinions there, or they are allowed to make plans that threaten the state, and this is overstated in the media and annoys him.
Naturally, it comes before that also police officers and soldiers, who were often in overseas missions, began to generalize and also say things that are controversial and politically incorrect.
It also comes before that the right-- minded comrades meet and engage in a mutual exchange of ideas.
In spite of this, it is widely believed that this is a good way of combating it and that political education and awareness campaigns are being used to counter it.
Germany is so heavily international entangled and this is also a good thing according to his opinion that it is not possible for them to have right-wing racists and Nazis in their ranks.
That he does not understand, the other Korb has also been ordered from the German side.
The reason for this to come from England.

He is looking forward to their responses.

A career in social work, as a person with a disordered personality.
He has an education in the field of software development and has been out of work for about a year.
However, he feels that this profession is not the right one for him, which is why he has been thinking for a long time that he would start again and study social work.
The problem is that he has a self--eager ( b.w. ängstily avoiding ) personality disorder.
This means that he has no sense of self- worth and is therefore shy.
He does not have a problem with people on a professional level to talk, but it is very difficult for him to have friendly conversations, and he has been said to be unapproachable ( although he has become more approachable ). .
He can become a social worker.
He does not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, the drug counseling or the family aid.
However, he does not know exactly how the concrete workplace reality is like he imagines it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it in the Internet.
The ÄVPS has already led to problems ( for him, emotionally, because it makes him feel down every time his code is criticized " and it is difficult for him to ask his more experienced colleagues for help " and he feels that he is underpaid " etc.
The problems are likely to be present in all professions, but he wanted to emphasize them in particular.
The sofa has been returned to them.
There was also no confirmation for it.

The protein taken in by the bird is broken down in the bird's gastrointestrial tract into the individual amino acids and then rebuilt from these amino acids to form the bird 's own protein, which is needed for the formation of the bird 's feathers.
The plumage development of the nestling and the plumage rebuilding of the maturing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a high demand for the entire organism of the animal.
It is necessary to take into account that Nekton Bio cannot be used during the breeding season because it can cause disruptions in the breeding process.
In the wake of the shortage of Nektoton B, the daily supply of Nektoton S ( a multivitamin preparation ) and Nektoton MS ( a mineral substance preparation ) was resumed.

The plumage development of the nestling and the plumage rebuilding of the maturing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a high demand for the entire organism of the animal.
It is necessary to take into account that Nekton Bio is not allowed to be distributed during the breeding season because it can cause disruptions in the breeding process.
In the aftermath of the Nekton Bios, the daily supply of vitamins with Nekton S ( a multivitamin preparation ) and Nekton MSA ( a mineral substance preparation ) was resumed.
1 gram of Nectron Bio on 250 milliliters of water or 100 grams of soft food.
It was suggested that only so much drinking water and soft food was to be prepared, and that the water and food was to be changed daily.
A stained messlöffel ( inliegend ) is equivalent to 1 gram of neutron bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, the double or triple dosage of Nectron Bio can be given at the beginning, until the formation of new feathers is visible.
After that, the normal dosage is given until the new feathers are fully formed.
Lagering of Nekton Bio should be in dry conditions without sunlight, between 15 ° and 25 ° C.

The statement of a member of the community in opposition to the statute.
Legal advice in German.
He has the following problems.
On their property, a walnut tree is to be felled.
Also a complaint was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to him that the cases of fruit trees and consequently the walnut are not part of the statute.
In the statute, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a tree to be protected.
He can now rely on the statements of the employees or not.
On the other side, he must rely on the opinion of an expert.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
I thanked for their responses.
The understanding they have.
Dann, the new packaging will be used.

Eilmelding about a severe traffic accident in Selb.
A heavy traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Anschlussstelle Selb- Nord and Plößberg.
According to the police's Pressealarm ( 14:03 Uhr ), a Pkw collided with a vehicle in the opposite direction while overtaking.
There are injured.
Ah okay understands.
Good, then many thanks that it went so smoothly.
Advice and ideas for further career.
First happy Christmas for them.
My Christmas is not as good as usual, because his beloved head is in a state of complete disorder.
Before he now leaves the country, he needs advice from people who know the situation in some way, that is, from them.
He is currently doing the Ref as a substitute..
Originally, he studied in a different field and worked in a related field ( in order to remain anonymous, he does not reveal his exact field of study ).
The whole thing became boring to him and he then looked for alternatives that gave him more fun.
At some point, he became a pastor and was sure that this was the right thing to do, even though the conditions were more difficult than in his previous job.
He is now at the third " he googles other positions " .
And it is only half a year since.
In the previous games, he has always decided to continue and finish the Ref, after which he can still change direction.
However, he is completely exhausted.
He had the last month so little free time that he was completely exhausted.
Although it is the holiday season, there is still a large amount of work awaiting him.
Before the Ref, he always thought that he was stress resistant, but his weekend was also his weekend and his evening was also his evening.
He had free time.
and the stress on the job was the same in the moment.
He himself is now finding the family celebration to be too stressful.
And then, there are these rigid structures that annoy him even more.
In general, it is fun and from the outside, the Ref is going well, the feedback is good.
But he is completely exhausted and is wondering how much stress his body can withstand before it completely breaks down..
He wonders whether he wants to spend the rest of his working life in this way,, especially when he reads some of their contributions,, or whether he should go back to the area where he was most respected, where he could take time off when he needed it, and where he was paid fairly for the work he did in a team, rather than as a lone fighter.
But then he asks whether he is still in the same place as he is now and unhappy.
They notice that it is all irrational,, but they may have ideas or ideas as an outsider in this situation, that she is completely exhausted and begins to cry at the smallest thought of it.
Decisions are now being made in an emotional way, this is likely to lead to nothing good.
But perhaps their views can help to see a little light at the end of the tunnels or to enjoy Christmas for the first time..
Danke for the reading and apologized for the whining tone of his voice.
He hopes that his situation has become somewhat clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of Vox has been steadily developed, which included the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the " Valve Reactor " control system, which perfectly reproduces the behaviour of a trombone.
With the VT20x, the VT40x and the VT100x Amps, a brand new modeling engine is presented, which in terms of sound is on the latest state of technology.
Thanks to the Vet Technology ( Virtual Element Technology ) based on the analysis of the parts and the amplification system, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These Amps also contain the more advanced Valvetronix preamplifiers.
This is partly based on real analog switches, because these give the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated arrangement, the VTX amplifier has a closed housing and a bass--reflecting system, from which the natural resonances only sprout.
With the " Tone Room " software of Vox, they can recreate historical facts on the virtual level, even correcting and altering the sound of the guitar and the effects so that they sound as they have always imagined.
The perfect combination of Röhren sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the 2001 presented Vox Valve Reactor technology.
It has since been revised several times to accommodate new sound requirements, and in 2010, the Vox Valvetronix Series received a performance boost with the addition of more dynamics and a number of new and decisive reinforcement models.
From the handy VT 20 + to the VT 120 + with two speakers, the new VT + Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists on the hunt for a maximum variety of sounds would find it.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamism of a vacuum tube amplifier. They expect a thick sound, a nuanced reproduction of the dynamics of the playing and the sound of the strings, and a prompt response.
During an initial analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the end stage of the amplifier was characterized by the sound of a valve amplifier and developed the Vox Valve Reactor technology on this basis.
The with a 12AX7 Röhre best-ucked Valve Reactor Schaltung of each VT + Verstärkers forms the behavior of the subtle nuances and the sound character of the Röhrenverstärkers perfectly.
NBA, despite 20 points from Wagner, the Magic lost to the Clippers.
The defeat series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but the victory over the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.

The large main compartment is also adjustable, with three individually placed and foldable Klett closure parts that are suitable for all types of cameras, from spiegelless system cameras of all sizes up to full--format spiegelreflex cameras.
In the end, the size of the camera and the lens determines what can be carried in the rucksack.
A possible armament would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a spotlight.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony A7 series or the Fuji XT2 still have room for additional lenses.
In addition, one can also store a lot of additional equipment.
And if he has a small DSLM camera ( MFT cameras from Olympus and Fujifilm X or E series ) he can use the backpack for his equipment and for other things.
Even the drone pilots choose the Everyday Backpack 20L as the optimal choice, because the rucksack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including the remote control and equipment.
A volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma, one of the longest in history.
In the short three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Islands caused great damage.
There is an end in sight.
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
Previously, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 lasted for 84 days as the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable records of previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past days, but vulcanologists were not able to predict when it would end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable " said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state television channel RTVE.
Losses in millions of dollars.
In the three months since the breakout, the more than 1000 degrees Celsius hot lava has destroyed more than 2,900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
It covers an area of almost 1700 football fields..
More than 7,000 inhabitants were evacuated and the damage is estimated to be more than 90 million euros.
Before the coast, two new islands were formed by eroded lava with an area of approximately 50 hectares.
The banana industry, which is of great importance for the island, was severely affected, with about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly living on it and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely damaged, the newspaper " El País " wrote.
Christmas and the gifts.
Christmas is on the doorstep and especially the children are not able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension to have a seductive effect.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still unite the increasingly divided society.
The most important thing is to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French anthropologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, has been a " peace treaty between primitive peoples " is revived and re-filled with life in the context of the tradition.
As from Nikolaus, the Christchild became.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants, through whom the Christmas days were associated with the blessing.
Previously, gifts were given on St. Nicholas' Day in various forms.
The background of the still today popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional form of giving, the German tradition of St. Nicholas gift-- giving emerged, especially among children.
Protestants objected to this tradition because they rejected the idea of saints as mediators between God and humans.
From these reasons, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther transformed the figure of St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thereby established a new tradition line.
The focus of the festivities shifted to the Christmas Eve.
Since the majority of Protestants do not see these details as an issue, only a few are angered by the fact that the tradition of St. Nicholas, which is similar to the tradition of St. Martin with the singing of the St. Martin's song and the St. Martin's procession, is still an important part of the pre--Christmas period.
Today, one finds in Stiefelfeld in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
The diversity of traditions in Christian countries.
The tradition of the Schenkens goes back to the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the Feast of St. Nicholas was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, there is a chaos over the issue of who is to give the children the gifts.
In Germany, it varies from region to region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, a sort of St. Nicholas, who has acquired various characteristics over time.
These include, for example, his white Rauschebart, which has little resemblance to the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference of chimneys to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure of the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy, the Witch Hexe Befana gives the way to the Jesuschild.
In Scandinavia, beings from folklore sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought fame.
There are not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christkind is responsible for the distribution of gifts.

Hail the lovely womenfolk.
He hopes that he has done everything right and that this is his first post after a year of reddit.
To his problem, he started to take the Pille again about five years ago, mainly because he had severe pain during the Periode and bad PMS before the Periode.

The commode is made of glass and the entire sides are broken, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken.

Danke for the news.
but only 20 euros.
The original value of this chair was 100,000 euros.
No, this is the case with all the books, which is the reason for the request from the PRS organization,, because it is a general problem.
Scheduling ( EK )
Hello dear colleagues and colleagues.
He has been in the RF since the summer, he likes the training,, but he still has problems planning his studies in geography..
However, his school is technically poorly equipped, so he can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In the school, he can also copy S and W films for free, which is an annoyance for him.
He needs to plan his hours for a long time.
They are, for example, currently working on the theme of geofactors, and at his side he stands almost every hour.
In principle, the methods used are the same, but at the same time, he also wants to use less time for training sessions ( which he also uses for UBs and so on ). .
When planning, he usually starts from the goal he wants to achieve and then thinks about how he can achieve it ( most of the time he creates a work sheet with texts from books that his school does not have.
They have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, he is not satisfied.
Daher also the work sheets.
Perhaps he can teach him how to work efficiently with the book.
He would have been delighted.
I would like to return the @ PRS @ Organization @ from the @ Number @ list.
He has already decided on a new job at the PRS organization,, but he would like the return to be completed as quickly as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed to enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and complains of income losses.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations damage from the point of view of the Handels Association of Germany ( HDE ) the important Christmas trade.
In transactions with goods of non- daily use, breakdowns in sales were criticized by HDE's head of operations, Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey of 1,100 dealers by the HDE, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative view of the remaining days of the year.
Many had already finished their Christmas business.
"The actual high point of the year, which was supposed to be, is now often a hole without a bottom " said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre- crisis sales in the previous week.
It went well only in the foodstores and in the online area.
The Federation demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with a mask, with a distance and a hygiene concept was a safe affair, said the head of the company.
" 2G at the market does not bring them further in the fight against the pandemic. he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off passengers and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the band regulation would be allowed throughout the country.
After that, every customer would only have to pass through 2G ( infected or cured ) control once and would be allowed to enter all businesses with the band on that day.
In addition, in the retail sector,, like previously in the public transport with the 3G rule ( those who have been vaccinated, those who have recovered or those who have been tested ) , stichprove surveys are insufficient.
Even the specialized on shopping centers real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The Frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre--corona levels and the umsales at about 90 percent.
These numbers are now in the middle of the so important Christmas business, the chairman of the board Wilhelm Wellner said to the " Economic Week " .
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs associated with the Center, solutions were sought and approved.
This also includes the so-called Bändchen solution, in which " the visitors, for example, once at a central location in the center present their 2G proof and then, wearing an armband similar to those used in a club hotel, can freely enter all the shops.
He has recently ordered and received the PRS Organization..
The Spiegel has a scratch and the frame also has a flaw, which was covered with a yellow substance.
It looks ugly.
He would like to return the Spiegel and has already re-packed and glued it back into the package.
It is necessary for the Retour to continue to move forward.
The Lampe is designed for Dual Balance, based on new, flat SMD - LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp is controlled by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities.
In addition to the adjustment of the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures, daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to adjust the color temperature in the range of 3100 – 5650K manually and to store it.
They use the current configuration of the flash memory.
A special feature of the controllers is that they are easy and intuitive to use.
The Leuchte produces a very strong light stream with a soft light of high quality, completely free of flickering.
The beam angle of 120 degrees with the ability to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is impressive.
In addition, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
They can adjust the luminosity almost without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool both on the film set and in the studio..
The optional available DMX 512 controller enables the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the Leuchte is the control panel, it consists of switches and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness level in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F Akkus ( which are not included in the delivery ) .
The viewer has up to three panels for brightness and color temperature.
In order to achieve the positioning of the individual Einstellations on the Speicher plates, it is simply achieved by longer pressing of one of the Speichertastes that are occupied.
The lamp controller records the current state of the lamp when it is shut down, so that when the lamp is restarted, the same situation is restored - very practical in the studio when, for example, the camera is set to a specific color temperature.
Working with batteries is one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120. this is due to the ability to operate with good NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen ( and women ) - so they can use existing equipment.
The DL 3120 can also be tested before the set, it has a battery tester built in, and for each of the two battery compartments there is a score in the two display panels ( the upper one for the upper battery compartment and the lower one for the lower one.
Furthermore, it is also possible to continuously supply the projector with electricity through the supplied network.
The construction of the projectors is very simple.
They have a 16 mm hinge as an attachment, so that they can be directly attached to their photostable.
The inclination is ensured by the positioning of stabilizers on both sides.
It was emphasized that the mechanical components are also extremely high- quality and that they are designed to be used in a hard environment.
In addition, a Neigegelenk is included in the package.
Grossartig is that the package also contains a bag.
This means that they can transport the Leuchte with all the accessories that they may still want to buy, without any problems.
I's sad that he has given it away and it is too small.
"The party that they wanted to throw " after a torrid comeback against Leverkusen.
It was a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a row defeated Hesse were apparently on the way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
However, then the SGE turned the game around and scored five goals within a good hour and won fiercely with 5-2. "It's insane what the boys have done today " jubilated coach Oliver Glasner at DAZn and spoke a " general praise to all the players who were there.
However, at the beginning, it looked like another setback for the now ninth- placed Frankfurters, who were behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had the Leverkusener with a 2-0 lead.
What then happened also impressed the SG coach.
"As the players then returned to the field and showed a fantastic performance, Glasner continued.
He is extremely happy with the performance they have shown and also with the result.
Even defensive player Christopher Lenz, who returned to the field for the first time since the fourth game and overcame his muscle injury, also emphasized the moral of his teammates.
He believes that his team's mentality is unbelievably strong, said the 27-year old and was pleased with a glance at the result in particular for the spectators.
This was the party that they wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to focus on himself, he sees himself as well as in terms of the personnel situation, in a good position.
It is extraordinary that all the players are fit in December, that all the players are physically in a top condition.
It is Top- Work in the medical department, but also the players live high professionally.
He wanted to " step forward step by step and remain modest " and continue the tasks until the end of the year " on this level " .
The next match is scheduled for 18: 30 on Wednesday as part of the English Week against Borussia Mönchengladbach ( on Sky ) .
He received the mail that his package was returned to him due to his own fault.
He has tried to contact @ PRS Org @ and has been rebuffed.
It can be sent directly back to him or it must wait until the money is returned and the order is reissued.
But for him, this would mean that he would not be able to order again because it had already been delayed for a long time.
They have already been on the board of directors of the PRS..
Dampers for the women's handball team before the quarterfinal against Spain.
Germany's women's handball team walked away from the humiliating defeat against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes on the court.
At the end of the World Championship main round, the DHB selection lost to Spain 16-32 (8 - 13 ) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers with a heavy defeat and must now face the host country in the quarterfinals.
They were too nervous and had too much respect for the opponent, coach Henk Groener judged.
Against Spain, they must appear differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8 points as second behind the Danes (10 points) .
It is sad that they did not take the flow with them.
It was a bad game from all sides, they had to lose it. said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to qualify for the semi--finals against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on the following day, a significant improvement is needed to keep the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three- times Olympic champion Denmark was the backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
" They were not there in the attack or in the defense, defensive player Xenia Smits said, and demanded that " they have to move forward quickly " .
From front to back, not on the height.
Anders than in the previous five tournament matches, the German team was not on the same level from the start of the match.
Failures and technical errors in the attack and holes in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the job and prevented worse with several saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9 minutes and 30 seconds, when Grijseels completed a quick counterattack.
The expected initial ignition was not achieved.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women were hardly able to get into the scene, and when they did, they often failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game started with a 3-10 deficit after 20 minutes due to an early lead and Mia Zschocke was forced to leave the field due to a hard foul in the 20th minute.
In the quarterfinals, she can again participate.
Only in the final phase of the first half, the DHB selection started to get into the game, and by the end of the first half they were five goals ahead.
The only faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes when the score was 9-19.
The Groener Schützlings again sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well--prepared opponent who is among the medal candidates at the end of the tournament.
As a result, the German team was not able to achieve a performance increase and went as a clear loser from the court.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in the Christmas period.
In the framework of the Reddit Advent Calendar, they have won the Nikolaustag and use it as an opportunity to focus on family traditions in the pre-- Christmas period, the Advent, Nikolaus and the Christmas festivities.
As was the case at home at that time.
Like at their Partner's Partner.
They wanted to pass on their traditions to their children.
What is the best for the children.
The Stiefel putter.
Plate-cakes.
Bumblebees.
Music is played.
The Weihnachtsmann comes, the Christkind or it is a gift from Oma and Opa.
Whatever they do, they all try to make it as good as possible as a family around Weihnachten..
It is said that these traditions are now firmly established, or that they vary from year to year. He says that in his family, the traditions are now firmly established or that they vary from year to year.

"It's going on with them. "
The title says that he is working as a field doctor in mobile impfing teams, in which ( previously only ) the BioNTich and Pfizer impfing substance is used in care homes.
Since they are almost complete, they are then sent to a large part to a part of the immunization centers..
He is willing to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also on medical issues, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. " He takes medication X and tolerates it with the immunization. "
In his area of responsibility is the dissemination of the immunization, the indication ( the person has the right to be immunized according to the corona immunization law and has no grounds against it ), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency treatment of allergic reactions ( which has never occurred ). .
The injection itself is delegated to qualified personnel,, such as medical assistants.
In Impfeteams, however, they are often absent,, but " only " ( by God's will ) pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of the infectious substance, but they are not able to perform the injections themselves, so that he also performs most of the injections himself.
Heavy " Huidlerer " problem is solved in Amberg.
This is a " Huidlerer " .
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger,, it has caused a lot of controversy in the BR television show " Winners in Bavaria " .
Different from many previous days, the term remained unchanged in the series " Host mi " this time.
No, it was a " nervous man ".
and also no one, " who has to move quickly.
The people heard that the TV moderator was completely wrong.
According to the man from Amberg, the man from Amberg, the man from Amberg, the man from Amberg, the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man
"The Huidlerer, as seen by the audience, is a Lappen who is wiping the stove. "
Dialektologist Antony Rowley, from the Bavarian Television since years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Bavarian term, derived from the more well--known Mundart word "Houdern.
With the closure of a gap in education, many who had lived in the area of Amberg for a long time.
He has been unable to buy books for two weeks.
It comes after the confirmation with the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
He has re---started the @ PRS @ Org @ with the PC connected, synchronized and repaired.
There has been no help.
The choice of wheels for the racing bike is actually very safe.
In the morning, he was full of energy because he still wanted to train a little for his bicycle tour in the coming week.
Said and done and he took off with his racing bike, which he bought the day before on eBay.
The first 40 km were also beautiful,, but then the same thing happened in every inner city ( this time in Krefield ) .
Glassplitter on the track.
Zack's barking, loud screeching and his rear wheels did not want to participate in the rest of the route.
Due to the fact that he did not have any real possibility of obtaining his replacement armor and shield, he had to turn around and take the first available train back to his home.
It was then also financially not so bad,, perhaps it is also better when he changes the wheels again during the Radtour.
Now, he stands before a question and hopes that they can help him.
Because he has a relatively long journey over several days ahead of him, he would not want to encounter this problem again.
Now, it was not as bad, because the old wheels of the previous owner ( a very nice old man who came to pick up the bicycle on the day it was handed over and had traveled 140 km on them in one day ) were also considered to be suboptimal because they had been used for many years on a roller.
When, however, he thinks that he has to make a change of wheels at a speed of 80 to 90 km/ h, he is really unhappy.
He had a conversation with an older man at the airport who asked him why he did not have the Marathon Plus tires, which are supposed to be unbreakable.
The whole thing now sounds very tempting.
But they are really so uncapable.
He has little desire to give up 40 euros now, only to be disappointed later.
In addition, he is wondering about the 25 x 622 on the running track.
However, there are also ( apparently ) at the Marathon Plus Reifens,, but the majority is still wider.
This is a problem.
or they would have her with a racing bicycle generally to other types of bicycle.

After the release of their new high- end recordings B 100 - 6 OHms, it was only a matter of time until the Solo Series also received new members.
The new Sprössling is called Solo 15 and resembles the large predecessors with the B 200 – 6 OHm.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable design foot is included directly, with the aim of raising the position of the loudspeaker to the correct position.
It has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The Solo 15 is well suited for people with a relatively low maximum sound level, but with an exceptionally high level of musicality.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is
However, this does not mean that the Solo 15 sounds weak.
On the other hand, they grow to an impressive size and for their size they are very impressive and accurate.
The Solo 15 was tuned with a slight high tone increase.
This is common among broadband users because the high frequencies are increasingly concentrated in order to optimize.
The Solo 15 is perfectly placed on the Hearing Place with a very clear and fine sound.
The high tone area is reduced and so the sound image is made warmer.
thanks to the point sound source, the individual components of a musical piece are located in an optimal stereodimensional sharp and precise manner.
The very low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHm cause a similar dynamics.
The Solo 15 complements not only the Solo Series, but enlarges it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of his constructions, it is important to start thinking about the final appearance of the loudspeakers to be made, in order to make corresponding changes to the construction.
If, for example, the housing is to be furnished, the lowering of the loudspeakers must be adjusted accordingly, as the furnishing adds further material.
After all the plates had been cut,, for example, in the Baumarkt , a 8 mm hole was bored into the floor at the corresponding place to allow the cable to be easily inserted later.
With the help of an upper frase, now the speaker opening in the front is made, so that the B 100 – 6 OHm can be used in a straight line.
On the back, this opening was to be flanked by a 45° angle to maximize the area of the speaker chassis.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHm have a break in the phase, as shown in the " detail phase " image.
After this, the actual construction of the box begins and one of the two sidewalls is placed on a flat surface in front of him.
On these, the rear wall, the roof, the front wall and the floor are cemented.
In addition, the three reinforcements and the reinforcement cement were to be installed and cemented.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in their material strength depending on whether they use finished beams from the timber yard instead of 16 mm MDF..
In the next stage, the second side is attached.
Then follow the plates of the feet, the two sides and the front.
By means of a suitable Lochkreissäge or a Forstnerbohrers, the placement of the holes for the bassreflector pipes, as well as the attachment of the back wall clamp is facilitated.
He then uses a circular saw to round all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the footplate can also be rounded.
In the following, the footplate is firmly attached to the base of the house with screws and with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre--drilling ( 2.5 mm drilling ) of the attachment points of the speaker chassis and the attachment clamp.
After the housing of wood dust was cleaned, the cable laying began.
This is achieved by the 35 mm Bassreflex opening in the rear wall.
He then pulls the entire and uncut cable piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, leaving it there for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and left there loosely hanging.
Following this, the frequency changer is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the Frequenzweiche, as well as the corresponding attachment plan can be found in the construction manual for the Solo 15.
The frequency switcher was installed and the connection terminal was bolted, followed by the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the box, which is not completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with some skill, it is possible to drop Heißkleber onto the opening and thus close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHm and with a small lamp, it is possible to examine the sealing accordingly.
Then follows the damping of the sound according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHm is connected to the B 100 – 6 OHm and is fastened to the B 100 – 6 OHm with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the positive cable ( marked cables ) at the positive pole of the speakers ( larger contact ) are tied.
At the end, the bass reflex tube is shortened to 28 mm ( the total length of the tube ) and inserted.
For the damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening of the bass reflex tunnel should be preserved.
He can also give an order now and start delivering in June..

Finally, they are able to announce that they will also organize the Oscars again in 2019.
It is not possible to have more than four people in the studio due to known reasons, which means a higher planning effort and the short notice of the announcement.
There will be at least three people on the switch, so that the Oscars 2021 would be broadcast with at least 7 people on the switch and thousands of them watching it.
= They do their best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it is after all a pandemic, they are still trying to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
