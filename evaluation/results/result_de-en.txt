As long as they are still young enough to be children, he does not see a problem.
When his K1 is alone for a short time and it is OK for him, that is good.
He can himself best assess whether it is suitable for his children.
It is not the case that he wraps the K2 and stays with him for hours until he falls asleep.
Legally, it is questionable.
The statement of the psychologist may also come from this.
In the event of a fire, an invasion or an earthquake, it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
If this is a risk, he wants to take,, it is up to his discretion.

There are more suicides and there is a new protagonist, a photographer who is assigned to the site of each suicide to document and upload the footage to the internet.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist runs an underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the brain that suppresses an anxiety center, and the patients eventually overcome their anxiety in the most extreme way.
( A woman jumped out of the window and another drove herself to death intentionally )
This situation is called " the fight " in the book.

Wegen Omikron, Johnson is pushing ahead with the Auffrischimpfing.

Every adult in England would have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that three months had passed since the second impfing.
The original target date was at the end of January.
The British Government would also provide additional support to accelerate the campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
He is facing the threat of the Omikron variant, a situation that requires the immunization to be strengthened, he said Johnson.
The good news was that the protective level with a third immunization doses would be raised again.
"Let's booster now " said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more cases of the Omicron strain were recorded in the United Kingdom, bringing the total to 3,137.

He is for the idea that all people should be represented with pronouns.
He has sent a letter of application.
He received the invitation to a meeting by mail.
He wants to respond to the e--mail.
However, the name is not " Peter " but a somewhat more complicated name.
He has been Googled and, depending on his or her cultural background, he or she is either a man or a woman.
I don't know how he should write the e-mail.
I can't do it alone.
He is an immigrant and does not want to have officials walking on his feet.
The conclusion is that each person should present themselves with pronouns.
He has 5 books in total.

[ CW ) The feeling when he does not help.
The content of the warning is about domestic violence.
I have to write something from the soul.
He ( 21 ) often comes into contact with the victims ( and perpetrators ) of domestic violence because of his job.
A theme that often bothers her is that many victims are not helped or that she cannot help them.
He is quite clear that they are not able to do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in his profession that move him more than when he cannot do anything in such situations.
He sees the blue spots, the blood, the eyes of despair.
But even in conversation with the perpetrator, with the perpetrator far outside the range of sight and hearing, it is not possible to reach him.
He does not know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of the children from this to enter.
That he always wanted to make clear, to a large extent close to tears, that it is possible to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they are not just victims of violence.
Often, he wishes that he could be there in every case to help, but he knows that he is not able to do so.
It becomes easier, but it never becomes easier.
I always thinks about the fact that they are worth living without violence, that is so important.
" Arcane " on Netflix, the series " League of Legends "
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names and an impressive production, " Arcane , the series from the " League of Legends " computer game universe, started on Netflix in 2014.
Because of the already announced two seasons.
The Basketball Bundesliga match between the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg and the Merlins Crailsheim ended in a debacle for the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg.
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick was untroubled.
For the second time within three months, the Giants lost to Crailsheim - and again.
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick said that the team still had a bit of resentment from the cup defeat against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in October.
After the game,, however, he has not been laid down - instead he has increased after the 61 - 72 (28 – 38 ) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.

Represented by a statistics, the entire Dilemma is expressed by the 13 percent quota, 4 goals ( all of them from the young Johannes Patrick ) from a total of 31 attempts.
After the victory at Teneriffa, they were not concentrated enough and did not execute what they trained.
Specifically to move the ball.
Ganz anders reacted to his counterpart Sebastian Gleim's " a great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg. " said the happy coach.
"It has felt like being in front of 10,000 people.
There were only 750 spectators allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they were allowed to enter the stadium at their own expense.
In addition, due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
"The best player he ever coached " praised Gleim.
Whilst in Patrick's team, the main performers, Jordan Hulls ( 0 points ) and Jonah Radebaugh ( 7 points on the entire line failed.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the Giants prevented a total disaster and came up to eight points behind, after they had already been 39 – 59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
A lot of time has not been wasted, fortunately.
Already on Wednesday (19:00) the giants received the Skyliners from Frankfurt, and then also in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.

He is able to charm his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
He is currently with the programme " Good Day, Lovely Glory " on tour - if he appears, he can do it.
Originally, Max Raabe was going to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig on Sunday.

German Minister of the Interior Klara Geywitz says that through expropriation, no new housing is created.
The new Federal Minister of the Interior, Klara Geywitz ( SPD ) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing conglomerates, as it has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
" With an Enteignment, no new housing is created, it only changes the ownership structure. " Geywitz said in an interview with the " Tagesspiegel " ( Sunday ) .
His goal is to give the tenants security that their rent remains affordable in the next years.
A bizarre mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations, is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Green Party and the Left Party will set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the people's vote.
However, when the situation did not improve, Geywitz was in talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The Coalition Agreement stipulates a Mietpreisbremse until 2029, a restriction of Mieters' housing increases in overcrowded housing markets and the expansion of the Mietspiegels.
He would meet with the Justice Minister to implement it as soon as possible.
When the rental market does not calm down,, the SPD politician said that she and her coalition partners are discussing further steps.

At least 100 deaths from tornadoes in Kentucky.
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes swept across the United States.
Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths could be attributed.
The pictures from there resemble a war zone.
In the night of Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe damage and possibly hundreds of deaths in the United States.
The storms have left an approximately 320 kilometer long swath of devastation, particularly in the state of Kentucky.
Dessen Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, all over where the tornado passed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops and government buildings are simply demolished.
Parts of industrial buildings and roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that it is possible.
He estimates that there are up to 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, the official numbers rise daily.

Companies pay bonuses and change advertising slogans.
While the Federal Government has rejected the proposal for a salary premium, the companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offer their employees salary premiums for the vaccination.
They are on the same line with the Social Partners OGB and the Economic Chamber, who today demanded financial incentives for an infection.

The reduced design allowed all functions, including the choice between espresso, Americano, ristretto and a mild coffee, to be determined by four knobs.
Thanks to the Dampflanze, they are also able to produce coffee milk and milk mousse specialities.
Help with the first own campaign.
Boron to the Grusse.
He is currently leading a group of four friends on an adventure over the Greifenpass and wants his heroes to seamlessly enter a story written specifically for the player.
They play DSA 5.
The great arch was made, the villains and their motivations were written, the individual acts were imagined and now he is in the process of writing the opening adventure and has already stumbled over his own feet.
The premise is that the heroes have a wagon carrying grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
It is up to Dort to develop the story.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins await the hero in a trap..
He wants the player characters to have the possibility to solve the confrontation in different ways, to persuade, to act, to threaten, to recognize the danger early.
Group strength 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears and 6 armed with bows and swords.
At Nichtbemerken, the Goblins ambushed the hero in a hollow way and flanked him to the left and right with bows armed with the wagon, while two with spears stopped the wagon.
One is that the Helden will die, and the other is that the Helden is killed by the enemy.
The heroes all become unconscious and are then found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster,, a halfelf.
The carriage is gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, the half-elf and two of his knights come to the hero's aid.
The carriage is still there, everything is super.
Deus ex Machina from Lösion 2.
The Encounter as an introduction to the adventure is too much.
The Group of Goblins later plays a decisive role and is not only cannon fodder.
I was not expecting so many responses, in particular not with so many good proposals and suggestions.
He would be able to implement many of their ideas and he now has more confidence in his narrative.
He has disassembled the lamp again.
and again reunited.
However, it still does not work.
Deswegen, he would still like to send her back.
He can then remove the backsides to allow the lamp to be packed and transported to the Prussian Museum.
Transport costs and time savings and, at the same time, the environment is relieved.
If he needs more than one article, he klicks first on " now buys " when he has all the articles in the warehouse.
Therefore, the Kombiversand is automatically calculated and he gets everything in a package.
Through this procedure, he saves the more than double transportation and transportation costs, and the environment is happy because unnecessary transportation materials and unnecessary fuel for the transportation of multiple packages are not used.
Faster delivery with DHL, DPD and the German Post.
Normally, Deine Sendings are sent out at 14:00 Uhr, at the time of payment,, on the same day.
So that Dein Paket arrives at him as soon as possible, he must pay attention to the fact that his name is fully written on his letter box and his bell.
I want him to send his package to a packing station.
Then he chooses DHL, because only DHL is allowed to deliver at DHL cargo stations.
They sent him an e--mail with the dispatch number, if he had chosen DHL or DPD as the carrier.
thus, he can see where his package is located as early as 22:00.
His satisfaction is their goal - all five stars count.
When he is satisfied with them, they are happy when he praises them positively and gives them five stars.
In the event that not all to his full satisfaction has been achieved, he would have been grateful if he had reported to them before issuing a verdict.
Only then, they have the chance to do everything to make him happy.
They have nothing to do with the throne.
the Riss was a river, a tributary of the Rhine, which flowed into the Rhine in the vicinity of the village of Riss.
I was just sitting on the bench.
There was the lower part, so the part with the storage space damaged.
Then all of it is taken away or only the storage part.
He is tired of Sky Sport F1.
Halo love F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality of the German Sky has decreased, so that he wanted to make a little noise with this post.
For the first time, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 coverage to begin.
However, due to the delayed start and the start accident, the time plan was far behind the planning, but the last ( planned ) ten minutes as well as the championship decision could still be shown.
Apparently, from a legal point of view, F1 has priority and as a result, all other broadcasts are restricted, which means that Sky Germany had no choice in the matter.
Despite the fact that Sky UK did not broadcast the race in its entirety.
Despite this, a small praise from the commentator Olivier Zwartyes, who has followed the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then, there was once again a lack of knowledge among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as they did not know that, under a red flag, the change of the wheels is allowed.
Although the situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone in the year 2012 had already occurred, it was not until then that both agreed that Verstappen could change his shoes.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately realized that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
He is of the opinion that such basic rules should be known when commenting on the F1 on a pay- TV channel.
It is also not the first Rätselrate that is now possible or allowed according to the regulations,, both of which have ongoing uncertainty in the matter of regulations.
In general, Roos' artificial commentary style is not liked, but that it is a matter of taste.
But even Heiko Water from RTL is better.
In addition, there are constant silliness, which are simply unprofessional and which, like the purchase of coffee by reporter Peter Hardenacke and " UuuuuHD " by Ralf Schumacher, are simply unprofessional.
In particular, the latter brings total chaos in the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
In addition, the advertising has taken over completely at Sky, in the final round, Sky is the only channel that broadcasts the advertisement without commentary directly after the race.
Weder ServusTV or ORF do this.
Both of these channels have less advertising in their training programmes than Sky, which is a Free TV channel.
However, Glock and Baumgartner deserve praise for their work, but this alone is not enough to overcome the shortcomings.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programme is also very thin and full of repeats.
As a whole, Sky is the worst German--speaking channel to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, RTL has made a better job of the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
In other words, the grandiose F1 season is significantly less enjoyable than it would have been with a proper broadcaster.
Mich would like to know their opinion.

The pumps are strong enough to power entire facilities..
Owners of large aquariums tend to use pumps with two or more outflows, to allow more outflows to be connected.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model of the air pump,, but also air curtains ( available in the shop ) or decorations that transform the air bubbles into a function.
There was a treasure chest, a shell or something similar.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction, which makes for low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The blower fan is connected by an air tube 4 to 6 millimeters to an Austrofan or similar, and then it can be activated.
The wind pump was to be the same height or higher than the water level and to be placed outside.
The blower pump is placed lower than the water level and a backflow valve is placed between them.
The air tube was simply cut through and the vent was placed in the middle.
This would be prevented when the water flows backward, the water from the basin flows through the pump.
If the windmill was to be placed in the open,, it was to be covered and protected from moisture like other windmills.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power units that consume little energy.
Even though in eBay the processing time is stated as 3 days, they are packed every day and the packages are taken away every day.
Läuft underway everything goes well, it goes very fast.
They only want to be a little more careful, so that no one is upset, only because it lasted a little longer than expected.
It would be so that not everyone has understanding for the entire employees, who also work in the transport industry. but there is no break in the transport industry.
He should not be judged too harshly, only because the delivery has been delayed, which is solely the responsibility of the transport services.
He complains about the Dienes quite often, even though they say that they have it very difficult at the moment.

Under a blazingly blue sky, Baeos personally welcomed the newly returned astronauts upon their return.
" Welcome back, he said in a blue spacesuit as he opened the capsule door.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers one after the other climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds in flight and reached a height of 10,700 meters.
The 74 year old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923 - 1998 , after which the rocket system of Blue Origin was named , and the 50 year old TV host Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets. Aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick and technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
The amount they paid for their tickets was not revealed by Blue Origin.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminisced after the short flight about the mission of her father.
He had worked hard on his assignments and had to do all the work on his own.
She was just so happy, said the 74-year old with a laugh.
Also Michael Strahan expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to go back to the All again, said the moderator.
" New Shepard " flies up to 100 kilometers.
The rocket system " New Shepard " flies mostly autonomously.
During the flight of the rocket, the capsule separated and reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times experiencing weightlessness before being gently landed by large parachutes.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between the Earth and the sky, but there is no definitive international regulation.
It was the third manned All All flight of Blue Origin. In the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board together with his brother Mark, an 82 year old former US pilot and an 18 year old Norwegian.
At the second in October, the 90-year old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became famous for his role as " Captain Kirk " in " Star Trek " and the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing a business venture with little scientific research interest for the benefit of humanity and with little regard for the climate.
With a flick of the finger, he decides whether his " Smart Stone " will remain permanently in one color or display its entire color spectrum.
On Farbwechsel, the Leuchtstein has a light color for around one minute, before gradually changing to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the " Smart Stone " light beacons has survived for more than 100 years in the open air.
In snowy surroundings, its light is particularly good, with only a slight decrease in the duration of the day.
In the winter, he only focuses on the fact that the snow does not affect the function of the solar module.
" Smart Stone " uses a NiMh battery in a Mignon ( " AA " - format, which can be changed easily.
A suitable replacement battery can be obtained from their webshop, thus prolonging the use of their Dekoleuchte.

Perfectly,, he is a good man, he needs nothing other than this..
They only need the tracking number on his mail.
A person who works or studies in the field of biochemistry.
He is currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and finds the subject itself interesting and is not distracted by the laboratory ( he has already completed the organic chemistry practicum.
He had already been informed about his career prospects prior to the start of his studies,, but he still thought that he would be able to complete his studies and graduate.
Momentan, however,, there are doubts, in particular the career prospects.
On the one side ( Studycheck etc ) it is said that the job opportunities are very good and the job is very sought after, and on the other side it is said that there are unemployed biologists and poorly paid jobs.
From there, he would have been interested.
1) As they are currently working on.
They were satisfied with their work and salary.
3 They have studied and they have been trained.
4 "I would like to do it all over again. "
Many thanks for their responses.
He is currently unsure and is considering ending his studies in 2022 to pursue a career as a computer scientist.
Falls she has had an experience, she also likes to write about it..
Extra stress before vacation and holiday weekends.
This topic came up last week with him.
He had to now use his long weekend to relax from it.
Therefore, only now a post was added.
Not only during the large holidays,, such as the Christmas holidays,, there is great stress in the company.
It seems that there are also strikes and holidays before the holidays..
In fact, it was so that last week was the Assumption of the Virgin, known in Switzerland as " Auffahrt " .
On Friday, the majority of the people and businesses make a bridge day, which is semi- official.
There was a long 4- day weekend in the house last week.
Was also went in the last week.
Overall Stress.
Loud E--Mails that had to be sent out before the start of the long weekend. all of them had to be sent out before the start of the long weekend.
Because of this,, because of that, because of this, because of that, because of this, because of that, because of this, because of that, because of this, because of that, because of this, because of that, because of this, because of that, because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that , because of this , because of that
Because " in the next week then " after so much time sounds and this is not allowed.
or because the people are all serious in a shortened week and want to achieve as much as in a normal week.
He was not only stressed on the 12th, but also very aggravated.
It's a self--imprisonment because of the holidays.
They still have Feast days,, but they are not celebrated properly.
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent.
His question is simply that the Swiss are the only ones who can do it.
This is the reformed evangelical style.
It is also known in the north.
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thüringen.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42 years old) is happy to celebrate Christmas in her Thuringian homeland, but has no gifts yet.
"The Beautiful, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, would fly to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest. said the actress and singer of Hit Radio FFH.
She would participate in the festival with her son by making plates and sculptures.
"I love it, Catterfeld said.
Untill the festive days,, however,, she still has a number of tasks to complete. " Firstly, she has not yet received any gifts, she must now finally finish them.
Nekton Bio facilitates the smooth running of the Mauser and the feather renewal.
Nekton Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, mineral and trace elements and 200,000 µg of biotin per kilogram.
Nekton Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of the wing injuries occurring in the aviary are due to feeding errors.
Since the feathers are made of protein, a particularly rich and balanced protein feeding of the birds is necessary for the formation of an unblemished feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the Mauser phenomenon are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and mineral substances.
In the composition of Nektoton Bio, the disadvantageous proportion of amino acids in most plant--based fodder is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of Nektoton B, no other vitamin preparation was given.
Nekton Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be added to the drinking water or the soft food.
Vielen Dank, he has found it.
It still doesn't work.

A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle ( Saale ) and has been rebuilt.
The German Reichsbahn Society had the AEG commissioned in 1924 to produce proposals for an electric locomotive capable of carrying 2,200 tons of coal and 530 tons of passengers at a speed of 45 miles per hour.
The maximum speed was 65 km / h.
The DRG decided in March 1926 to deliver the locomotive as a 1- Co + Co 1 locomotive with AEG Tatzlager with the delivery of the mechanical parts to the Siemens- Schuckertwerke with the delivery of the electrical parts.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operational numbers E 95 01 – 06.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the later Soviet Union again.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparation goods to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesseration work in Dessau, the workability of all six locomotives was confirmed.
With the increasing electrification of the middle German network, a growing demand for locomotives for the heavy freight train service led to the rebuilding of the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03, with the other locomotives serving as replacement parts suppliers.
The first batches of E 04, E 44 and E 94 were prioritized.
It was not until the E 94 was decommissioned that it became clear that the number of upgrades could not be further increased, at which time the E 95 became the focus of the upgrade.
The locomotives were initially stationed at the Bahnbetriebswerk Leipzig- Wahren.
They came to the Bahnbetriebswerk Halle P. in 1960.
They were used in a separate circulation plan mostly for coal trains from the Geiseltal heading towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated steering of the locomotives proved problematic.
It happened more often that the shooter was left on the scene of the shooting.
Dann, the man on the locomotive had to constantly accompany the Beimann with a hammer and an axe, the shooter during the journey.
Damage to the steam engines occurred more frequently and led to months- long breakdowns of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new locomotives were available and a significant expansion of the electric fleet was not planned at the time, so that the E 95 were withdrawn from service.
They added that the Deutsche Reichsbahn Elektrolokomotives only wanted to operate with one--man crews because of difficulties with the machinery and visibility from the pilot's cabin.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid 1969, the E 95 01 was withdrawn on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was never used.
Until the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 replaced the future Museumslokomotive E 77 10 as a Weichenheizanlage on the main railway station in Halle.
It took a long time to convince the authorities at the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was worthy of preservation as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initially external renovation of the locomotive began with the goal of being able to present it in the RAW Dessau as a showpiece.
The locomotive belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum in Dresden as a non- operational museum locomotive since 1959.
1986 the interior of the locomotive was completed.
In the Halle ( Saale ) railway museum, the locomotive is preserved.
Since 1995, Mitarbeiter of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational rehabilitation of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the Lokomotive could be exhibited for the first time at the Museums BW in Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintings being presented, while the transformers were overhauled and five steam engines were operational.
The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Silesian Mountains Railway and the branch lines, where they proved to be reliable due to their low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the aircraft were transferred to the Mitteldeutsche Network in Leipzig.
Haupteinsatzgebiet was initially Schlesien.
The H0 Handarbeits model in OVP, with a good function, it is covered with dust and has play marks and a musty smell. It is a very rare Handarbeits model, with a very small edition and may have come from the small series firm Zschutschke and Bachmann.

A house fire with two lightly injured and significant damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a house in Oberbayern.
In addition, a considerable damage in the six- million Euro range occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport on the adjacent house in Kinsau ( Landkreis Landsberg am Lech ) .
Two residents were said to have been taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not rule out an intentionally set fire.
The Kripo of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
The comes then much later on.
And he has to pay the transport costs again.
To discredit Fake News, Biontech CEo publishes an AIDs photo.
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in 2021 on the social network " Linkedin " .
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously spoken publicly about his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur released a photo of his coronavirus infection.
The illness of a friend has led him to do so, said Şahin.
The CEo and co---ounder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin has released a photo showing that he has received an infection against the Coronavirus.
In the social media, there were false reports that he had not been vaccinated.
In fact, his wife and he have received three doses of the Biontech- Pfizer vaccine. he wrote on Friday in an article in the network " Linkedin " .
" For several months, friends have been urging him to post a photo of him being injected to counter the false rumors.
He had previously rejected it because it was not about him personally.
But an appeal in the previous week changed his opinion: "He was deeply disturbed when he learned that an old school friend of his was fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe case of the disease and has been hanging on a respirator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, appears to be fear, which is often caused by misinformation and mistrust. "
It is difficult for fear to deal with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In the Internet, circulated an interview with the German Wave, in which Uğur Şahin said that he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as well as the German Welle itself clarified.
"The law does not allow him to get the vaccine himself at this time. " Şahin said at the time.
There is a priority in the distribution of the vaccines in Germany.
In the meantime, the priority has been withdrawn - and the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
Thousands of people without electricity due to a fire in the power plant.
In several municipalities in North Rhine- Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening, no electricity and in many cases also no heating.
A fire brigade station was shut down.
After a fire with severe damage to an emergency station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine- Saar region of North Rhine- Westphalia had to be without electricity for 24 hours.
Due to the fire on Friday evening, 41,000 inhabitants and inhabitants were left without electricity in several communities.
Westnet reported that on Saturday, many emergency power plants were in operation until the large-- scale disruption was finally resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and members of the THW provided assistance in the communes.
The authorities offered shelter in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The Versorger thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
They are aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
They also thanked the affected municipalities, the county, the fire brigades and the THW for their unremitting efforts.
The repair of the damage would still take several days, as the Westnet workers initially only provisorily reopened some of the lines. he said.
A technical defect led to the fire.
The water flows again.
The fire that broke out at 19:15 on Friday has, according to Westnet, destroyed parts of the 10,000 volt switching station in Neunkirch- Seelscheid.
Detailed cleaning and repair work was required.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 volt high voltage level was established.
With the help of these bypasses, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 18 hours, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had again received electricity.
An additional 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirch- Seelscheid were gradually added from 21.30.
Since 23.15 hours, also the last ones affected by the fall had been without electricity.
More than 80 workers from Westnet and partner companies were involved in the work.
The authorities had after the establishment of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that the citizens in their neighborhood take care of elderly or lonely people and report to the local fire brigade headquarters when help is needed. " said Landrat Sebastian Schuster ( CDU ) after a crisis meeting.
The main focus was on the inhabitants of old people's homes when it came to the installation and operation of emergency power plants.
In addition, according to Behörden reports, temporary care places were set up in schools for those who were not able to care for themselves or were dependent on medical equipment that required electricity.
A good day.
However, the Decke is out of stock in Germany.
He can buy it there and pay for it in euros.
It concerns the Tagesdecke # PRS Org # in blue and green.
He hopes that they have also had a good day and that they remain healthy.
But he can't put the sub-structure on the table plate.
It is the name of a custom.
There are 3 versions of it.
They wanted plates with a diameter of # Number.
They have a diameter of 155 cm.
Today came his PRS organization,, however, he cannot fit them together and thus shorten them.
He can help him further.
Otherwise, he had to send them back, because they were not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased with a response.
It is actually easier.
Then they make it so.
Send it to him by mail.
The repairs are now complete.
He had already tried this before the Chat.
He had not restarted the EPRS before the purchase.
I will now do it.
An extremely low Gutschrift is almost unacceptable.
They are not in agreement.
Riiber wins the Nordic Combination.
The German Nordic Combiner Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are on the podium at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to give up again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a large lead in the slopes of the Loipe.

He also has to work in between..
In order for the paint to be applied evenly and cleanly, it is necessary to clean the parts with a small amount of soap and water of dust, grease and fingerprints, and to rinse and dry them with clear water.
Before painting the first time with a new color on the model, it is suggested that 2 to 3 strokes are practiced.
He can be seen on the inside of the building or on a yoghurt bowl.
The first stroke on the building.
He draws the pencil evenly, stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers causes a uniform surface later.
Avoid rapid back and forth strokes with the pencil.
As a result, unrealistic areas are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Begin with the bright colors.
The dark ones could later become visible.
The metallic tones and metallic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unpleasant metallic streaks when they are mixed with normal colors.
Lasse the painted parts dry for a day before he burned them.
The original appearance of the models is achieved by the decals or the abziehbilder.
From the markings on aircraft to the ship's names to the decorations on model aircraft, the decals give the model the final polish.
Bringing the decals in the correct sequence while the parts are still reachable.
The cockpit of a plane allows itself or is easier to be attached to the fuselage before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the correct tools such as scissors, tweezes and razor blades are patience and a steady hand at the time of gluing.
Schneide each of the necessary decals individually and arranged them accordingly.
Decals are also known as "Waterslide paintings" because their backside is covered with water for a short time until the carrier paper turns dark.
Then he moves the picture a small distance from the paper and places it on the corresponding place on the model ( which he had previously moistened ) .
While the Decal is attached to the model with a tool, it is pulled away from the side.
Attention is paid to the fact that the image is correctly placed before it is completely removed from the paper, so that it does not stick to the fingers, wrinkle or tear.
Excess water with a housewife's apron.

The lamp came in 3 separate packages to him.
Despite this, many thanks.
Then, he would go to another place to buy it when the money was returned.
I can get it back without a problem.
Childbirth prevention at PKV and the meaning of " a " Versicherungsfall "
Hallo together.
They had been in custody for some time in the custody of the Children's Welfare Board, and now, when the issue of the compensation from the PKV is at stake, they are suddenly opposed to it.
The Reihe after.
They had applied for the Children's Welfare Program at the PKV beforehand and received the approval for 3 trials.
The experiments were not restricted in any way ( e.g. time frame, success, etc. )
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was compensated by the PKV.
A few years later, they attempted to have a second child,, and underwent two ( unsuccessful ) attempts, which were not counted as part of the PKV.
They applied again for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After several more attempts ( more attempts were made than agreed upon and logically the most expensive ones were reimbursed by the PKV ) the reimbursement was made to the PKV and they received the disappointing news that instead of 5 attempts ( 2 and 3 ) only 3 attempts were to be reimbursed.
The Begroundation is that with the pregnancy and birth, the other two attempts of the first promise fail.
The second Children's Wish was a new case.
According to the AGB, the accident begins with the treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists.
The questions to the experts in the round here.
The one who has the right is the PKV ( only 3 attempts are reimbursed ) or they ( there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed ).
If the PKV had been required to announce that with the birth of a child, all further attempts would fail.
The desire for a second child is a new cause of concern.
The unfruitfulness ( caused by blocked sperm channels ) is not healed by the first child.
It would have been super if the experts there gave their opinion.
Many thanks for the first time for their help.
Can he give him the three variants by email and he said that he would send them back to him in the best way.
In order.
They are not going to buy any more from them.
When they combine the Umsales of him and his friend # Name ( same address ) they have apparently lost good customers.
They are allowed to pass it on to their manager.
It is not competitive.
The day before, his colleague told him that the reimbursement order had been issued and now he says that he must first send the thing back.
He can't do anything to prevent the commode from being completely destroyed by his arrival.
In the screenshot, the colleague had written.
It is clear and clear that the reimbursement order was issued and he has not received any reimbursement from the PRS organization.
They can tell their manager that they have lost two Stammkunden.
His friend has also ordered various pieces of furniture for their apartment.
The things they are no longer doing.
However, the Defekt did not appear until several months later.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell them as office chairs.
The guarantee of 24 months applies regardless of the manufacturer.
It is not possible for him to obtain another type of packing.
He would dismantle the chest and hand it over to the transport company so that it could be transported.
A good day, he has a question to their series of PRS organs.
These products are advertised with additional Hockern, but they can not be found at them.
They can help.
The theme of the week is the best low budget films.
A low budget film is a film with a low budget. There is no general definition of a low budget film with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say about it.
A low budget film or low budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the Net there are a lot of lists of low budget films,, such as on Letterboxd.
They have interesting representatives of this category.
What attracts them to it.
And what was not liked by them at all.
He is a very good customer of them, he has already set up two houses completely with their furnishings.
Wanted the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, it is now also reliable.
Many thanks.
With friendly greetings.
There is no telephone number, a chat where one has to wait for 30 minutes is not a chat.
However, nothing has changed at the Warte position, he will soon give up again because it did not work there.

" Halber victory " against Belarus with high costs for the European Union.
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can claim a " half victory " in the conflict with the Belarussian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Pressedienst.
According to the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP), the EU has not resolved the conflict.
This stalemate - Belarus does not fully comply with the EU, but the EU feels itself as the winner - is likely to continue for a while more.
Bossong said that the treatment of the people at the border was not in accordance with the European human rights convention.
There is an " increasing normalization of pushbacks " by individual EU governments.
Because the EU as a whole is not opposed to it,, the right to freedom of movement is endangered.
This development weakened the unity of the Union.
"She can not, apparently, break through when a member state is set on its own agenda,, such as Poland, which does not allow the EU border protection agency Frontex to gain access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, with Bossong saying that the agreement on the asylum policy has been hampered because the line " border protection, border protection, border protection " has been strengthened.
A second attempt to cross the border.
According to the Polish Border Guard, migrants have again attempted to cross into Polish territory from Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested and returned to the border on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were attacked by the migrants with stones near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard recorded 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday night, a group of 28 migrants overcame the border fence.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the previous months.
The EU is throwing out Alexander Lukaschenko as the dictator in Minsk, with the intention of allowing him to enter the EU.
Poland and Lithuania closed border crossings according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened the airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travel to the countries of origin of the migrants in order to prevent their return.
The most effective element of the EU's reaction was the pressure on the airlines.

In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the telescope should be placed as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic and achromatic designed lens system allows them to use the telescope in a practically error-- free way up to the edge of the field of view.
Frequently, lupes with magnification indications are marked.
However, these figures apply only to exact fixed conditions, which seldom correspond to the use conditions.
In order to be able to use the telescope to its full potential, they were asked to take into account the indications in the table " Technical characteristics " ( see the instructions in the packaging ) .
On the surface of the lens of all optical devices – also on lupes – there are light reflections.
Through the use of an antireflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
In the optimal use conditions, the reflection on the lens surface is less noticeable when the lens is close to the eye.
There are other indications in the accompanying instruction manual ( in German and English ) .

The P.R.S. Organization's team.

Problems with Fibre and Devolo DLan or Magic.
They have had a new glass fibre connection in the house for a few weeks.
However, he has problems with building a stable WiFi network.
Previously, he had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used the Devolo DLan system, which until a few incidents was flawless 50 Mbit transmission and reception.
The new fiber-aschluss sends 500 Mbit to the Fritzbox 7590 and the DLan module attached to the Fritzbox.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the WiFi, transmits less than the full 500, but as he moves closer to the house with the module, the amount of WiFi decreases ( i.e. a socket is used, which is 1, 2 or 3 rooms away from the other module.
This leads to the Internet with the new Glasfaser connection now being slower than before ( ~ 45 Mbit ).
He also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLAN, but there were also large losses.
It is hard to explain why with fibre-optics so much internet speed is lost on the Stromleitung.
And LAN is the only solution.
It would have been extremely expensive to lay the LAN cable in the house.
He is really frustrated that he is not able to get an extra account..
Therefore, he would have been more pleased to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the Giroconto.
He who thought that the Girokonten would be at peace, sees himself disappointed.
During the autumn, many banks have used the autumn to get money from their customers by raising their fees again, and to confirm the negative discounts of the past by reducing the freebet rates. The negative discounts have also been reduced.
The German Bank, for example, had a ceiling of 100,000 euros for a long time.
She has cut the freedom allowance in half and quadrupled the daily allowance.
In the first step, the border was lowered only for customers of the Postbank's conglomerate - to 50,000 euros for Giro and Anlage, and 25,000 euros for Tagesgeld.
In the meantime, the lower Freibetraques for the entire German Bank were confirmed by a spokesman on request.
and not only for new contracts, but also for " new individual agreements with existing customers.
The Commerzbank was already down to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at the Inge Germany.
The low--cost DKB, which is popular with cost conscious customers, has lowered the freebet in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros and then to 25,000 euros.
In total, more than 100 banks have a freebet of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Even the Sparda Bank of Berlin has reached 25,000 euros. However, there is still a legal dispute with the Consumer Protection Association, which won the case in the first instance at the Berlin Land Court.
In the banks, it has been discussed for a long time whether the institutions should be able to re-establish themselves, in the event that the upper authorities declare the negative discounts in principle as unacceptable and millions of bank customers have to be reimbursed.

The people who questioned him had no idea what his medical condition was, why he was unable to play.

He is 24 years old, is a full--time student and a mother of a dog - even though the dog does not scream or goes to the kindergarten, he is, in fact, 1 to 1 his child.
His friend, with whom he has been together since 1968, is ill, suffered a second- degree burn on the 24th and has been depressed for years ( but is now in therapy ) .
He visited him the day before because he also had emotional needs and because he wanted to hug and kiss him, they kissed and hugged a lot.
He helped him in the shower ( because his hand is in a band due to burns )
He is also cold and they see him less ( once or twice a week ) and this makes it difficult for him to fulfill his needs for affection and love.
His puppy has a stomach ache, he has been fed and now lies in his cushion bed and has been somewhat relaxed after being fed with a heat lamp and stroked by him.
He lives alone with his sister and his mother, who is away for a month.
Now, they also have to do housework, which they divide between them.

He is really unendibly grateful that he can't express in words.
He does not know whether he has survived the rest of his kptbs.

In the school, it was established that many of the religion teachers do not believe in God and that it is only a further subject like mathematics or geography.
For him, it was always a bit strange, perhaps also because he was raised as a Christian and he always believed in something.
As to this.
Perhaps he can also tell the story to his colleagues from work or study with different perspectives.
In general, he understands the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate them.
It also has a curriculum.
He also found it strange that a physics professor who did not believe in the theory of relativity.
The reason for wanting to teach religion is that he does not believe in it.
Culture or something like that.
The question is not about privacy.
Kann it not be changed or not. He writes in English, which he also understands well.

There is a Verschlusshaken made of metal in the closure of the Verschlussklappe, with a corresponding anchor beam on the front side of the rucksack.
Unlike most rucksacks, Peak Design has designed it with several " filling positions " in which there are four anchor bars that are firmly riveted and in which the closure hinge is hooked.
When the rucksack is fully loaded, he takes the highest pole, when it is less loaded, he takes a lower pole.
The Klappenverschluss and Haken are also magnetic.
The rucksack can also be closed reliably without the hook being inserted.
The second possibility distinguishes the Everyday Backpack significantly from other backpacks. In addition to the hood, there are two openings on both sides of the backpack.
The elimination of the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from the top - he must no longer have to rummage through the contents.
At the same time, this clever detail increases the all--round usability of the rucksacks enormously. When, in addition to his photography equipment, he also carries everyday objects or travel equipment.
In the Everyday Backpack, the interior can be individually configured (more below) and both of them can be separated from each other without a problem, and through the two side openings as well.
He can also move the rucksack from the right side to the front of his body to reach the camera equipment in the right main compartment while the everyday things stay in the left half of the rucksack.
Comfortable and uncomplicated adjustable straps help.
And because the outside of the rucksack is made from 100 % recycelled and weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even when travelling to Scotland in the autumn.

Coloma is the city where an unanticipated event changed the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered a glowing rock in the waters of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, it spread quickly and led to the so-called " California Gold Rush " of 1849.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were erected and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Each wanted his share in the wealth of the country.
For many, it was " Coloma or Bankruptcy "
In this game, he is a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
He is going to search for gold, to recruit workers, to gather horses and to build a company.
He will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding river flows and surrounding areas.
He is not alone - the other pioneers have apparently the same idea.
He must outperform his Pioneer comrades in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to victory.
They vote simultaneously for their actions, have to manage their resources and build a tableau, which more and more works for them ( so--called " engine building " ) .
The buildings on his tableau allow him to become more efficient, gain additional actions or turn the tide in his favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, he can develop his individual playing style with the help of minor adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 ( the year in which the gold in Coloma was discovered ) to 1850 ( the year in which California became an official state.
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the map where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate positions.
When a Standort has the most Pioneers, it receives a Sperre.
This deactivated the first half of the site, reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players alternately perform actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up camps, crossing rivers, building bridges, opening businesses and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions have been completed, the Pioneers return.
The Anpreiser turns at the beginning of each round to a new location, thereby changing the available actions.
This goes on until the Anpreiser has moved five times and has covered each position once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the player Coloma must defend against an attacking band of bandits.
When the player has enough Revolverhelden and the bandits are numerically superior, they receive rewards.
When they fail, they receive smaller rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is announced.
The player with the most points wins.

Former patients and caregivers have now made serious accusations against him.
The film is difficult to watch.
And he is very grateful that many people nowadays think differently and act differently.
The parents and other responsible persons can never, never, never have power over the child.
Their goal must always be to give the child freedom for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is appropriate and possible in the situation.
He is still shaking..

What this is due to.
What he describes is called " awareness " and also sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
They occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common is the hearing of sounds, voices, the rarest is the seeing of pictures and the least common is the feeling of pain.
For this topic relevant, the Kaiserschnitte is an operation that is associated with an increased rate of awareness, because the child is protected from birth until the abnabeling with a very deep anesthesia.
Previous episodes of Awareness must be mentioned in the pre--trial hearing.
Certain anesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) are associated with a slight increase in risk.
This comment from him describes Awareness accurately,, although it did not have any effect.
He has misinterpreted his comment.
The chair is, however, defective.
The 20 euros are also not enough.

The " Drive " of a Röhren endstufe plays a major role in the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sounds.
These characteristics have been perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor Schaltung.
With the Volume, Gain and Master Volume Regulators, they can, on the one hand, achieve the desired volume and on the other hand, the amount of distortion in their sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT + series have a unique power level regulator, which allows the sound level to be reduced without affecting the gain and distortion.
In addition, it was stated that with the Power Level Regulator, it was possible to make a power reserve available, when the sound becomes unbearably loud.
Thanks to the Power Level Regulator, the entire potential of the VT + series can be used in every situation.
The Kopfhörerbuchse can also be used as a line out.
The accompanying signal is, in fact, simulated with a box, so that even with the use of headphones or direct recordings, an eminent " acoustic " sound effect is achieved.

A tuner is also on board, so they do not need a separate tuning instrument.
If he is also given a VFS5 Footstarter, he can call the sounds with his feet, switch the effect blocks in and out, and change the tempo of the correspondingly compatible effects.
For the live performance, this is, in fact, indispensable.

8 euro return fee is in his eyes an injustice.
It is time for change.
He was greeted by the German Parliament and was welcomed in the plenary chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day.
The purpose of the Post here.
When one looks at the activity of the German Parliament in the past months, it can be seen that it is not existent.
They are in a winter slump and have extended the summer gap for several months.
Where the problem lies.
That is the reason for it.
For the most part, it is due to the dissatisfaction, as some things have been disrupted and the general mood is sour.
In the last days, the impression has become more pronounced that many still have a strong desire to participate in the Bundestag.
#The changes they have to make.
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is called upon to maintain it.
The initiative came from U and Edizvevo, who had become aware of the project in the last days and found a heap of rubble.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, he also wants to call on everyone to participate in the project again, to ensure that it can continue to exist in the future.
They have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which they can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
The server can be joined through this link.
Goals.
How the MBundestag will function in the future.
The existing orders must be changed or adapted or removed.
As to how they would appear in the future.
The new members are to be recruited.
= They are trying to create a fair election system.
He is quite certain that he has forgotten some things, which is not serious,, but the end of the discord.
When their desire and time permits, they come to the Discord to work with and decide the future democratically.
He has also ordered a lamp shield from them, which has not yet been delivered.
Now, he sees that the article is too large and bulky for him and that it is not suitable for his taste.
For this reason, he had already ordered another one from them.
He put it together and noticed it then, when he took the soft cream.
It is very sad about it.
He hopes that this will be returned and that he has a full reimbursement.
This is also somewhat sad, because the name is much darker than expected.
He also has a question: the Tagesdecke # PRS Org. is also available in a larger size, 240 x 240, for example.
PRS must ensure that the faulty shaft is removed as soon as possible.
and he begged her to arrange it.
A suitable packing has not been found, the shelf will be dismantled as far as possible for the removal - it is necessary to negotiate with the Prussian Museum.

First of all, he thanked him for the fact that he did the whole thing, he has also spent almost a decade in the State Service in a similar role and he was also a weapon bearer in the Executive, and he did not want to engage in it.
The question of rights and wrongs is always presented in a very simplistic way.
In general, it should be said that the Statesman comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary Left,, which would have been clear to everyone.
Naturally, also in the special uniform and weapon carriers, people on the right of the conservative magical side should also have been clear that these people, then, naturally, with the lived reality would have been hard to deal with. Naturally, it is also clear that there are many Germans with a migrations background, women and homosexuals ( and this means that it is not the exaggerated feminine stereotype of the homosexual, which is found in the executive, but rather normal men and women who are not noticed when they are not described ) and that these people can and must be relied on because in the event of danger they can save their lives or set them in danger.
But even these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, according to his experience, as they are proud of Germany and feel that they have been neglected by overbearing left--wing politics, even though they perceive this politics to be unfavorable to them.
Back to the right, it is natural that the police and the armed forces are also a cross section of society, and that there are extremists on the right who are able to openly express their opinions, or even to make plans that threaten the state, which are overstated in the media and irritate him.
Naturally, it often happens that police officers and soldiers, who were often involved in overseas missions, began to generalize and say things that are controversial and politically incorrect.
It also happens that those with the same ideological convictions meet and engage in a mutual exchange of ideas.
However, this is the opinion of the majority of the people, and it has also been countered by political education and awareness campaigns.
Germany is so heavily international entangled and this is also a good thing according to his opinion that it is not possible for them to have racists and Nazis in their ranks.

He has an education in the field of software development and has been out of work for about a year.
However, he feels that this profession is not the right one for him, which is why he has been thinking for a long time that he would start again and study social work.

There was also no confirmation for it.
He is waiting for a pick--up time.
They are asking for the return of the goods.

The protein taken in by the bird is broken down in the bird's gastrointestrial tract into the individual amino acids and then rebuilt into the bird 's own protein, which is needed for the formation of the bird 's feathers.
The plumage development of the nestling and the plumage rebuilding of the maturing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a high demand for the entire organism of the animal.
It is necessary to take into account that Nektoton B is not allowed to be distributed during the breeding season because it can cause disruptions in the breeding process.
In the aftermath of the Nekton Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with Nekton S ( a multivitamin preparation ) and Nekton MSA ( a mineral substance preparation ) was resumed.
The protein that the bird eats is broken down in the bird's stomach into the individual amino acids, and then the bird uses these amino acids to build its own proteins, which it also uses to build its feathers.
The plumage development of the nestling and the plumage rebuilding of the maturing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a high demand for the entire organism of the animal.
It is necessary to be aware of the fact that Nekton Bio cannot be distributed during the breeding season because it can cause disruptions in the breeding process.
In the aftermath of the Nekton Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with Nekton S ( a multivitamin preparation ) and Nekton MSA ( a mineral substance preparation ) was resumed.
1 gram of Nectron Bio on 250 milliliters of water or 100 grams of soft food.
It was suggested that only so much drinking water and soft food was to be prepared, and that the water and food was to be changed daily.
A stained messlöffel ( inliegend ) is equivalent to 1 gram of neutron bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, the double or triple dosage of Nectron Bio can be given at the beginning, until the formation of new feathers is visible.
After that, the normal dosage is given until the new feathers are fully formed.
Lagering of Nekton Bio should be done in dry conditions without sunlight, between 15 ° and 25 ° C.
He must apologize to them, but the chair is sold as a bureaucrat's chair.
As a result of 9 months of use, a desk chair can be destroyed.
The guarantees in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Halo, he sent an email on Monday to announce that his shipment was damaged and pictures were attached.
They have received this email.
The statement of a member of the community in opposition to the statute.
Hallo r - Legaladvice.
He has the following problems.
On their property, a walnut tree is to be felled.
Also a complaint was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to him that the cases of fruit trees and consequently the walnut are not part of the statute.
In the statute, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a tree to be protected.
He can now rely on the statements of the employees or not.
On the other side, he must rely on the opinion of an expert.
On the other hand, the Statute is unambiguous.
I thanked for their responses.
The understanding they have.
Dann, the new packaging will be used.
He has not received any news.
Then, he still has a sofa without use.
He could have given her a legacy or a gift.
They were more expensive.

They can be tested.
Eilmelding about a severe traffic accident in Selb.
A heavy traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Anschlussstelle Selb- Nord and Plößberg.
According to the police's Pressealarm ( 14:03 Uhr ), a Pkw collided with a vehicle in the opposite direction while overtaking.
There are injured.
Ah okay understands.
Good, then many thanks that it went so smoothly.
Advice and ideas for further career.
First happy Christmas for them.
My Christmas is rather poor,, because his beloved head has been ruined by everything that can be ruined.
Before he now leaves the country, he needs advice from people who know his situation, i.e. from them.
He is currently doing the Ref as a rookie..
Originally, he studied in a different field and worked in a related field ( to remain anonymous, he does not name it more specifically).
The whole was then too boring and he then looked for alternatives that made him more fun.
At some point, he landed in the ministry and was sure that this was the right place for him, even though the conditions were less flexible than in his previous job.
He is now at the third " he googles other positions " .
And it is only half a year since.
In the past, he has always decided to continue and finish the Ref, after which he can still change direction.
However, he is completely exhausted.
He had the last month so little free time that he was completely exhausted.
Although there are holidays, there is still a lot of work waiting for him.
Before the Ref, he always thought he was stress resistant, but his weekend was also his weekend and his evening was also his evening.
He had free time.
and the stress on the job was the same in the moment.
The family celebration has become too much of a burden for him.
And then, there are these rigid structures that annoy him even more.
In general, it is fun and from the outside, the Ref runs well, the feedback is good.
But he is completely exhausted and he is wondering how much stress his body can withstand before it completely breaks down - if it is not already broken down.
He wonders whether he wants to spend the rest of his working life in this way,, especially when he reads some of their contributions,, or whether he should return to the area where he was most respected,, where he could take time off when he needed it, , and where he was paid fairly for the work he was doing in a team rather than as a lone fighter , and where he was paid fairly for the work he was doing in a team rather than as a lone fighter .
But then, he questions whether he is still in the same place as he is now and unhappy.
They notice that it is all a mess, but they may have ideas or ideas from this situation, that she is completely exhausted and begins to cry at the smallest thought of it.
Decisions are now being made in a more emotional way, this is likely to lead to nothing good.
However, their views may help to see a little light at the end of the tunnels, or to be able to enjoy Christmas for the first time.
Danke for the reading and apologized for the whining tone of his voice.
He hopes that his situation has become somewhat clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of Vox has been steadily developed, which included the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the " Valve Reactor " control system, which perfectly reproduces the behaviour of a trombone.
With the VT20x, the VT40x and the VT100x Amps, they have created a brand new modeling engine that in terms of sound is on the latest state of technology.
Thanks to the Vet Technology ( Virtual Element Technology ) based on the analysis of the parts and amplifier arrangements, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These Amps also contain the more advanced Valvetronix preamplifiers.
This is partly based on real analog switches because these give the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated arrangement, the VTX amplifier has a closed chamber and a bass-reflection system, from which the natural resonances only sprout.
With the " Tone Room " software of Vox, they can recreate historical facts on the virtual level, even correcting and altering the sound of the amplifier and the effects so that they sound as they have always imagined.
The perfect combination of Röhren sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 presented Vox Valve Reactor technology.
This was subsequently improved several times to accommodate new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the Vox Valvetronix Series in 2010, with more dynamism and a number of new and decisive amplification models.
From the handy VT 20 + to the VT 120 + with two speakers, the new VT + Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists on the hunt for a maximum variety of sound were found.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamism of a tube amplifier. They expect a thick sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and the sound of the strings, and a prompt response.
During an initial analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that in particular the end stage of the amplifier was characterized by the sound of a reactor, and on this basis they developed the Vox Valve Reactor technology.
The with a 12AX7 Röhre best-ucked Valve Reactor Schaltung of each VT + Verstärkers forms the behavior of the subtle nuances and the sound character of the Röhrenverstärkers perfectly.
NBA, despite 20 points from Wagner, the Magic lost to the Clippers.
The defeat series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but the victory over the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104-106.
The large main compartment is also adjustable, with three individually placed and foldable Klett closure parts that allow it to accommodate all types of cameras, from spiegelless system cameras of all sizes up to full--format spiegelreflex cameras.
In the end, the size of the camera and the lens determines what can be carried in the rucksack.
A possible armament would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a spotlight.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony A7 series or the Fuji XT2 still have room for additional lenses.
In addition, one can also store a lot of additional equipment.
And if he has a small DSLM camera ( MFT cameras from Olympus and Fujifilm X or E series ) he can use the backpack for his equipment and for other things.
Even the drone pilots choose the Everyday Backpack 20L as the optimal choice, because the rucksack has enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including the remote control and equipment.
A volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma, one of the longest in history.
In the short three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the island of the Canaries have caused great damage.
There is an end in sight.
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
Previously, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585, which lasted for 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable records of previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past days, but vulcanologists did not predict when it would end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable " said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state television channel RTVE.
Losses in millions of dollars.
In the three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees Celsius hot lava has destroyed more than 2,900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
It covers almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 inhabitants were evacuated and the damage is estimated to be more than 90 million euros.
Before the coast, two new islands were formed by eroded lava with an area of approximately 50 hectares.
The banana plantation, which is the island's most important source of income, was severely affected, with about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly living on it and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely damaged, the newspaper " El País " wrote.
Christmas and the gifts.
Christmas is on the doorstep and especially the children are not able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension to have a seductive effect.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still unite the increasingly divided society.
The most important thing is to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French anthropologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, has been a " peace treaty between primitive peoples " becomes alive again in the context of the tradition.
As from Nikolaus, the Christchild became.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants, through whom the Christmas days were associated with the celebration of the birth of Christ.
Previously, gifts were given on St. Nicholas' Day in various forms.
The background of the still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the tradition of giving gifts to children, especially in Germany, emerged.
Protestants objected to this tradition because they rejected the idea of saints as mediators between God and humans.
From these reasons, they oppose the institution.
Martin Luther transformed the figure of St. Nicholas into the Christchild, thereby establishing a new tradition line.
The focus of the festivities shifted to the Christmas Eve.
Since the majority of Protestants do not see these details as an issue, only the fewest are angered by the fact that the tradition of St. Nicholas, including the singing of the St. Nicholas song and the St. Nicholas procession, is still an integral part of the pre-- Christmas period.
Today, he is found in Stiefelfeld in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to desired luxury watches.
The diversity of traditions in Christian countries.
Sources confirm a tradition of the distribution of goods since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the Feast of St. Nicholas was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, there is a chaos over the issue of who is to give the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it varies from region to region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is a kind of St. Nicholas, acquires some of his own characteristics.
These include, for example, his white Rauschebart, which has little resemblance to the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference of chimneys to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure of the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy, the Witch Hexe Befana gives the way to the Jesuschild.
In Scandinavia, sometimes supernatural beings bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought considerable fame.
There are not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christkind is responsible for the distribution of gifts.

No, this is the case with all books, which is the reason for the demand from the PRS organization,, since it is a general problem.
Scheduling plan ( EK )
Hello dear colleagues and colleagues.
He has been in the RF since summer, he enjoys the training,, but he still has major problems planning his geography studies.
However, his school is technically poorly equipped, so he can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In the school, he can also only copy S and W films, which he finds annoying.
He needs a lot of time to plan his hours.
They are doing, for example, the theme of geofactors, and at his side, he stands almost every hour.
In principle, the methods used are the same, but at the same time, he also wants to spend less time on rehearsals ( which he also spends on UBs and so on ). .
When planning, he usually starts from the goal he wants to achieve, and then decides how he can achieve it ( most of the time he creates a work sheet with texts from books that his school does not have.
They have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, he is not satisfied.
Daher also the work sheets.
Perhaps, he can teach me how to work efficiently with the book.
He would have been delighted.
I would like to return the @ PRS @ Organization @ from the @ Number @ list.
He has already decided on a new job at the PRS organization,, but he would like the return to be completed as quickly as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed to enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and complains of income losses.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations damage the important Christmas trade of the Handelsverbandes Deutschland ( HDE ) .
In transactions with goods of non- daily use, losses were criticized by HDE's head of operations, Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey of 1,100 dealers by the HDE, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative view of the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the high point of the year, is now often a hole without a bottom " said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre- crisis sales in the previous week.
It went well only in the foodstuffs department and in the online area.
The Federation demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with a mask, with a distance and a hygiene concept was a safe affair, said the head of the company.
" 2G at the market does not bring them further in the fight against the pandemic. he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off passengers and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the band regulation would be allowed nationwide.
Thereafter, all customers were only allowed to pass through 2G ( infected or cured ) checkpoints once and were allowed to enter all businesses with the band of that day.
In addition,, in the retail sector,, like previously in the public transport with the 3G rule ( those who have been vaccinated, those who have recovered and those who have been tested ) , stichprove surveys are sufficient.
Even the specialised on shopping centers real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The Frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre--corona levels and the umsales at about 90 percent.
These numbers are now in the middle of the so important Christmas business, the chairman of the board Wilhelm Wellner said to the " Economic Week " .
Due to the high personnel and administrative burden of the Center, solutions were sought and approved.
This also includes the so-called Bändchen solution, in which " the visitors, for example, once at a central location in the center present their 2G evidence and then, equipped with an armband similar to those used in a club hotel, can freely enter all the shops.
He has recently ordered and received the PRS Organization..
The Spiegel has a scratch and the frame also has a flaw, which was covered with a yellow substance.
It looks ugly.
He would like to return the Spiegel and has already put it back into the package and sealed it.
In order to continue the Retour, he must go forward.
The Lampe is designed for Dual Balance based on new, flat SMD - LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp is controlled by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities.
In addition to the adjustment of the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures, daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to adjust the color temperature in the range of 3100 – 5650 K manually and to store it.
They use the current configuration of the flash memory.
A special feature of the controllers is that they are easy and intuitive to use.
The Leuchte produces a very strong light stream with a soft light of high quality, completely free of flickering.
The beam angle of 120 degrees with the ability to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is impressive.
In addition, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
They can adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool both on the film set and in the studio..
The optional available DMX 512 controller allows for the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in a difficult to access location.
On the backside of the Leuchte is the control panel, it consists of switches and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness level in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries ( which are not included in the delivery ) .
The viewer has up to three panels for brightness and color temperature.
To achieve the positioning of the individual positions on the memory plates, it is simply achieved by longer pressing of one of the memory tastes marked and finished.
The lamp controller records the current state of the lamp when it is shut down, so that when it is reopened, the known situation is restored - very practical when, for example, the camera is set to a specific color temperature.
Working with batteries is one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120. this is due to the ability to operate with good NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen ( and women ) - so they can use existing equipment.
The DL 3120 can also be tested before the set, it has a battery tester built in, for each of the two battery compartments there is a score in the two display panels ( the upper one for the upper battery compartment and the lower one for the lower one.
In addition, it is also possible to continuously supply the projector with electricity through the supplied network.
The construction of the projectors is very simple.
They have a 16 mm hinge as an attachment,, which allows them to be attached directly to their photostable.
The inclination is by means of stabilizers on both sides to be reliably set.
It was also emphasized that the mechanical components are extremely high- quality, and as a result, they are designed to be durable and hard to use.
In addition, a Neigegelenk is included in the package.
Grossartig is that the package also contains a bag.
This means that they can transport the Leuchte with all the accessories they want to buy, without any problems.
It is a shame that he has given it away and it is too small.
"The party that they wanted to throw " after the comeback against Leverkusen.
It was a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a row defeated Hessen were apparently on the way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
However, then the SGE turned the game around, scored five goals within a good hour and won fiercely with 5-2. "It's Wahnsinn what the boys have done today, jubilated coach Oliver Glasner at DAZn and spoke a " general praise to all the players who were there.
However, at the beginning of the match, it looked as if it would be another setback for the now ninth- placed Frankfurters, who were behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had the Leverkusener with a 2-0 lead.
What then happened, also impressed the SG coach.
"As the players then returned and a fantastic performance was shown, Glasner continued.
He is extremely happy with the performance they have shown and also with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who returned to the field for the first time since the fourth game and overcame his muscle injury, also emphasized the moral of his teammates.
He believes that the German mentality is unbelievably large, said the 27- year old and was pleased with a glance at the result in particular for the audience.
This was the party that they wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, sees himself, at the same time, in a good position in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that all the players are fit in December, that all the players are physically in a top condition.
It is Top- Work in the medical department, but also the players live high professionally.
He wanted to " step forward step by step and stay modest " and continue the tasks until the end of the year " on this level " .
The next match is scheduled to be played on Wednesday as part of the English Week against Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 Uhr, Sky ) on the schedule.
He received the mail that his package was returned to him due to a mistake on his part.
He has tried to contact the PRS Organization and it turned out that he was not given a chance.
It can be sent directly back to him or it must wait until the money is returned and the order is resubmitted.
In his case, this would mean that he would not be able to order again because it had already been a long time.
They have already been on the board of directors of the PRS..
Dampers for the women's handball team before the quarterfinal against Spain.
Germany's women's handball team walked away from the humiliating defeat against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes on the court.
At the end of the World Championship main round, the DHB selection lost to the Spanish team 16-32 (8-13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers with a heavy defeat and must now face host country Spain in the quarterfinals.
They were too nervous and had too much respect for the opponent, coach Henk Groener judged.
Against Spain, they must appear differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8 - 2 points as second behind the Danes ( 10 – 0 ) .
It is sad that they did not take the flow with them.
It was a bad game for all of them, they had to lose it " said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to qualify for the semi--finals against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on the following day, a significant improvement is needed to keep the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three- times Olympic champion Denmark was the backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"They were not there in the attack or in the defense, defensive player Xenia Smits said, and demanded that " they must now quickly look ahead. "
From front to back, not on the height.
Anders than in the previous five tournament matches, the German team was not on the same level from the start of the match.
Failures and technical errors in the attack and holes in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the job and prevented worse with several saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9 minutes and 30 seconds, when Grijseels completed a quick counterattack.
The expected initial ignition was not achieved.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women were hardly able to get into the scene, and when they did, they often failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game started with a 3-10 deficit after 20 minutes due to an early lead and Mia Zschocke was forced to leave the field due to a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, she can again participate.
Only in the final phase of the first half, the DHB selection started to get into the game, and by the end of the first half they were ahead by five goals.
The only faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes when the score was 9-19.
The Groener Schützlings again sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well--prepared opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the end of the tournament.
As a result, the German team was not able to achieve a performance increase and went as a clear loser from the court.

"It's going on with them. "
The title says that he is a mobile impffer in mobile impfteams, where ( previously only ) the BioNTich and Pfizer impfes are used in care homes.
As these are now almost completely finished, they then go to a part of the immunization centers for further treatment..
He is willing to answer questions without a time limit to the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. " He takes medication X and tolerates it with the immunization. "
In his area of responsibility is the dissemination of the immunization, the indication ( the person has the right to be immunized according to the corona immunization law and there are no grounds against it ), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency treatment of allergic reactions ( which has never occurred ). .
The injection itself is delegated to qualified personnel,, such as medical assistants.
In Impfeteams, they are often lacking an assistant, but " only " ( due to God's will ) pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of the infectious substance, but they are not able to carry out the infectious substances themselves, so that they also carry out most of the infectious substances themselves.
Heavy " Huidlerer " problem, Amberger knows the solution.
This is a " Huidlerer " .
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger,, it has caused a lot of controversy in the BRT television series " We in Bavaria " .
Different from many previous days, the term remained unchanged by the callers.
No, it was a " nervous man ".
and also no one, " who has to move quickly.
The people heard that the TV moderator was completely wrong.
According to the man from Amberg, the man from Amberg, the man from Amberg, the man from Amberg, the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man from Amberg , the man
"The Huidlerer, as seen by the audience, is a Lappen who is wiping the stove. "
Dialektologist Antony Rowley, from the Bavarian Television since years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Bavarian expression, derived from the more well--known dialect word "Houdern.
With the closure of a gap in education, many of those who had lived in the area of Amberg for a long time.
He has been unable to buy books for two weeks.
It comes after the confirmation with the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
He has started the #PRS ' Org ' again, with the PC connected, synchronized and repaired.
There has been no help.
The choice of wheels for the racing horse is actually very safe.
In the morning, he was full of energy because he wanted to train a little for his bicycle tour in the coming week.
Said and done and he drove with his racing bike, which he bought the day before on eBay.
The first 40 km were also beautiful,, but then the same thing occurred in every inner city ( this time in Krefield ) .
Glassplitter on the track.
Zack's loud screams and his rear wheels did not want to participate in the rest of the track.
Due to the fact that on weekdays, he did not have any real possibility of obtaining a replacement jacket and helmet, he had to turn around and take the first available train back home.
It was then also financially not as bad,, perhaps it is also better if he changes the wheels again before the Radtour.
Now, he stands before a question and hopes that they can help him.
As he has a relatively long journey over several days ahead of him, he would not want this problem to occur again.
Now, it was not so bad, because the old wheels from the previous owner ( a very nice old man who came to pick up the bicycle at 14:00 on the same day and had traveled 120 kilometers with them, which were described as suboptimal because he had used them for many years on a roller.
When, however, he thinks that he has to make a change of wheels at a speed of 80 to 90 km/ h, he is really unhappy.
He had a conversation with an older man at the airport who asked him why he did not have the Marathon Plus wheels, which are supposed to be unbreakable.
The whole thing now sounds very tempting.
But they are really so uncapable.
He has little desire to give up 40 euros, only to then be disappointed.
In addition, he is wondering about the 25 x 622 on the running track.
There is also ( apparently ) a wider version of the Marathon Plus Reifen, but the majority is still narrower.
This is a problem.
or they would have her with a racing bicycle in general to other types of bicycle wheels.

After the release of their new high- end broadbanders B 100 - 6 OHms, it was only a matter of time until the Solo Series also received new members.
The new Sprössling is called Solo 15 and resembles the large predecessors with the B 200 – 6 OHm.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable design foot was included, with the loudspeaker being placed in the correct position.
It has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The Solo 15 is well suited for people with a relatively low level of loudness, but with a very high level of sound quality.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the Solo 15 sounds weak.
On the other hand, they grow to an impressive size and for their size they are extremely impressive and accurate.
The Solo 15 was tuned with a slight high tone increase.
This is common among broadband users because the high frequencies are increasingly concentrated in order to optimize.
The Solo 15 is very accurate and has a very clear and fine sound.
The high tone area is reduced and so the sound image is made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the individual components of a musical piece are located in an optimal stereodimensional sharp and precise manner.
The very low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHm are responsible for a similar dynamics.
The Solo 15 complements not only the Solo Series, and enlarges it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of his bassoons, it is necessary to begin thinking about the final sound of the bassoon to make corresponding changes to the construction of the instrument.
In order to make the Gehäuse furnished,, the lowering of the loudspeakers has to be adjusted accordingly, because the furnishing still adds more material.
After all the plates had been cut, they would have a 8 mm hole drilled in the floor at the corresponding place to allow the cable to pass through easily later.
With the help of an upper frase, now the speaker opening in the front is made, so that the B 100 – 6 OHm can be used in the front completely.
From the back, this opening was to be fitted with a 45 degree angle to maximize the size of the loudspeaker chassis.
The four welding points of the B 100 - 6 OHm are broken in the phase as in the image " Detail Fase " shown.
After this, he begins the actual construction of the box and places one of the two sidewalls on a flat surface in front of him.
On these, the rear wall, the roof, the front wall and the floor are cemented.
In addition, the three reinforcements and the reinforcement cement were to be installed and cemented.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in strength depending on whether they are made from 16 mm MDF instead of using ready-made beams from the timber yard.
In the next stage, the second side is attached.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot follow, including the two sides and the front.
By means of a suitable Lochkreissäge or a Forstnerbohrers, the placement of the openings of the bassreflexrohres, as well as the placement of the attachment clamp on the back wall is facilitated.
He then uses a circular saw to round all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the footplate can also be rounded.
In the following, the footplate is firmly attached to the base of the building with wooden screws and additionally with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre--drilling ( 2.5 mm drilling ) of the mounting points of the speaker chassis and the attachment clamp.
After the Gehäuse of wood dust was cleaned, the cable laying began.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm Bassreflex opening in the rear wall.
He then pulls the entire and uncut cable piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, leaving it there for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the opening of the loudspeaker and left there loosely hanging.
Following this, the frequency changer is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the Frequenzweiche, as well as the corresponding attachment plan can be found in the construction manual for the Solo 15.
The frequency switcher was installed and the connection terminal was bolted, followed by the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box, which is not completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with some skill, it is possible to drop Heißkleber onto the opening and thus close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHm and with a small lamp, it is possible to examine the sealing accordingly.
Then follows the damping, according to the description.
Then the B 100 – 6 OHm is connected to the B 100 – 6 OHm and is fastened to the B 100 – 6 OHm with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the positive cable ( marked cables ) at the positive pole of the speakers ( larger contact ) are tied.
At the end, the bassreflector tube is shortened to 28 mm ( the total length of the tube ) and inserted.
The bedämpfing is a matte of the dämpfing material cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening of the bass reflex tunnel should be preserved.
He can also give an order now and begin delivering in June..

Finally, they are able to announce that they will also organize the Oscars again in the year.
It is not possible for unknown reasons to have more than four people in the studio due to the higher planning costs and the short notice of the announcement.
There will be at least three people on the switch, so that the Oscars 2021 would be broadcast with at least 7 people on the switch and thousands of them watching it.
