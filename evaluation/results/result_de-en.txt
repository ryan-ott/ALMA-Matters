He is the #PRS 's largest client and therefore it is not a problem for him.

As long as they are still young enough to be children, he does not see a problem.
When his K1 is alone for a short time and it is OK for him, that is good.
He can himself best assess whether it is suitable for his children.
It is not the case that he wraps the K2 and stays with him for hours until he falls asleep.
Legally, it is questionable.

The story was about fear and how to cure it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself with food and letting his cats into the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a Commissarin who, after a short investigation, comes to the conclusion that the therapist is running a clinic where he treats patients who are suffering from anxiety.
The Commissar has a small niece who also has a fear ( of fire ) and lands at this therapist's place.
There are more suicides and there is a new protagonist, a photographer who is assigned to go to the site of the suicide to document and put the photos on the internet.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the brain that suppresses an anxiety center, and the patients eventually release their anxiety in the most extreme way.
( A woman jumped out of the window and another drove herself to death intentionally )
The situation in which the character is placed is called " the fight " in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital with a fire to do with.
This is the basic plot of the original book written by a French author or authoress.

London - the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the Corona vaccinations against the rapid increase in the numbers of the Omikron strain to go ahead more quickly than originally planned.
Every adult in England would have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that three months had passed since the second impfing.
The original target date was at the end of January.
The British government would also provide additional support to accelerate the campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
He is facing the threat of the Omikron variant, a situation that requires an increase in the vaccination protection, said Johnson.
The good news was that the protective level with a third immunization doses would be re-established.
"It's time for the boosters to step up " said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more cases of the Omicron strain were recorded in the United Kingdom, bringing the total to 3,137.

He is for the idea that everyone should use pronouns.
He has sent a letter of application.
He received the invitation to a meeting by mail.
He wants to respond to the e--mail.
However, the name is not " Peter " but a somewhat more complicated name.
He has been Googled and, depending on his or her cultural background, he or she is either a man or a woman.
I don't know how he should write the e-mail.
I can't do it alone.
He is an immigrant and does not want to have officials walking on his feet.
The conclusion is that each person should present themselves with pronouns.

[CW ) The feeling when he does not help.
The content of the warning is about domestic violence.
I must write something from the soul.
He ( 21 ) is often in contact with the victims ( and perpetrators ) of domestic violence.
A theme that often appears in the media is that many victims are not helped or that they do not want to be helped.
He is quite clear that they are not able to do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in his profession that move him more than when he cannot do anything in such situations.
He sees the blue spots, the blood, the eyes of despair.
But even in conversation with the perpetrator, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing range, it is not possible to reach him.
He does not know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of the children from this to enter.
That he wants to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, that it is possible to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they are not just victims of violence.
Often, he wishes that he could be there in every case to help, but he knows that he is not able to do so.
It becomes easier, but it never becomes easier.
I always thinks about the fact that they are worth living without violence, that is so important.

The Basketball Bundesliga Derby between the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg and the Merlins Crailsheim ended in a disaster for the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg.
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick was untroubled.
For the second time within three months, the Giants lost to Crailsheim - and again.
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick said that the team still had " a bit of resentment " after the defeat of the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in the Pokal in October.

Represented by a statistic, the entire Dilemma is expressed by a 13 percent quota, 4 goals ( all of them from the young Johannes Patrick ) from a total of 31 attempts.
After the victory at Teneriffa, they were not concentrated enough and did not execute what they trained.
Specifically to move the ball.

German Minister of the Interior Klara Geywitz : Through expropriation, no new housing is created.
The new Minister of the Interior, Klara Geywitz ( SPD ) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing conglomerates, as it was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
" With an Enteignment, no new housing is created, it only changes the ownership structure. " Geywitz said in an interview with the " Tagesspiegel " ( Sunday ) .
His goal is to ensure that the rent in the next years remains affordable.
A bizarre mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations, is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Green Party and the Left Party will set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the people's vote.
However, when the situation did not improve, Geywitz was negotiating with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The Coalition Agreement stipulates a Mietpreisbremse until 2029, a limitation of Mieterhöhungen in overcrowded housing markets and the expansion of the Mietspiegels before.
He would meet with the Justice Minister to implement it as soon as possible.
When the rental market does not calm down,, the SPD politician said that she and her coalition partners are discussing further steps.

The pictures from there resemble a war zone.
In the night of Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe damage and possibly hundreds of deaths in the United States.
The storms left an approximately 320 kilometer long swath of destruction, particularly in the state of Kentucky.
Dessen Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, all over where the tornado passed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops and government buildings are simply demolished.
Parts of industrial buildings and roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that it is possible.
He estimates that there are up to 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, the official numbers rise daily.
Halo, he has just seen that the Vitrine # Name # has been sold out.

Companies pay bonuses and change advertising slogans.
While the Federal Government rejects the proposal for an immunization bonus, the companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offer their employees bonuses for the immunization.
They are on the same line with the Social Partners OGB and the Economic Chamber, who today demanded financial incentives for an infection.

Help with the first own campaign.
Boron to the Grusse.
He is currently leading a group of four friends on an adventure over the Greifenpass and wants his heroes to seamlessly enter a story written specifically for the player.
They play DSA 5.
The great arch was made, the villains and their motivations were written, the individual acts were conceived and now he is in the process of writing the opening adventure and has already stumbled over his own feet.
The premise is that the heroes have a wagon with grain from Gratenfels in a small village near the Thuran Sea.
It is to be expected that the further development of the plot will take place.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins await the hero in an ambush.
He wants the player characters to have the ability to solve the confrontation in different ways, by persuasion, action or threat, and to recognize the danger early on.
Group strength 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears and 6 armed with bows and swords.
At Nichtbemerken, the Goblins ambushed the hero in a hollow way and surrounded him with three groups to the left and three groups to the right, armed with bows, while two groups stopped the wagon with spears.
One of them is that the Helden will die, and the other is that the Helden will become a slave.
The heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster,, a halfelf.
The carriage is gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, the half--elf and two of his knights come to the hero's aid.
The carriage is still there, everything is perfect.
Deus ex Machina from Lösion 2.
The Encounter as an introduction to the adventure is too much.
The Group of Goblins later plays a decisive role and is not only cannon fodder.
I was not expecting so many responses, in particular not with so many good proposals and suggestions.
He would be able to implement many of their ideas and he now has more confidence in his narrative.
He has disassembled the lamp again.
and again joined together.
However, it still does not work.

Only so that they have the chance to do everything they can to make him happy.
They have not done anything with the chair.
the Riss was a river.
I was only sitting on the bench.
There was the lower part, so the part with the storage space damaged.
Then all of it is taken away or only the storage part.
He is tired of Sky Sport F1.
In the course of the season,, the quality of the German Sky has decreased so much that he wants to make a little noise with this post.
For the first time, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 coverage to begin.
However, due to the delayed start and the start accident, the time plan was far behind the planning, but the last ( planned ) ten minutes as well as the championship decision could still be shown.
Apparently, from a legal point of view, F1 has priority and as a result, all other broadcasts are restricted, which means that Sky Germany had no choice in this case.
Despite the fact that Sky UK did not broadcast the race in its entirety.
Despite this, a small praise from the commentator Olivier Zwartyes, who has the difficult situation around the serious accident well followed.
Then,, in the F1, the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher made a mistake again, they did not know that, under a red flag, the change of the shoes is allowed.
Although the situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone in the year 2016 had already occurred, it was not until then that both agreed that Verstappen was allowed to change his shoes.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately realized that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
He is of the opinion that such elementary rules should be known when commenting on the F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is also not the first Rätselrate that is now possible or allowed according to the regulations,, both have simple uncertainties in the area of regulations.
In general, he does not like the artificial style of the commentary of Roos, but he also believes that it is a matter of taste.
However, even Heiko Water from RTL is better.
This is also accompanied by constant silliness, both of which are simply unprofessional and have the effect of making Ralf Schumacher's "Uuuuuhd " and Peter Hardenacke 's " Kaffee " order.
In particular, the latter brings total chaos in the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
In addition, the advertising takes over completely at Sky, in the final round, Sky is the only channel that broadcasts the advertisement without commentary directly after the race.
Weder ServusTV or ORF do this.
Both of these channels have less advertising in their training programmes than Sky, which is a Free TV channel.
However, Glock and Baumgartner deserve praise for their work, but this alone is not enough to overcome the shortcomings.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 programme is also very thin and full of repeats.
As a whole, Sky is the worst German--speaking channel to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, RTL has made a better job of the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
In other words, the grandiose F1 season is significantly less enjoyable than it would have been with a proper broadcaster.
Mich would like to know the opinion of the people..

Fans are well suited to supply oxygen to the aquarium in addition.
It is also possible to use a filter system over the air lifter.

If the pumps are strong enough, it is possible to operate entire facilities with them.
Owning a large aquarium, it is necessary to have pumps with two or more outflows, so that more outflows can be connected.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model of the air pump,, but also air curtains ( available in the shop ) and decorations that transform the air bubbles into a function.
There was a treasure chest, shell or similar to call it.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction, which makes it possible to operate at low noise levels.
The installation is very simple.
The blower fan is connected by an air tube 4 to 6 millimeters to an Austrofan or similar, and can then be activated.
The wind pump was to be the same height or higher than the water level and to be placed outside.
The air pump is placed lower than the water level, a backflow valve should be placed between them.
The air tube was simply cut through and the vent was placed in the middle.
This would be prevented when the water flows backward, that the water from the basin flows through the pump.
If the windmill was to be placed in the open,, it was to be covered and protected from moisture like other windmills.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power units that consume little energy.
Even though in eBay the processing time is stated as 3 days, they are packed every day and the packages are picked up every day.

They only want to make a little preparation so that no one is upset, only because it lasted a little longer than expected.

" New Shepard " flies up to 100 kilometers.
The rocket system " New Shepard " flies mostly autonomously.
During the flight of the rocket, the capsule separated and reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times with weightlessness, before it was gently landed by large parachutes.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between the Earth and the sky, but there is no definitive international regulation.
It was the third manned All All flight by Blue Origin. In the first, in July, the company's founder, Bezos was on board together with his brother Mark, an 82 year old former US pilot and an 18 year old Norwegian.

He had already been informed about his career prospects prior to the start of his studies,, but he still believed that he would be able to complete his studies and graduate.
At the moment, there are doubts, in particular the career prospects.
On the one side ( Studycheck etc ) it is said that there are always great job opportunities and that the job is very sought after, on the other side it is said that there are unemployed biologists and poorly paid jobs.

Extra stress before vacation and holiday weekends.
This topic came up last week with him.
He had to now use his long weekend to relax from it.
Therefore, only now a post was added.

Nekton Bio facilitates the smooth running of the Mauser and the feather renewal.
Nekton Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, mineral and trace elements and 200,000 µg of biotin per kilogram.
Nekton Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of the wing injuries occurring in the aviary are due to feeding errors.
Since the feathers are made of protein, a particularly rich and balanced protein feeding of the birds is necessary for the formation of an unblemished feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses during the Mauser period are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of Nekton Bio, the disadvantageous proportion of amino acids in most plant--based fodder is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of Nektoton B, no other vitamin preparations were given.
Nekton Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be added to the drinking water or the soft food.
Vielen Dank, he has found it.
It still doesn't work.
The DDR Handarbeits model Altbau E 95 03 DRG / DR, the Lok was in use in Schlesien and Mitteldeutschia, the very rare Lok comes from a 1968 modification proposal for the Model Railway Magazine Heft 11. It was used with play marks and missing parts. The Baureihe E 95 is a heavy freight locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society ( DRG ) that was conceived for the traction of heavier coal locomotives in the Schlesian network. It is possible that the locomotive's bauset also came from the small series company Schuttske and Bachmann.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle ( Saale ) and has been rebuilt.
The German Reichsbahn Society had the AEG commissioned in 1924 to produce proposals for an electric locomotive capable of carrying 2,200 tons of coal and 530 tons of passengers at a speed of 45 miles per hour.
The maximum speed was 65 km / h.
The DRG decided in March 1926 to deliver the locomotive as a 1- Co + Co 1 locomotive with Tatzlager engines from AEG with the delivery of the mechanical parts to the Siemens- Schuckertwerke with the delivery of the electrical parts.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, with the operational numbers E 95 01 – 06.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the later Soviet Union again.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred as reparation goods to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesseration work in Dessau, the workability of all six locomotives was confirmed.
With the increasing electrification of the middle German railway network, a growing demand for locomotives for the heavy freight train service led to the rebuilding of the three locomotives E 95 01, E 95 02 and E 95 03, with the remaining locomotives serving as replacement locomotives.
The first batches of E 04, E 44 and E 94 were prioritized.
It was not until the E 94 was withdrawn that it became apparent that the number of upgrades could not be further increased, at which time the E 95 became the focus of the upgrades.
The locomotives were initially stationed at the Bahnbetriebswerk Leipzig- Wahren.
They came to the Bahnbetriebswerk Halle P. in 1960.
They were used in a separate timetable mostly for coal trains from the Geiseltal heading to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated steering of the locomotives proved problematic.
It happened more often that the shooter was left on the scene of the shooting.
Dann, the guard on the locomotive had to constantly accompany Beimann with a hammer and a wooden wedge. to dismantle the shooter during the journey.
Damage to the steam engines occurred more frequently and led to month-long shutdowns of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new locomotives were available and a significant expansion of the electric fleet was not planned at the time, so that the E 95 were withdrawn from service.
They added that the Deutsche Reichsbahn Elektrolokomotives only wanted to operate with one--man crews because of difficulties with the machinery and visibility from the pilot's seat.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid 1969, the E 95 01 was withdrawn on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was never used.
Until the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 replaced the future Museumslokomotive E 77 10 as a Weichenheizanlage at the Hauptbahnhof Halle.
It took a long time to convince the authorities of the Reichsbahn that the E 95 as a museum locomotive was worthy of preservation.
In 1979, the initially external renovation of the locomotive began with the goal of being able to present it in the RAW Dessau as a showpiece.
The locomotive belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum in Dresden since 1959 as a non- operational museum locomotive.
1986 the interior of the locomotive was completed.
In the Halle ( Saale ) railway museum, the locomotive is preserved.
Since 1995, Mitarbeiter of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational rehabilitation of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the Lokomotive was able to participate in an exhibition at the Museums BW in Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintings being presented, while the transformers were examined and five steam engines were operational.
The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Silesian Mountains Railway and the branch lines, where they proved to be reliable due to their low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the aircraft were transferred to the Mitteldeutsche Network in Leipzig.
Haupteinsatzgebiet was initially Schlesien.
The Handarbeits model H0 in OVP, the function is good, the locomotive has to be decorated with its own efforts and has to be covered with dust and smell of the cellar. It is a very rare handarbeits model and a very small edition. It is possible that the locomotive's bauset was made by the small series company Schuttschke and Bachmann.

A house fire with two lightly injured and heavy damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a house in Oberbayern.
In addition, damage in the six- million Euro range has been estimated, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport on the adjacent house in Kinsau ( Landkreis Landsberg am Lech ) .
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not rule out an intentionally set fire.
The Kripo of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.

To discredit Fake News, Biontech CEo publishes an AIDs photo.
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first infection in 2021 on the social network " Linkedin " .
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously spoken publicly about his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur released a photo of his coronavirus infection.
The illness of a friend has made him to do so, said Şahin.
The CEo and co---ounder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin has released a photo showing that he has received an infection against the Coronavirus.
In the social media, there were false reports that he had not been vaccinated.
In fact, his wife and he have received 3 doses of the Biontech- Pfizer vaccine .
"For several months, friends have been urging him to post a photo of him being injected to counter the false rumors.
He had previously rejected it because it was not about him personally.
But a call in the previous week changed his opinion: "He was deeply distressed when he learned that an old school friend of his was fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe case of the disease and has been hanging on a respirator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, appears to be fear, which is often caused by misinformation and mistrust. "
It is hard for fear to deal with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In the Internet, circulated an interview with the German Wave, in which Uğur Şahin said that he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as well as the German Welle itself clarified.
"It is not legal at the moment for him to obtain the vaccine himself. " Şahin said at the time.
There is a priority in the distribution of the vaccines in Germany.
In the meantime, the priority of being vaccinated has been abolished - and the Biontech CEo has been vaccinated three times.
Thousands of people without electricity due to a fire in the power plant.
In several municipalities in North Rhine- Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening, no electricity and in many cases also no heating.
A fire brigade station was shut down.
After a fire with severe damage to a power station, thousands of people in the Rhine- Saar region of North Rhine- Westphalia had to be without electricity for 24 hours.
Due to the fire on Friday evening, 41,000 inhabitants and inhabitants were left without electricity in several communities.
Westnet reported that on Saturday, many emergency power plants were in operation until the large-- scale disruption was finally resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and members of the THW provided assistance in the communes.
The authorities offered shelter in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The Versorger thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
They are aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
They also thanked the affected municipalities, the county, the fire forces and the THW for their unremitting efforts.
The repair of the damage would still take several days, as the Westnet workers initially only provisorily reopened some of the lines. he said.
A technical defect led to the fire.
The water flows again.
The fire that broke out at 19:15 on Friday destroyed parts of the 10,000 volt switching station in Neunkirch- Seelscheid.
Detailed cleaning and repair work was required.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 volt high voltage level was established.
With the help of these bypasses, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 18 hours, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had again received electricity.
The remaining 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirch- Seelscheid were gradually added from 21.30.
Since 23.15 hours, also the last ones affected by the fall had lost their electricity supply.
More than 80 workers from Westnet and partner companies were involved in the work.
The authorities had after the establishment of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon also called for neighbourhood assistance.
It is important now that the citizens in their neighborhood take care of elderly or lonely people and report to the local fire brigade headquarters when help is needed,, said Landrat Sebastian Schuster ( CDU ) after a crisis meeting.
The main focus was on the inhabitants of old people's homes when it came to the installation and operation of emergency power plants.
In addition,, according to Behörden reports, temporary care places were set up in schools for those who were not able to care for themselves or those who were dependent on medical equipment.

They wanted plates with a diameter of # Number.
They have a diameter of 155 cm.
Today came his PRS organization,, but he can not put them together and thus shorten them.
He can help him further.
Otherwise, he had to send them back, because they were not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased with a response.
This is actually easier.
Then they make it so.
Send it to him by mail.
The repairs are now complete.
He had already tried this before the Chat.
In the days before the purchase, he had not restarted the EPRS organization.
I will now do it.
An extremely low subsidy is almost unacceptable.
The two are not in agreement.

In order for the paint to be applied evenly and cleanly, it is necessary to clean the parts with a small amount of soap and water of dust, grease and fingerprints and to rinse and dry them with clear water.
Before painting the first time with a new color on the model, it is suggested that 2 to 3 strokes are practiced.
This can be seen on the inside of the building or on a yoghurt bowl.
The first stroke on the building.
He draws the pencil evenly, stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers causes a uniform surface later.
Avoid rapid back and forth strokes with the pencil.
As a result, unrealistic areas are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Begin with the bright colors.
The dark ones could later become visible.
The metallic tones and metallic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unpleasant metallic streaks when they are mixed with normal colors.
Lasse the painted parts dry for a day before he burned them.
The original appearance of the models is achieved by the decals or abziehbilder.
From the insignia on aircraft to the ship's names to the decorations on model aircraft. The decals give the model the final polish.
To place the decals in the correct order while the parts are still reachable.
A flight cockpit is easier to be installed before it is installed in the fuselage..
More important than the right tool, at the time of gluing, patience and a calm hand are needed.
Schneiding each required decal individually and arranging them accordingly.
Decals are also known as "Waterslide paintings" because their backsides are shortened with water until the carrier paper darkens.
Then he moves the picture a small distance from the paper and places the piece on the corresponding place on the model ( which he had previously moistened ) .
While the Decal is attached to the model with a tool, it is pulled away from the side.
Attention should be given to whether the image is correctly placed before it is completely removed from the paper, so that it does not stick to the fingers, wrinkle or tear.

Childbirth prevention at the PKV and the meaning of " a " Versicherungsfall "
Hallo together.
They had been in the custody of the Children's Welfare Board for some time, and now that the dispute with the PKV has been settled, they have suddenly turned against it.
The Reihe after.
They had applied for the Children's Welfare Program at the PKV beforehand and received the approval for 3 trials.
The experiments were not limited in any way ( e.g. time frame, success, etc. )
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was compensated by the PKV.
A few years later, they attempted to have a second child, and underwent two ( unsuccessful ) IVF attempts, which they did not count as part of the PKV.
They applied again for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After several more attempts ( more attempts were made than agreed and logically the most expensive ones were reimbursed by the PKV ) the reimbursement was made to the PKV and they received the disappointing news that instead of 5 attempts ( 2 and 3 ) only 3 attempts were reimbursed.
The Begroundation is that with the pregnancy and birth, the other two attempts of the first promise fail.
The second Children's Wish was a new case.
According to the AGB, the accident begins with the treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists.
The questions to the experts in the round here.
The one who has the right is the PKV ( only 3 attempts are reimbursed ) or they ( there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed ).
The PKV had to warn that with the birth of a child, the further attempts were lost.
The desire for a second child is a new cause of concern.
The unfruitfulness ( caused by blocked sperm channels ) is not healed by the first child.
It would have been super if the experts here gave their opinion.
Many thanks for the first time for their help.
Can he give him the three variations by email,, and that he will send them back to him in the best way.
In order.
They are not going to buy more from them.
When they combine the turnover of him and his friend # Name # ( the same address ) they have apparently lost good customers.
They are allowed to pass it on to their manager.
It is not competitive.
The day before, his colleague told him that the reimbursement order had been issued and now he says that he must first send the thing back.
I can't do anything to prevent the commode from being completely destroyed by his arrival.
In the screenshots, the colleague had written.
It is clear and clear that the reimbursement was initiated and he has not received any reimbursement from the PRS organization.
They can arrange with their manager that they have lost two Stammkunden.
His friend has also ordered various pieces of furniture for their apartment.
The things they are no longer doing.
However, the defect did not become apparent until a few months later.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell them as office chairs.

Good day, he has a question to their series of PRS organs.
These products are advertised with additional hockers,, but they cannot be found at these hockers.
They can help.
The theme of the week is the best low budget films.
A low budget film is a film with a low budget. There is no general definition of a low budget film with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say about it.
A low budget film or low budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the Net there are many lists of low- budget films,, such as on Letterboxd.
They have interesting representatives of this category.
What attracts them to it.

" Halber victory " against Belarus with high costs for the European Union.
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can claim a " half victory " in the conflict with the Belarussian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Pressedienst.
According to the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP), the EU has not resolved the conflict.
This stalemate - Belarus does not give way completely, but the EU feels itself as the winner - is still going on for a while.
Bossong said that the treatment of the people at the border was not in accordance with the European human rights convention.
There is an " increasing normalization of pushbacks " by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not opposed to it,, the rights of the individual are at risk.
This development weakened the unity of the Union.
"She can not, apparently, overcome when a member state sets itself in the head and wants to do its own thing,, like Poland, which does not allow the EU border protection agency Frontex to gain access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, as Bossong said, an agreement on the asylum policy has been hampered because the line " border guard, border guard, border guard " has been strengthened.
A second attempt to cross the border.
According to the Polish Border Guard, migrants have again attempted to cross into Polish territory from Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested and returned to the border on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were attacked by the migrants with stones near the village of Czeremsza.
The soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard recorded 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday night, a group of 28 migrants overcame the border fence.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the previous months.
The EU is throwing out Alexander Lukaschenko as the ruler in Minsk, with the prospect of being allowed to enter the EU.
Poland and Lithuania closed border crossings according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened the airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travel to the countries of origin of the migrants in order to prevent their return.
The most effective element of the EU's reaction was the pressure on the airlines.
"The EU has thrown its markets into the balance and demonstrated its determination with hard measures and extraterritorial sanctions to operate.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarussian society was not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus routinely sent thousands of people through the border.
Mercedes protested after the controversial Formula 1 final.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.

He tests it.
He speaks with the bank and will report to them again.

He submitted the return form for the item the previous day, but has not received any confirmation.
His question was whether his request had begun.

Their mistakes, which they rectify and not all from their household.

He is sorry, but only because he says he is not an anti--semit. but this is meaningless.
It is the same as when an athlete says he has nothing against foreigners.
They are both not theirs.
However, Kollegah constantly reproduces anti--semitic messages.
When one wants to distance oneself, it is necessary to do this completely..
Then, he is as little serious as Kollegah.
One who seriously questions the fundamental basis of evolution is completely lost.
Meintwegen has a God who has brought the whole thing into motion.
As soon as he becomes a creationist, he has to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is a bunch of nonsense.
And as a result, he is a science enemy and is not to be taken seriously as a colleague.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the telescope should be placed as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic and achromatic shaped lens system allows them to use the telescope with a practically undistorted view and without color distortion up to the edge zone.
Frequently, lupes with magnification indications are marked.
However, these figures apply only to exact fixed conditions, which seldom correspond to the use conditions.
In order to be able to use the telescope to its full potential, they were asked to take into account the indications in the table " Technical details " ( see the instructions in the packaging ) .
On the surface of the lens of all optical devices – also in telescopes – there are light reflections.
Through the use of an antireflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
In the optimal use conditions, the reflection on the lens surface is less noticeable.
There are other hints in the accompanying instruction manual ( available in German and English ).

and the with the Gutschein.
Otherwise, he is away as a guest.
However, he has received a defective delivery and now has to pay the full price.
Dann, he would also be judged in the same way.
There is no need for discussions about the better court,, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning spit.
Both have therefore their name.
In English, the equivalent is something like the " turner, which is not as tasty as it sounds.
Problems with Fibre and Devolo DLan or Magic.
They have had a new glass fibre connection in the house for a few weeks.
However, he has problems with building a stable WiFi network.
Previously, he had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used the Devolo DLan, which was uninterrupted until a few incidents, with 50 Mbit transmission and reception.
The new fiber-optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the Fritzbox 7590 and the DLan module attached to the Fritzbox,.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the WiFi, transmits less than the full 500, instead, as the distance from the module increases, the amount of WiFi decreases ( i.e. a plug which is 1, 2 or 3 rooms away from the other module transmits less than the full 500 ) .
This leads to the Internet with the new Glasfaser connection now being slower than before ( ~ 45 Mbit ).
He also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLAN, but there were also large losses.
It is hard to explain why with fiber-optics so much Internet speed is lost on the Strom line.
And LAN is the only solution.
It would have been extremely expensive to lay the LAN cable in the house.
He is really frustrated about the fact that he had to have an extra account created for him.
Therefore, he would have been more pleased with an answer.
When it is time to change the Giroconto.
He who thought that the Girokonten would have peace, is disappointed.
While many banks have used the autumn to take advantage of their customers by raising their fees once more, they have also reduced the freebet rates for negative discounts further.
The German Bank, for example, had a ceiling of 100,000 euros for a long time.
She has reduced the freedom allowance by half and quadrupled the daily allowance.
In the first step, the border was lowered only for customers of the Postbank division of the conglomerate - 50,000 euros for Giro and 25,000 euros for Tagesgeld.
In the meantime, these lower Freibeträge have been established for the entire German Bank,, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
and not only for new contracts, but also for " new individual agreements with existing customers.
The Commerzbank was already down to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at the Inge Germany.
The low-- cost conscious customers' favourite direct airline DKB has lowered the freebets from 500,000 euros to 250,000 euros first and then to 100,000 euros.
In total, more than 100 banks have a freebet of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank of Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros. However, there is still a legal dispute with the Consumer Protection Association, which initially won the case against this regulation at the Land Court of Berlin.
In the banks, discussions have already begun about whether the institutes should be able to reestablish themselves, in the event that the upper authorities declare the negative discounts in principle as unacceptable and millions of bank customers have to be reimbursed.
The board for 8 people was delivered instead of the board for 6 people.

Jennifer Aniston has a whole army of beauty.

Jennifer Aniston (52 ) was elected by the US magazine " The Hollywood Reporter " as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who in 2021 with the " Friends " reunion and the continuation of the series " The Morning Show " achieved fame, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Her appearance is the subject of a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers.
However,, Aniston said that she would give herself a Chip a day ( a single Chip from the tube ) .
That the hearts of the female and male fans are still equally attracted to her is, in fact, a miracle.
Perhaps, because they have been unlucky with their luck and are still looking for the great love.
and the baby wish from the list has been removed.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt them.
The people who questioned him had no idea what his medical condition was, why he was unable to play.
It was really hurtful.
It is to be hoped that success and fame will also bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career Räikkönen has to retire.

The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndal with 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled pilot.

The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig on the third place.
For him, it was a great achievement, his first podium in the World Cup, he was very happy that Mariama was with him.
He is super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start,, but the start times today were good, said Burghardt and emphasized that " it is not only the start, but there is also a lot of work around it. "
He was annoyed about the not entirely error- free journeys, but said that " it is going in the right direction ".
He had the Decke in the Warenkorb and could now buy it.
I don't know what to do.
He has not received it and therefore has not been able to fulfill it, which is why he finally asked for it.
Due to the corona, he had other problems in 2010 and had no time for it.
And then he said he had left, which made him very angry.
They were looking at the Chat at the Asare Sitzbank.
I want to get it back and then buy it again, because it is currently reduced..
It was not until 16 March 2013 that the first shipment was launched.

Only for one day, only for one week, only until XY.
Halo the lovely beautiful women and girls and women.
He has a number of things he wants to write,, and he wants to write it in English or another language.
He is 24 years old, is a full--time student and a mother of a dog, even though his dog does not scream or goes to the kindergarten, he is, in fact, 1 to 1 his child.
His friend, with whom he has been together since 1968, has a burn of the second degree and has been depressed for years, but is now in therapy.
He visited him the day before because he also had emotional needs and because he wanted to see and feel him, they had a lot of kissing and it was nice.
He helped him in the shower ( because his hand is in a band due to burns )
He is also cold and they see him less ( once or twice a week ) and this makes it difficult for him to fulfill his needs for affection and love.
His puppy is suffering from a stomach ailment, he has been fed and now lies in his cushion bed and has been slightly relaxed after being fed with a heat lamp and stroked by him.
He lives alone with his sister and his mother, who is away for a month.
Now, they also have to deal with housework, which they divide between them.
But even cooking is a lot of work for him.
His PTBS illness is now in a good state, he is halfway through his therapy and is recovering.
He is not well,, but he gets through and is almost symptom free.
His university demands a lot ( for him , at 15 o'clock he has a written test for which he has not done much preparation and the next day he has an anatomy hour for which he has done some preparation.
And in the next week, he has an oral examination on the 15th of the month, and what comes after that is in his calendar and not in his head because there is no room for it in his head.
Also, his week goes like this: Only until the next day, then it is the weekend.
But after that, the whole game goes on..
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only for a short period of time..
And so the eternity goes on.
He believes that he is so stressed that he needs these mental anchors, because otherwise he can't handle it.
In some way, he feels guilty and " chaotic " but in a different way, he cannot do it.
It is also the same for them.
He is endlessly grateful that he does not have to work.
I'really unendibly grateful that he can't express in words.
He does not know whether he has survived the rest of his kptbs.
He believes that this is partly due to the mental burden of women, and as a result, he thought that he would find fellow sufferers there.
He wants them to have a relaxed evening, the week is almost over.
He has received his order today, unfortunately, the entire other color plus the surface is scratched and the table has an imprint.
In the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
They are very disappointed.
What they can offer to him.
When they change the table, they will get a different color or something like that..
The email for the cancellation was sent on 26 December 2012.
In the other two times.
He was not confirmed..
In the school, he stated that many of the religion teachers do not believe in God and it is only a further subject like mathematics or geography.
For him, it was always a bit strange, perhaps also because he was raised as a Christian and he always believed in something.
As to this.
Perhaps he can also tell the story to his colleagues from work or studies with different perspectives.
In general, he understands the difference between private and professional and it is beneficial to separate them.
It also has a curriculum.
He also found it strange that a physics professor who did not believe in the theory of relativity.
The reason for wanting to teach religion is that he does not believe in it.
Culture or something like that.
The question is not about privacy.
Kann it not be changed or not. He writes in English, which he also understands well.
This has been going on for a long time, then he decided not to pursue it.
It is good, it is good.
He expects a response within a few days, but no later than the beginning of the next week.
Danke for their support.
Film search help.
Loved by the people.
He is looking for a film from his childhood ( he is 24 ).
I believed it was a film for young people.
In the film, there are two time axes ( or parallel worlds ) .
For the first time, the Modern ( real world )
The other is the past ( or the Kingdom of the Dead )
Because she cannot be described in detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
and in the Kingdom of the Dead, a young soldier ( uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the Fluch of the Caribbean )
For no apparent reason, the paths diverge and a situation is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Kingdom of the Dead, who the woman in this kingdom wants to bring to life so that she can survive.
The Übergang is believed to be the grave of the soldiers.
At the end, the two soldiers fight against each other.
Falls he says something, he is grateful for every response.

Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf.

The battery is broken.
In the evening, his laptop ( Thinkpad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old ) was no longer able to be powered by his power supply.
This was bought about 5 months ago and is still functioning.
He thought that the Netzteil alone was enough to operate.
Failure, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start despite the installed power supply.
As a result, he has dismantled the battery,, but there is still nothing.
Vllt have their ideas.
A new battery has been ordered, but it is not possible to use the laptop in networked operation.
There is something broken.
Many thanks for their help.
He wants the delivery of the PRS Org until the room.
I don't know how to book it.
I is interested in the # PRS Org 's chair.
He does not know how high the seat is.
Often on tour and still with a lot of equipment.
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem.
The 20- liter capacity can also accommodate larger photography equipment without problems, which are securely stowed in the padded Flex Fold teiler.
and the other things that he needs for everyday use are also well organised and separated from the camera equipment.
With the " Update " of the Everyday Line to the version 2 ( V2 ) the series is also presented in a new look.
The sophisticated and minimalistic design has become legendary - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed several highly innovative solutions that effectively protect the interior of the backpacks and, at the same time, allow access to the equipment in seconds.
It works with two possibilities: firstly conventionally through the deckelklape, which can be closed with the Maglatch closure system, and secondly with a very well- thought out solution for effective protection, which has already proved effective in the Messenger Bags.
There is a Verschlusshaken made of metal in the closure of the Verschlussklappe, with a corresponding anchor beam on the front side of the rucksack.
In contrast to most backpacks, Peak Design has designed it with four anchor bars, firmly riveted, in which the closure hinge is hooked.
When the rucksack is fully loaded, he takes the highest beam, when it is less loaded, he takes a lower beam.
The Klappenverschluss and Haken are also magnetic.
The rucksack can also be closed reliably without the hook being inserted.
The second possibility also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Rucksack from other backpacks. On both sides of the Rucksack, there is a Reißverschluss opening.
The elimination of the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from the top - they must not have to dig through the contents.
At the same time, this clever detail increases the all--round usability of the rucksacks enormously. When, in addition to his photography equipment, he also carries everyday objects or travel equipment.
In the Everyday Backpack, the interior can be individually configured (more below) and so both of them can be separated from each other without a problem, and through the two side openings, they can also be accessed independently.
This also allows him to move the backpack from the right side of the body, to reach the camera equipment in the right main compartment while the everyday things remain in the left side of the backpack and do not interfere.
Comfortable and uncomplicated adjustable straps help.
And since the outside of the rucksack is completely made of 100 % recycelled and weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even when it goes to Scotland in the autumn.
He has been waiting for the email from his support for a long time.

It concerns the return of the wrongly delivered Custom Number.
It is impossible to say when the chest could be delivered again.
In this way, it is not an option for him.
It works.
Many, many thanks for the help.

He received a completely different lamp than he ordered.
I want to call him.
When he gave him the extension of the contract, he immediately made a larger order,, but he kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that the previous year was different from what was expected, he did not anticipate it and was not able to fulfill it in time.
However, the damage he has suffered as a customer is unacceptable to him.

Coloma is the city where an unanticipated event changed the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered a glowing rock in the waters of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, it spread quickly and led to the so-called " California Gold Rush " of 1849.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were erected and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Each wanted his share in the wealth of the country.
For many, it was " Coloma or Bankruptcy "
In this game, he is a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
He is going to search for gold, to recruit workers, to breed horses and to build a company.
He will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding river flows and surrounding areas.
He is not alone - the other pioneers have apparently the same idea.
He has to outperform his Pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to victory.
They vote simultaneously for their actions, have to manage their resources and build a tableau that more and more works for them ( so--called " engine building " ) .
The buildings on his tableau allow him to become more efficient, gain additional actions or change the rules in his favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, he can develop his own style of play with minor adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 ( the year in which the gold in Coloma was discovered ) to 1850 ( the year in which California became an official state.
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the map where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate positions.
When a Standort has the most Pioneers, it receives a Sperre.
This deactivated the first half of the site, reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players alternately perform actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up camps, crossing rivers, building bridges, opening businesses and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions have been completed, the Pioneers return.
The Anpreiser turns at the beginning of each round to a new location, thereby changing the available actions.
This goes on until the Anpreiser has moved five times and has covered each position once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the player Coloma must defend against an attacking band of bandits.
When the player has enough Revolverhelden and the bandits are numerically superior, they receive rewards.
When they fail, they receive smaller rewards or end up on the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is announced.
The player with the most points wins.

"The reason that children are not tyrants " documentary, ARD archive.
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse and power abuse.
The ARD documentary is now in his Twitter timeline and he watched it immediately.
The children's psychologist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest in talk shows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his 2008 book " Why their children become tyrants " he caused a heated debate about child rearing.
Former patients and caregivers have now made serious accusations against him.
The film is difficult to watch.
and he is very grateful that many people nowadays think differently and act differently.
The parents and other responsible persons can never, never, never have power over the child.
Their goal must always be to give the child freedom for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is appropriate and possible in the situation.
I still shudder from it.

Previous episodes of Awareness were mentioned in the pre--debriefing.
Certain anesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) are associated with a slight increase in risk.

The " Drive " of the tube endstufe is a major contributor to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sounds.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor Schaltung.
With the Volume, Gain and Master Volume Regulators, they can, on the one hand, achieve the desired volume and on the other hand, the amount of distortion in their sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT + series have a unique power level regulator, which allows the sound level to be reduced without affecting the gain and distortion.
In addition, it was stated that with the Power Level Regulator, it was possible to make a power reserve available, when the sound became unbearably loud.
Thanks to the Power Level Regulator, the entire potential of the VT + series can be used in every situation.
The Kopfhörerbuchse can also be used as a line out.
The accompanying signal is, in fact, simulated with a box, so that even with the use of headphones or direct recordings, an eminent " acoustic " sound effect is achieved.
At the Auxiliary Box, a CD or MP3 player can be attached, so that they can play their favorite songs.
A tuner is also on board, so they do not need a separate tuning instrument.
If, in addition, a VFS5 foot stomper is purchased, the sounds can also be called by foot, the effect blocks are turned on and off and the tempo of the correspondingly compatible effects " tapped ".
For the live performance, this is, in fact, indispensable.

He has just received his delivery and wanted to know whether screws as part of the delivery were intended.
He would like to hang the @ PRS @ Organization @ Spiegel ( Germany ) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory response and the waiting time has not been fulfilled.
There is a premium customer status at Euch.
Iran sees progress in negotiations over the nuclear agreement.
At the negotiations over the re-establishment of the international nuclear treaty, signs of progress are apparent.
Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics to be included on the agenda of the negotiations, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday, the news agency Irna.
It was a " positive and important development " because at the beginning, there was no agreement on the topics to be negotiated.

He has to translate it from German to English and put it on the package and hand it over to the post office..
here, he must not do anything further.
He wants to avoid this, so he writes to him.
I would like the return to take place on his own expense.
The 8 euro return fee is in his eyes an injustice.
It is time for change.
The Ambassadors were greeted at the German Parliament in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day.
The purpose of the Post here.
When looking at the activity of the German Parliament in the past months, it can be seen that it is not existent.
They are in a winter slump and have extended the summer gap for several months.
Where the problem lies.
That's the reason for it.
For the most part, this is due to the dissatisfaction, as some things have been lost and the general mood is sour.
In the last days, the impression has become more pronounced that many still have a strong desire to participate in the Bundestag.
#The changes they have to make.
At this point, the community around the MBundestag that wants to keep it alive is called upon.
The impetus came from U and Edizvevo, who had become aware of the project in the last days and found a heap of rubble.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, he also wants to call on them to participate in the project once more explicitly, only then, the project can continue to exist.
They have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which they can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
The server can be joined through this link.
Goals.
The MBundestag will function in the future.
The existing orders must be changed or adapted or removed.
The way they should appear in the future.
The new members are to be recruited.
= The aim is to create a fair election system.
He is fairly certain that he has forgotten some things, which is not serious,, but the end of the discord.
When their desire and time permits, they come to the Discord to work with and decide the future democratically.
He has also ordered a lamp shield from them, which has not yet been delivered.
Now, he sees that the article is too large and bulky for him, and that it is not suitable for his taste.
For this reason, he had already ordered another one from them.
He put it together and noticed this then, when he took the soft cream.
Very sad about it.
He hopes that this will be returned and that he has received a full compensation.
This is also somewhat sad, because the name is darker than expected.
He also has a question: the Tagesdecke # PRS Org. is also available in a larger size, in 240 x 240, for example.
PRS Org must guarantee that the defective tank will be removed as soon as possible.
And he begged her to make it happen.
A suitable packing has not been found, the shelf is to be dismantled as far as possible for the removal - it has to be negotiated with the Prussian Museum.
PRS can call him on the telephone at any time to agree on an evacuation date.
There is an instruction for the assembly.
It took him a long time to decide whether or not to send it back.
She responded to the question of why she is vegan.
He today had a conversation with a colleague whom he likes.
She herself has lived for a while as a vegetarian, eats nowadays very rarely meat.
He himself was also a vegetarian for several years.
On the question of whether he had always wanted to be a vegan and that vegetarianism was a planned interim step, he responded without hesitation.
and that he long thought that he as a vegetarian would support the welfare of animals, but eventually realized and understood that he was also supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, his decision to become a vegan.
In the moment, he had the impression that Missmut came on their side and then defended vegetarianism, saying that she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian she reduced the amount of animal suffering.
He is now asking whether his response to " plump " was.
They responded to the question.
He has the feeling that as a vegan, he quickly finds himself in a corner and conflicts arise, without him being able to intervene.
It greets a harmonious vegan.
It is clear that it is not an exception to § 312d of the BGB.
Their " PRS " Organization does not free them from the statutory regulations for distant broadcasting.
He is due to return on the scheduled date, when the #PRS Org''s return has not yet arrived.
Because he is not present at the burial,, he can not change it either.
He can be given an alternative departure time.
From the 1st of February 2012, he is again to be seen on a regular basis.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for flood protection was equipped with 45,000 euros from the state.
Shortly after, the Rhineland- Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz handed over a grant of 45,000 euros to the new rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Brigade to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
He is pleased that the Land of Rheinland- Pfalz is supporting this. says Lahnsteins Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte.
The Gerätewagen is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rheinland- Pfalz.

He bought a book that he could only read 10 percent of, and then the problems began.
He cannot open the book.

Thanks first for the fact that he did the whole thing, he has also spent almost a decade in the State Service in a similar role, and he was also a weapon bearer in the Executive. Therefore, he does not want to engage in it.
The question of right and left is always very simplified.
In general, it should be said that the Statesman comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum, and not from the revolutionary Left, which would have been clear to everyone.
Naturally, also in the special uniform and weapon carriers, people on the right of the conservative and magical side must also have been clear that these people, then, naturally, with the lived reality would have been hard to deal with. Naturally, it is also clear that there were many Germans with a migrations background, women and homosexuals ( and this means that he is not referring to the overstretched feminine stereotype of the cliched homosexuals, since these are found in the Executive less than average or not at all, but normal men and women who are not noticed when they are not described ) and also on these people can and must rely on their lives or set them aside.
But even these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, according to his experience, because they are proud of Germany and feel that they have been overwhelmed by excessive left-- wing politics, even though they perceive this politics to be unacceptable to them.
Back to the right, since the police and the armed forces are also a cross section of society, there are also extremists on the right there,, but they openly express their views there, can say whatever they want, or even make plans that threaten the state that are overstated in the media and annoy him.
Naturally, it comes before that also police officers and soldiers who were often in overseas missions were often because of negative experiences began to generalize and also say things that are controversial and politically incorrect.
It also happens that the right-- minded comrades meet and engage in a vigorous exchange of ideas.
In spite of this, this view is widely accepted and, with political education and awareness campaigns, the whole issue has been countered.
Germany is so heavily international entangled and this is also a good thing from the point of view that it is not possible for them to have racists and Nazis in their ranks.
That which he does not understand, the other Korb has also been ordered from the German side.

His husband is (unluckily ) also not better, it annoys him somewhat, but most of the time he loses the balance between work and family.
The kitchen is still cleaned regularly because they like to cook.
In response to his question, they have managed to raise their children properly.
They do not have any yet, but they are working on it and this issue has been bothering them for a long time.
But for him, he has no incentive, he is not bothered as much, as long as no visit comes and things like fresh clothing and the kitchen are available.
There is a greater motivation with a child or that the child is lazy.
He is looking forward to their responses.

It was suggested that only so much drinking water and soft food was to be prepared, and that the water and food was to be changed daily.
A stained messlöffel ( inliegend ) is equivalent to 1 gram of neutron bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, the double or triple dosage of Nectron Bio can be given at the beginning, until the formation of new feathers is visible.
After that, the normal dosage is given until the new feathers are fully formed.
Lagering of Nekton Bio should be in dry conditions without sunlight, between 15 ° and 25 ° C.
I have to apologize to them, but the chair is being sold as a bureaucrat's chair.
As a result of 9 months of use, a desk chair can be destroyed.
The guarantees in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Halo, he sent an email on Monday to announce that his shipment was damaged and pictures were attached.
They have received this email.
The statement of a member of the community in opposition to the statute.
Hallo r - Legaladvice.
He has the following problems.
On their property, a walnut tree is to be felled.
Also a complaint was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to him that the cases of fruit trees and consequently the walnut are not part of the statute.
In the statute, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a tree to be protected.
He can now rely on or not rely on the statements of the employees.
On the other side, he must rely on the opinion of an expert.
On the other hand, the statute is unambiguous.
I thanked for their responses.
The understanding they have.
Dann, the new packaging will be used.
He has not received any news.
Then, he still has a sofa without use.
He could have given her a legacy or a gift.
They were more expensive.
I believe that, but the question is whether he will be paid in euros and that the deck will be delivered to him in Germany.
They can be tested.
Eilmelding about a serious traffic accident in Selb.
A heavy traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Anschlussstelle Selb- Nord and Plößberg.
According to the Police's Pressealarm ( 14:03 Uhr ), a Pkw collided with a vehicle in the opposite direction while overtaking.
There are injured.
Ah okay understands.
Good, then many more thanks that it went so smoothly.
Advice and ideas for further career.
First happy Christmas for them.
My Christmas is rather poor,, because his beloved head has been destroyed by all the things that can be destroyed.
Before he now goes out of the hole,,shortly, he needs advice from people who know his situation in some way - i.e. from them.
He is currently doing the Ref as a rookie..
Originally, he studied something else and worked in a field related to it.
The whole was then too boring and he then looked for alternatives that made him more fun.
At some point, he became a pastor and was sure that this was the right thing to do, even though the conditions were more difficult than in his previous job.
He is now at the third " he googles other positions " .
And it is only half a year since.
In the previous games, he has always decided to continue and finish the Ref, after which he can still change direction.
However, he is completely exhausted.
He had the last month so little free time that he was completely exhausted.
There are still holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for him.
Before the Ref, he always thought he was stress resistant, but his weekend was also his weekend and his evening was also his evening.
He had free time.
and the stress on the job was the same in the moment.
He himself feels that the family celebration is too stressful.
And then, there are these rigid structures that annoy him even more.
In general, it is fun and from the outside, the Ref is going well, the feedback is good.
But he is completely exhausted and is wondering how much stress his body can withstand before it completely breaks down..
He wonders whether he wants to spend the rest of his working life in this way,, especially when he reads some of their contributions,, or whether he should return to the area where he was most respected,, where he could take time off when he needed it, , and where he was paid fairly for the work he did in a team , rather than as a lone fighter , as he does most of the time now .
But then he asks himself whether he would then be in the same place as he is now and unhappy.
They notice that it is all irrational,, but they may have ideas or ideas from this situation, that she is completely exhausted and begins to cry at the smallest thought of it.
Decisions are now being made in an emotional way, which is unlikely to lead to anything good.
But perhaps their views can help to see a little light at the end of the tunnels or to enjoy Christmas for the first time..
Danke for the translation and apologized for the whining tone of his voice.
He hopes that his situation has become somewhat clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of Vox has steadily evolved, including the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the " Valve Reactor " control system, which perfectly imitates the behavior of an organ pipe.
With the VT20x, the VT40x and the VT100x Amps, they have created a brand new modeling engine, which in terms of sound is on the latest state of technology.
Dank the Vet Technology ( Virtual Element Technology, which is based on the analysis of the parts and amplifier arrangements, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These Amps also contain the more complex Valvetronix preamplifiers.
This is partly based on actual analog switches, because these give the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated arrangement, the VTX amplifier has a closed chamber and a bass-reflection system, from which the natural resonances only sprout.
With the " Tone Room " software of Vox, they can recreate historical facts on the virtual stage, even correcting and modifying the sound of the amplifier and the effects until it sounds as they have always imagined.
The perfect combination of Röhren sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the 2001 presented Vox Valve Reactor technology.
This was subsequently improved several times to accommodate new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the Vox Valvetronix Series in 2010, with more dynamism and a number of new and decisive amplification models.
From the handy VT 20 + to the VT 120 + with two speakers, the new VT + Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists on the hunt for a maximum variety of sound would find it.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamism of a tube amplifier. They expect a thick sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and the sound of the strings, and a prompt response.
During an initial analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that in particular the endstages of the tubes determine the character of the amplifier and developed the Vox Valve Reactor technology on this basis.
The with a 12AX7 Röhre best-ucked Valve Reactor Schaltung of each VT + Verstärkers forms the behavior of the subtle nuances and the sound character of the Röhrenverstärkers perfectly.
NBA, despite 20 points from Wagner, the Magic lost to the Clippers.
The defeat series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but the victory over the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104-106.
The large main compartment is also adjustable, with three individually placed and foldable Klett closure parts that are suitable for all types of cameras, from spiegelless system cameras of all sizes up to full--format spiegelreflex cameras.
In the end, the size of the camera and the lens determines what can be carried in the rucksack.
A possible armament would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a spotlight.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony A7 series or the Fuji XT2 still have room for additional lenses.
In addition,, one can also stow a lot of auxiliary equipment.
and if he has a small DSLM camera ( MFT cameras from Olympus and Fujifilm X and E series ) he can use the backpack for his equipment and for other things.
Even the drone pilots choose the Everyday Backpack 20L as the optimal choice, because the rucksack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including the remote control and equipment.
A volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma, one of the longest in history.
In the short three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the island of the Canaries have caused great damage.
There is an end in sight.
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
Previously, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585, which lasted for 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable records of previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past days, but vulcanologists were not able to predict when it would end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable " said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state television channel RTVE.
Losses in millions of dollars.
In the three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees Celsius hot lava has destroyed more than 2,900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
It covers an area of almost 1700 football fields..
More than 7,000 inhabitants were evacuated and the damage is estimated to be more than 90 million euros.
Before the coast, two new islands were formed by eroded lava with an area of about 50 hectares.
The banana plantation, which is crucial to the island's economy and from which approximately half of the island's 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly live and which was already in crisis prior to the volcanic eruption, was particularly affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely damaged, the newspaper " El País " wrote.
Christmas and the gifts.
Christmas is on the doorstep and especially the children are not able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension to have a seductive effect.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still unite the increasingly divided society.
The most important thing is to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French anthropologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, is a peace--establishing " social contract of primitive peoples " can be revived and re-established in the context of the tradition.
As from Nikolaus, the Christchild became.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants, through whom the Christmas days were connected with the blessing.
Previously, gifts were given on St. Nicholas' Day in various forms.
The background of the still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the tradition of giving gifts to children with the Stiefel emerged.
Protestants objected to this tradition because they rejected the idea of saints as mediators between God and humans.
From these reasons, they oppose the institution.
Martin Luther transformed the St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and established a new tradition line.
The focus of the festivities shifted to the Christmas Eve.
As the majority of Protestants do not see these details as an issue, only a few are angered by the fact that the tradition of St. Nicholas, including the singing of the St. Nicholas song and the St. Nicholas procession, is still an integral part of the pre-- Christmas period.
Today, one finds in Stiefelfeld in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
The diversity of traditions in Christian countries.
The tradition of the Schenkens goes back to the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the Feast of St. Nicholas was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian- dominated countries, there is a frenzied debate over the question of who is responsible for giving the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it varies from region to region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, a sort of St. Nicholas, who has acquired various characteristics over time.
These include, for example, his white Rauschebart, which has little resemblance to the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference of chimneys to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure of the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy, the Witch Hexe Befana gives the way to the Jesuschild.
In Scandinavia, beasts sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought considerable fame.
There are not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christkind is responsible for the distribution of gifts.

Pill problem
Halo the lovely womenfolk.
He hopes that he has done everything right and that this is his first post after a year of reddit.
Due to the fact that he had to take the Pille again for about five years, mainly because he had severe pain during the Periode and bad PMS before the Periode.

His main problem was not the pain, but his skin.
During his last approximately two--year hiatus from 0 to 100 explosive pimples, he had them all over his body.
As far as possible, but he has been so badly affected and he has not felt well.
In the two years of the pause, the whole situation has never been normalized.

Training plans ( EK )
Hello dear colleagues and colleagues.
He has been in the RF since summer, he enjoys the training,, but he still has major problems planning his studies in geography.
However, his school is technically poorly equipped, so he can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In the school, he can also copy S and W films without cost.
He needs a lot of time to plan his hours.
They are, for example, currently working on the theme of geofactors, and he is,, in fact, on his feet almost every hour.
In principle, the methods used are the same, but at the same time, he also wants to use less time for the rehearsals ( which he also uses for UBs and so on ). .
When planning, he usually starts from the goal he wants to achieve, and then decides how he can achieve it ( usually he writes a sheet of paper with texts from books that his school does not have ) .
They have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, he is not satisfied.
Daher also the work sheets.
Possibly, he can teach me how to work efficiently with the book.
He would have been happy.
I would like to return the @ PRS @ Organization @ from the @ Number @ list.
He has already decided on a new job at the PRS organization,, but he would like to wrap up the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed to enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and complains of income losses.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations damage the importance of the Christmas trade of the Handelsverbandes Deutschland ( HDE ) .
In businesses with goods of non- daily use, breakdowns in sales were criticized by HDE's chief executive, Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey of 1,100 dealers by the HDE, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative view of the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the high point of the year, is now often a hole without a bottom " said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre- crisis sales in the previous week.
It went well only in the foodstores and in the online area.
The Federation demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with a mask, with a distance and a hygiene concept was a safe situation, said the head of the company.
" 2G at the market does not bring them any further in the fight against the pandemic. he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off passengers and required a high level of personnel.
He demanded that the band regulation would be allowed throughout the country.
Thereafter, every customer would only have to pass through 2G ( infected or recovered ) control once and would be allowed to enter all businesses with the band on that day.
In addition,, in the retail sector,, like previously in the public transport with the 3G rule ( those who have been vaccinated, those who have recovered and those who have been tested ) , stichprove surveys are inadequate.
Even the specialized on shopping centers real estate conglomerate Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The Frequencies were down to less than 25 percent of the pre--corona levels and the umsales were down to 90 percent.
Theses numbers are now in the middle of the so important Christmas business, the chairman of the board Wilhelm Wellner said to the " Economic Week " .
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs associated with the Center, solutions were sought and approved.
This also includes the so-called Bändchen solution, in which " the visitors, for example, once at a central location in the center present their 2G proof and then, wearing an armband similar to those used in a club hotel, can freely enter all the shops.
He has recently ordered and received the PRS Organization..
The Spiegel has a scratch and the frame also has a flaw, which was covered with a yellow substance.
It looks ugly.
He wanted to return the Spiegel and had already put it back in the package and sealed it.
He has to go further with the Retour now.
The Lampe is designed for Dual Balance based on new, flat SMD - LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp is controlled by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities.
In addition to the adjustment of the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures, daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to adjust the color temperature in the range of 3100 – 5650K manually and to store it.
They use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controllers is that they are easy and intuitive to use.
The Leuchte produces a very strong light stream with a soft light of high quality, completely free of flickering.
The beam angle of 120 degrees with the ability to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is impressive.
In addition, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
They can adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool both on the film set and in the studio..
The optional available DMX 512 controller allows for the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in a difficult to access location.
On the back of the Leuchte is the control panel, it consists of switches and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness level in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F Akkus, which are not included in the delivery.
The viewer has up to three panels for brightness and color temperature.
In order to achieve the positioning of the individual positions on the storage plates, a longer pressing of one of the storage plate tastes is required.
The lamp controller records the current state of the lamp when it is shut down, so that when it is reopened, the known situation is reestablished - very practical in the studio when, for example, the camera is set to a specific color temperature.
Working with batteries is one of the major strengths of the DL3120. the ability to operate with good NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen ( and women ) - so they can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also be tested before the set, it has a battery tester built in, and for each of the two battery compartments there is a score in the two display panels ( the upper one for the upper battery compartment and the lower one for the lower one.
In addition, it is also possible to continuously supply power to the projector with the accompanying net power supply.
The construction of the projectors is very simple.
They have a 16 mm hinge as an attachment to allow them to be attached directly to their photostable.
The inclination is by means of stabilizers on both sides to be reliably set.
It was also emphasized that the mechanical components are extremely high- quality and that they are designed to withstand hard use.
In addition, a Neigegelenk is included in the package.
Grossartig is the fact that the package also contains a bag.
So they can take the Leuchte with all the accessories that they may still want to buy, without problems transporting or storing it.
It is a shame that he has given it away and it is too small.
"The party they wanted to throw after a torrid comeback against Leverkusen "
It was a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a row defeated Hessen appeared to be on the way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
However, then the SGE turned the game around, scored five goals within a good hour and won fiercely with 5-2. "It's insane what the boys have done today, jubilated coach Oliver Glasner at DAZn and spoke a " general praise to all the players who were there.
However, at the beginning, it looked like another setback for the now ninth- placed Frankfurters, who were behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had the Leverkusener with a 2-0 lead.
What then happened also impressed the SG coach.
"As the players then returned and a fantastic performance was shown, Glasner continued.
He is extremely happy with the performance they have shown and also with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who returned to the field for the first time since the fourth game and overcame his muscle injury, also emphasized the moral of his teammates.
He believes that his team's mentality is unbelievably strong, said the 27-year old and was pleased with a glance at the result in particular for the spectators.
That was the party they wanted to throw.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, sees himself, at the same time, in a good position in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that all the players are fit in December, that all the players are physically in a top condition.
It is Top- Work in the medical department, but also the players live high professionally.
He wanted to " step forward step by step and remain modest " and continue the tasks until the end of the year " on this level " .
The next match is scheduled to be played on Wednesday as part of the English Week against Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 Uhr, Sky ) on the schedule.
He received the mail that his package was returned to him due to a mistake on his part.
He has tried to contact @ PRS Org @ and has been rebuffed.
It can be sent directly back to him or it must wait until the money is returned and the order is resubmitted.
In his case, it would mean that he would not be able to order again because it had already been delayed for a long time.
They have been on the board of the PRS before..
Dampers for the women's handball team before the quarterfinal against Spain.
Germany's women's handball team walked away from the humiliating defeat against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes on the court.
At the end of the World Championship main round, the DHB selection lost to Spain 16 - 32 (8 – 13 ) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers with a heavy defeat and must now face the host country in the quarterfinals.
They were too nervous and had too much respect for the opponent, coach Henk Groener judged.
Against Spain, they must appear differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8 points as second behind the Danes (10 points) .
It is sad that they did not take the flow with them.
It was a bad game from all sides, they had to lose it. said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to qualify for the semi--finals against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on the following day, a significant improvement is needed to keep the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three- times Olympic champion Denmark was the backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
" They were simply not there, neither in the attack or in the defense, defensive player Xenia Smits said and demanded that " they must now quickly look ahead " .
From front to back, not on the height.
Anders than in the previous five tournament matches, the German team was not on the same level from the start of the match.
Failures and technical errors in the attack and holes in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the job and prevented worse with several saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9 minutes and 30 seconds, when Grijseels completed a quick counterattack.
The expected initial ignition was not achieved.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women were hardly able to get into the scene, and when they did, they often failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was already lost with a 3-10 deficit after 20 minutes because of the early lead, and Mia Zschocke was forced to leave the game because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, she can again participate.
Only in the final phase of the first half, the DHB selection started to get into the game, and by the end of the first half they were only five goals behind.
The only faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes when the score was 9-19.
The Greener Shotgunners failed again in all areas and made it easy for the well--prepared opponent, who is one of the medal contenders in the final round.
As a result, the German team was not able to achieve a performance increase and went as a clear loser from the court.

goes the same way with them.
The title states that he is a field doctor in mobile impfing teams, in which ( until now only ) the BioNTich and Pfizer impfing substance is used in care homes.
Because these are now almost completely finished, they then go to a part of the immunization centers for further treatment..
He is willing to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also on medical issues, as long as they are not personal in nature (e.g. " he takes medication X and tolerates it with the immunization. "
In his area of responsibility is the dissemination of information about the impfing, the indications for the impfing ( the person is entitled to be impfed according to the corona impfing regulations and there are no grounds to oppose the impfing ) the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency treatment of allergic reactions ( which has never occurred ) .
The injection itself can be delegated to qualified personnel,, for example, medical assistants.
In Impfeteams, they are often absent,, but " only " ( by God's will ) pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of the infectious substance, but they are not able to carry out the infectious injections themselves, so that they also carry out most of the infectious injections themselves.
Heavy " Huidlerer " problem is solved in Amberg.
This is a "Huidlerer "
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger,, it has caused a lot of controversy in the BR television series " Winners in Bavaria " .
However, unlike many previous days, the term remained unchanged in the series of " host mi " this time.
No, it was a " nervous man ".
And also no one, " who has to move quickly.
The people heard that the TV moderator was completely wrong.

"The Huidlerer, who was seen by the audience, " is a Lappen who wiped the chimney.
Dialektologist Antony Rowley, from the Bavarian Television since years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Oberpfalz term, derived from the more familiar Mundart word "Houdern.
With the closure of a gap in education, many of those who had lived in the area of Amberg for a long time.
He has been unable to buy books for two weeks.
It comes after the confirmation with the following error message: oops - something went wrong - to try again later.
He has started the #PRS ' Org ' again, with the PC connected, synchronized and repaired.
No one has been able to help.
The choice of wheels for the racing bike is actually very safe.
In the morning, he was full of energy because he wanted to train for his bicycle tour in the following week.
Said and done and he drove with his racing bike, which he bought the day before on eBay.
The first 40 km were also beautiful,, but then the same thing happened in every inner city ( this time in Krefield ) .
Glassplitter on the track.
Zack's loud screams and his rear wheels did not want to participate in the rest of the track.
Due to the fact that he did not have any real possibility of obtaining a replacement jacket and helmet, he had to turn around and take the first available train back to his home.
It was then also financially not so bad,, perhaps it is also better when he changes the wheels for the second time during the Radtour..
Now, he stands before a question and hopes that they can help him.
As he has a relatively long journey over several days ahead of him, he would not want to face this problem again.
Now, the situation was not so bad, because the old wheels of the previous owner ( a very nice old man who came to pick up the bicycle on the day it was handed over and had traveled 140 km with them, which were also described as suboptimal because he had used them for many years on a roller.
When, however, he thinks that he will have to change the tires at a speed of 80 to 90 km/ h, he is really unhappy.
He had a conversation with an older man at the airport who asked him why he did not have the Marathon Plus wheels, which are supposed to be unbreakable.
The whole thing now sounds very tempting.
But they are really unbreakable.
He has little desire to give up 40 euros now, only to be disappointed later.
In addition, he is wondering about the number of 25 x 622 on the racing bike.
There is also ( apparently ) a wider version of the Marathon Plus Reifen, but the majority is still narrower.
This is a problem.
or she would have preferred to ride on a racing horse rather than a riding horse.
The side of the swallow seems to be the absolute knowledge of the Durano DD. more.
Thanks already for the help and good wishes.

After the release of their new high--end broadbanders B 100 6 OHm, it was only a matter of time until the Solo Series also received new members.
The new Sprössling is called Solo 15 and it resembles the large predecessors with the B 200 – 6 OHm.
However, in this construction plan, a suitable design foot was included, with the loudspeaker placed in the correct position.
It has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The Solo 15 is well suited to people who have a relatively low maximum sound level, but the musical quality of the sound is very high.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is not able to produce such a large sound pressure level because it is unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the Solo 15 sounds weak.
On the other hand, they are enormous and for their size they are extremely impressive and accurate.
The Solo 15 was made with a slight high tone increase.
This is common among broadband users because the high frequencies are increasingly concentrated in order to optimize.
The Solo 15 is perfectly placed on the Hearing Place with a very clear and fine sound.
The high tone area is reduced and so the sound image is made warmer.
thanks to the point sound source, the individual components of a musical piece are located in an optimal stereodimensional sharp and precise manner.
The very low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHm cause a similar dynamics.
The Solo 15 complements not only the Solo Series, but also enlarges it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of his constructions, it is advisable to begin thinking about the final appearance of the loudspeaker, in order to make corresponding adjustments to the construction.
If, for example, the housing is to be furnished, the lowering of the loudspeakers must be adjusted accordingly, as the furnishing adds further material.
After all the plates had been cut,, a 8 mm hole was bored into the floor at the corresponding place to allow the cable to pass through easily later.
With the help of an upper frase, now the speaker opening in the front is made, so that the B 100 – 6 OHm can be used in the front completely.
From the back, this opening was to be fitted with a 45° angle to maximize the area of the speaker chassis.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHm have a break in the phase, as shown in the " detail phase " image.
After this, he begins the actual construction of the box and places one of the two sidewalls on a flat surface in front of him.
On these, the rear wall, the roof, the front and the floor are covered with plaster.
There were also to be used the three reinforcements and glued together.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in their material strength, if, for example, finished beams from the timber yard are used instead of 16 mm MDF beams produced by the company itself.
In the next stage, the second side is attached.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides and the front, follow.
By means of a suitable Lochkreissäge or a Forstnerbohrers, the placement of the holes for the bassreflexrohres, as well as the attachment of the back wall clamp is facilitated.
He then uses a circular saw to round all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the footplate can also be rounded.
In the following, the footplate is firmly attached to the base of the house by being cemented and additionally bolted with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre--drilling ( 2.5 mm drill ) of the attachment points of the speaker chassis and the attachment clamp.
After the Gehäuse of wood dust was cleaned, the cable laying began.
This is achieved by the 35 mm Bassreflex opening in the rear wall.
He then pulls the entire and uncut cable piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, leaving it there for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and left there loosely hanging.
Following this, the frequency changer is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the Frequenzweiche, as well as the corresponding attachment plan can be found in the construction manual for the Solo 15.
The frequency switcher was installed and the connection terminal was bolted, followed by the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box, which is not completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bassreflex opening and with some skill, it is possible to drop Heißkleber onto the opening and thus close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHm and with a small lamp, the sealing can be tested accordingly.
Then followed the damping, as described.
Then the B 100 – 6 OHm is connected to the B 100 – 6 OHm and is fastened to the B 100 – 6 OHm with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the positive cable ( marked cables ) at the positive pole of the speakers ( larger contact ) are tied.
At the end, the bass reflex tube is shortened to 28 mm ( the total length of the tube ) and inserted.
For the damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening of the bass reflex tunnel should be preserved.
He can also give an order now and begin delivering in June..

Finally, they can announce that they will also organize the Oscars again in this year.
It is because of well--known reasons that it is not possible to have more than four people in the studio at the same time, which means a higher planning effort and that the short notice of the announcement explains it.
There will be at least three people on the switch, so the Oscars 2021 will be broadcast with at least seven people on the switch and thousands of people watching it.
= They do their best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it is still a pandemic and they are doing everything they can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
~ 0:30 start.
They will start with cold drinks, plan a good meal and make themselves ready for a long, but very interesting night.
