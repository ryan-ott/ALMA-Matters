At the academic year conference of Zhejiang University, students sang the main role in presenting research results that made people's brains open wide - Xinhua News Agency.
Using air to wash one's hands, using one's mouth to diagnose a disease, and accurately searching for the source of smog, yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year Conference of the University of Zhejiang, a series of scientific achievements were awarded.
The main researcher of these achievements were all students, the research covered the fields of environment, mechanical engineering, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities education, and so on. The students started with a simple curiosity and created many high--end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards in China and abroad.
Biological sensors : his home doctor.
A team of doctoral students from the biomedical engineering department demonstrated a smartphone- sized biological sensor in real time.
"All he needs to do is to blow a small amount of air into the device, and it can detect the composition of the air he exhales and give a preliminary assessment of his health condition.. "
Zhang Tingming explained that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and that the health report will be displayed on the smartphone.
On the market, there is a smart ring that is able to detect the wearer's health status, generally measuring temperature, pulse and other physical parameters..
This set of biological sensors uses a new type of material, graphene, and its target is chemical elements. its acute sense of smell allows it to more deeply and accurately detect the state of a person's health.
Smart surgical light : the doctor's high energy eyes.
Besides the smartphone, the surgical room also used the smart surgical light..
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Inventions Exhibition.
The graduate student of the Department of Optoelectronic Sciences and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Zhu Yu Lin and Shen Jun Feng team discovered a new path in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented the smart LED surgical no-- shadow lamp.
"A lot of early- stage disease detection and surgical removal are not done properly, and this is related to the light used in the operating room. "
According to Shen Junfeng,, for example, when cancer is detected at an early stage, if the doctor is not able to see all of the cancerous tissue, then the cancerous cells will continue to spread..
This type of intelligent surgical light has four light discs, which can adjust the light spectrum to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light illumination.
During surgery, the surgeon can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness of the light, the light spectrum, the uniformity of color, and the lack of shadows according to the needs of the surgery and his own habits.
This type of smart surgical light has already been used in the affiliated hospitals of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine's affiliated Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine's affiliated Huashan Hospital, among other hospitals, and received positive feedback.
Last year in October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Using air to wash their hands: saving water and cool at the same time.
ordinary people wash their hands by simply splashing water on them, at most applying some soap, squeezing some hand sanitizer, and putting on a hand sanitizer dispenser. On the other hand, Li Bicheng and his peers have invented a hand-washing device that uses air.
Just by standing on the wash basin of the equipment, their body weight would compress the air and force it out.
"it's like a blow- up balloon.
The compressed air, at the water faucet, forms a flowing mixture of air and water.
This way, we can wash their hands clean. "
This method of hand washing has been proven to have the same effectiveness as hand washing with soap and water, by means of this method of hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on its own gravitational force as a driving force, while also ensuring cleanliness, it can save 90% of water, and the entire process is completely energy- efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among the world's top universities and was awarded the only gold medal..
please arrange to send it back to me as soon as possible, thanks.
Cancel the order and return the money, without points, and not to use PRS Organization in the future.

If so, it should be ordered as soon as possible.
There are none at the moment, thankfully.
He told me to tell them where he was #PRS Org #
I didn't want to wait, cancelled the order.

It's good, I'm sorry to bother him.
A very meaningful certificate - a first aid certificate.
This is the only one of his certificates that is more important to him than his driver's license.
To make it clear, the emergency first aid measures are actually emergency first aid measures to be carried out in the event of an emergency, i.e. before the arrival of the ambulance.
Everyone knows that in the process of the ambulance arriving at the scene of the accident, there is still a period of time,, and it is this period of time that is the most crucial..
This is the time when urgent help is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a stroke, a cerebral hemorrhage, a sudden stop in breathing, then his life's window was only four minutes and 40 seconds, the golden four minutes and 40 seconds.
So it is very important for the people around me to know how to give first aid..
When someone collapses in front of them, they can use their professional knowledge to try to revive him, rather than standing there in a state of helplessness, unable to do anything,, this feeling of helplessness is too scary.
"In China, official data shows that every year there are three million people who die unexpectedly, the most dangerous of which is heart failure..
In the United States, the national average is 15 percent that can be rescued.
In the Las Vegas gambling hotel, 78 percent of those rescued could be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing were below one percent. "
This was the first reaction of the founder of the first reaction, Liu Lei.
If a person's heart stops beating, their breathing stops and their heart stops beating, chest compressions are of no use.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compressions in order to bring the person back to life..
I find that there are still very few people who have this kind of awareness to study emergency first aid, but when a situation arises, they are not able to react in time. Therefore, it is still necessary to call on everyone to learn a little bit of this skill so that they are able to react immediately in the event of an emergency.
It may still be able to save one person's life.
First aid certificates can be obtained at their local Red Cross first aid training centers by registering at the Red Cross first aid training center in Pusan. Students are also eligible for discounts.
PS: the last picture is a record of his goal to complete before he turned 25 years old, which was to add the emergency first aid certificate to his list of goals, which he completed a few months ago.
Next, he plans to take other certificates he wants to take, he plans to take a scuba diving certificate, he saw a scuba diving emergency certificate in a small red book before, and it turns out that one must have an emergency certificate to be able to take a scuba diving certificate. Therefore, the emergency certificate is still very useful.
He ordered # # Number #.
The 13 rupee prawn dumpling is one of them.
I've never tried it.
# Name # does not write clearly.
one costs 13 euros.
Yesterday, # PRS Organization # sent the wrong meal, this time it was just one shrimp dumpling for me to eat..
Because, despite the fact that he previously entered code, he saw that it was effective.
To start with the conclusion, in my opinion, the movie " Four Seas " is a bad movie from all aspects.
However, the film itself is not a shining point either, and the choice of music is not as good as it could have been.
There are many types of bad films. falling asleep in a cinema hall while watching a film is one type, watching a film and being angered by it afterwards is another type. the film " Four Seas " is like a monkey on Mount Emei that can ignite the viewer's anger in many different ways.
When it comes to insulting the audience, no one is as talented as Tran Hong Nguyen.
The most painful thing about this film is that it is like a creature from a Cormac McCarthy novel, difficult to name, with many holes in it, like the skin of a small man, like the skin of a small man.
Even after watching it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor from the director, but when you think about it carefully, it turns out that it is in fact just a load of bullshit..
First of all, it is very difficult to understand some of the plot twists.
The male protagonist lives in a small island in the south, with his grandmother.
Her grandmother has a wish to see snow, and then the storyline arranges for a neighbor to drive her to the northeast to see snow.
An elderly person sits in a bread truck from the south to the northeast to see snow.
He and his father are still very relaxed about this.
Then this old man just disappeared..
opening a bar on a derelict ship, how the female protagonist's brother managed to get a liquor license.
The mountain road was turned into a closed road because of the actions of a small gang of hoodlums on the island.
The cement truck then stopped in the middle of the road and the cement truck driver couldn't find any of the cement truck drivers around.
This sense of theatricality is too obvious now.
A small--fry criminal with a bad record and suspicions of criminal activity who becomes a deputy police officer for some reason.
In the face of high--interest loans, why they didn't report to the police, in the film, the police officer specifically asked whether there was a difficult situation.
A grown-up person knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to use a room key to open the door of a dormitory, and then forcefully arranges to find the owner of the dormitory, sit outside the room door and sleep for a night..
This kind of nonsensical plotting pervades the entire film, because the plot is so nonsensical that, when he remembers it, he feels pained by it.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about the film is its main theme,, or rather, the fact that the film has no main theme at all, and is nothing more than a grotesque monstrosity.
At the beginning of the film, it seems that he wanted to make a comedy film, 20 minutes later, he may have wanted to make a motivational film. Halfway through the film, it seems that he wanted to make a drama about the life of a small- town youth. After watching the film, one does not even know what one has seen. This is followed by doubts about oneself, a feeling that one should not have gone to the cinema to watch the film in the first place. en:At the beginning of the film, it seems that he wanted to make a comedy film, 20 minutes later, he may have wanted to make a motivational film.

This is followed by doubts about oneself, a feeling that one should not have gone to the cinema to watch the film in the first place.
For the most part, people are already very familiar with the formula of most films, for example, a film about a motorcycle racer would be about an underdog who overcomes adversity to achieve success.
If he wants to make a romantic film, he just has to tell the story of a young man from a small town who falls in love with a waitress.
If he wants to depict the real world, then at the very least, his plot should not contain things that go against the norm of the real world.
(e.g. the character played by Ajit Vadakayil, the new motorcycle, which was burnt, but still able to sing a song) cannot open some holes in the brain, like the one that Pankaj Mishra's character looked at.
As for the female lead, she is not a weak- minded person, but in some ways she behaves like a 5- year old child, and I don't know whether it is due to her acting skills or the director's request.
There is also one thing that I can't quite figure out: why, as a race car driver,, Håkan Nørgaard is so enthusiastic about adding crash scenes to his own films..
The film's release during the Spring Festival holidays is a clear indication that the film's makers are trying to give audiences a hard time.

Check井 lining concrete block production and processing equipment in Zhengzhou.
The city of Zhengzhou is the home of China's concrete inspection shaft molding machine, concrete inspection shaft block molding machine, concrete inspection shaft wall molding machine, and concrete inspection shaft wall molding machine. The company is a manufacturer of concrete inspection shaft molding machines, concrete inspection shaft block molding machines, concrete inspection shaft wall molding machines, and concrete inspection shaft wall molding machines from semi--automated to fully automated production lines.
After years of practice and development, it has now become capable of producing high- quality inspection shafts, mobile inspection shafts, fully automated inspection shafts, and other inspection shaft equipment and accessories.
Checking out the equipment for the production and assembly of the reinforced concrete masonry units (RCMU) at the site in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China.
The equipment for the production and manufacture of concrete moulds for inspection chambers. The characteristics and advantages of the equipment for the production and manufacture of concrete moulds for inspection chambers in Zhengzhou.
The masonry block machine is widely used in the construction of underground structures for coal, heat, water, electricity and gas, and is a new type of masonry construction material.
e.g. all types of inspection wells for drainage and water storage facilities, rainwater outlets, ditches, septic tanks and small--scale constructions such as bridge wing walls.
The advantage of using prefabricated concrete blocks to build a drainage inspection shaft is that the four sides of the blocks have a concave and convex groove structure, which, when combined, form a chain lock.
The masonry walls of the dam are much more resistant to shear forces than the masonry walls of the embankment.
The module is made of a hollow structure, when assembled, the vertical holes are connected and the horizontal holes are connected, after the core is filled with concrete, a network of reinforced concrete is formed, which serves as a second strengthening and waterproofing purpose.
Both the longitudinal and the transverse reinforcing bars are set in the module, and the longitudinal and the transverse reinforcing bars correspondingly increase the structural strength of the entire structure.
In addition, the use of concrete- reinforced concrete inspection and drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage d
The concrete inspection shaft module molding machine is equipped with a smart control system that includes a data input and output device, a one--button touch screen, a liquid crystal display surveillance machine, an automated analysis of the ratio of the mixture and density, a safety logic control system, and a fault diagnosis system.
The boulder wall body molding machine uses a single piston hydraulic system and a double piston hydraulic system.
The independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the impact of the main machine vibrations on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection shaft mold module brick machine equipment bale box track advancing mold box lid closure, automatic feeding pallet, all of which are done by the hydraulic system independently, thus reducing the wear and tear and maintenance of the machinery.
The concrete inspection shaft module molding machine uses imported computer and electrical equipment, seals, hydraulic components, which ensures that the overall performance of the machine is stable and reliable.
The walls of the bunker are made of a single plate of steel, the surface of which is cut with a line of cuts, and there are no welded joints between the plates. This makes it possible for the bunker to move freely in the direction it is supposed to move, which reduces mechanical wear and tear.
The mold pressure is reduced, the filler is added, and the two are combined into one to reduce the amplitude of the vibrations and ensure that the vibrations achieve the desired effect.
The wall of a mine shaft is made up of a modular body of a machine that vibrates mechanically or electrically, controlled by a computer, which adjusts the amplitude of the vibrations according to the nature of the raw material, and which does not wear out the brakes, thus prolonging the service life and reducing the cost.
The walls of the mine shaft are made of a modular wall body machine with automatic and manual control.

The Chongqing vocational school pilot for modern apprenticeship entered the workforce as soon as they enrolled - Xinhua News Agency.
Yesterday, a reporter from the city education bureau learned that from this year onwards, 60 secondary vocational schools in the city will try out the " modern apprenticeship " model of talent training, which will allow students to be both apprentices and students at the same time, and after they graduate, they will be recruited as employees by the companies that have pre--registered them.
The Beijing Education Commission demanded that the standardize the recruitment and acceptance of students at vocational schools and the hiring of workers by enterprises. The dual identity of students at vocational schools and workers at enterprises should be made clear, the recruitment and acceptance of students at vocational schools and the hiring of workers by enterprises should be done in accordance with the principle of mutual selection, a three--way agreement should be signed between the student, the school and the enterprise, and a four- way agreement should be signed between the student, the guardian, the school and the enterprise if the student is 16 years old or older but not yet 18 years old. The student, the guardian, the school and the enterprise should sign a three- way agreement to determine the rights and responsibilities of each party, as well as the details of the student's on- the job training.
To encourage the trial schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre--employment training and transfer training.
The pilot schools should reform their way of cultivating talents.
the college and the company jointly designed a curriculum for the cultivation of human resources, jointly formulated professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, positions, masters, quality control standards and corresponding implementation guidelines.
The trial period is based on the student's internship time, which is determined according to the university's curriculum. the internship period usually lasts for six months..
In the practice of the enterprise, the enterprise should implement the management model of the in--house apprenticeship. according to the characteristics of the different professions, one master could lead 2 to 5 apprentices and form a study group, ensuring that the apprentices would be able to master the skills required for each of the rotational positions.
According to an arrangement, from 2016 to 2019 August, the city established three batches of 60 modern vocational high school apprenticeship trial points, with each trial point having 50 or more apprentices and a total of 3,000 apprentices to be trained.
In accordance with the principle of starting with a pilot and then rolling it out to the rest of the country, from point to point, gradually rolling it out, the principle of establishing a school- industry recruitment, training and education partnership, a one--stop education and training mechanism that is long- lasting, will be explored and established, and efforts will be made to increase the number of graduates who find employment and the quality of their employment.

A South African doctor says the Omicron variant is highly contagious but tends to cause mild illness.
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those of the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to a report by the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus in South Africa, the spread of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus in South Africa's Limpopo province, a group of 5,000 doctors in the province reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, symptoms similar to those of the flu.
The group's chief medical officer, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pile said: " they can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days. "
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more susceptible to severe illness from a coronavirus infection.
He said, in contrast, in the previous wave of the Delata infection, the patients he treated with new coronary pneumonia " had difficulty breathing and low levels of oxygen in their blood.
Many people are admitted to the hospital within a few days.
In the first two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect sufficient data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) summary, only 30% of the hospitalized new coronavirus patients were severely ill, which is half of the proportion of severe illness in the first wave of the epidemic. The average length of hospital stay was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days. Only 3% of the hospitalized new coronavirus patients died, while in the first wave of the epidemic in South Africa, 20 % of the patients died.
The director of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports saying, "at the moment, all signs point to this being a relatively mild disease. "
He also said: "It is still early days and we need to get more data.
Normally, hospitalization and death occur later, and the time of entering this wave of the epidemic is only two weeks.. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still the world's most prevalent strain of the new coronavirus, cases of Omicron have been reported in more than 30 countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the province saw a 400% increase in new cases in the first week of December, tests showed that 90% of the cases were caused by the Omicron variant.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes were all sent out.

Election time assessment: what it takes to rescue kidnapped children.
If the class- comparison "there is no buying and selling, there is no killing" of the famous public welfare advertisement slogan, then, in the absence of " trafficking " demand, in a favorable environment, group prevention and group punishment, and all-- citizen anti- trafficking, this type of crime would not be profitable, dangerous, and costly, so it would not occur frequently.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency platform for the dissemination of information on missing children.
This is for establishing a reliable channel for releasing information on missing children and for quickly locating children who have been kidnapped.
Hearing the name of this app as " circle of friends " makes one feel warm.
The new technological means are not only called "artistic" but are also informationized in a way that is appropriate, practical and effective.
The main objective of kidnapping law enforcement is to recover kidnapped children, to protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, to social prevention and law education, can be listed with many " big words " 。
However, before the child trafficking case is solved, the safety of the victim's person should be prioritized.
In the face of the urgency of the "search for rescue" mission, matters such as "whether kidnapped children should be subject to the death penalty" and other controversial topics can be put on the back burner for the time being. But the rescue of kidnapped children, for example, should not be discussed.
According to the experience of investigating this type of case, human traffickers are accustomed to quickly leaving the scene of the crime.
Every minute that the search and rescue operation is delayed, the distance between the child and his or her parents may increase by one step, and the difficulty of solving the case may also increase by one step..
In this case, the use of such a direct method as the " Bumiputera Batak Nusantara " platform is actually an effective way to solve the case and find the missing children.
In the end,, " recovering " is a task that requires the entire law enforcement system to work well.
Crimes must be prevented, the rights of children and their parents must be protected, from legislation to the judiciary and law enforcement, all of which must be carried out in accordance with the principle of "protecting the weak and helpless".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking from the family to the society can still be improved.
For example, a common case is a family of three at a train station taking a break, the parents sleeping and waking up only to find that the child is missing..
One cannot expect a two- year old child to have enough self- protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, one should at least have the same level of protection awareness.
The parents take turns to rest, or the child is placed under the protection of a safe place, are the most basic measures to prevent children from being kidnapped.
From the other side of the police's fight against child trafficking, the other side of the buying of kidnapped children should also be looked at and punished.
A single act of wrongdoing is often only one link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the minimum punishment for kidnapping and selling children is 5 years, and the maximum punishment is the death penalty, with confiscation of property.
The crime of child trafficking, which is on the rise in the trend of "lightening the punishment", is obviously a crime that is punished more severely.
To this day, there are still many cases of child trafficking..
It can be seen that some people's views on raising children are outdated and their legal awareness is thin..
The law and order education of this part of the population should keep pace.
In order to effectively control the crime of child trafficking, it is not enough to rely solely on the strict enforcement of official regulations.
If the " market " for kidnapping is widespread, the kidnappers' greed will drive them to constantly invent new kidnapping techniques, creating a situation of " law enforcement vs. law enforcement " that will inevitably lead to low-- effectiveness operations.
As a result, the elimination of outdated notions, the popularization of legal common sense also helps to eradicate child trafficking and child prostitution.
