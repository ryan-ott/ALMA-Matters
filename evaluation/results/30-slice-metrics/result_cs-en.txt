Slavia promised Berbrovi a million for the title, Tvrdik denied it.
In the current corruption case, it was alleged that the former president of the Football Association of Romania, Roman Berbr had received a million korun from Slavia for the league title in the 2018-19 season.
It was reported by the football newspaper, efotbal, that it had received parts of the police's files.
The president of the club, Jaroslav Tvrdik, said that there was no corruption in the club.
The server revealed police audio recordings in which Slavia's former sporting director, Jan Nezmar,, who left the club in the summer of 2011, was a central figure.
The former influential member of the Communist Party was in frequent contact with both Berbrem and the former sports director of the second division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogozem,, who is involved in the case.
Criminalists apparently worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi promised financial compensation for winning the title.
In 2019, Slavia won the first league title.
The police organization was informed that after the victory in the league,, Roman ( Berbr ) was given a one million euro bonus from the Slavia club officials.
On the day after,, according to the criminalists,, Berbr also met with Nejmare and the president of the Slavie Tvrdiik football club.
The information from the report is still unknown, whether the police are still using this information.
Tvrdic rejected all forms of corruption.
In the years 2015 to 2017, they actively tried to change the structure of Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
Tvrdic said that the club had not been involved in any illegal activity, that they had not attempted to influence the decisions of the referees and that the club had not received any financial compensation in relation to the incident.
In contrast, Nesmari and some other former players of Slavia have also criticized Tvirdi..
In November 2005, a police raid on several locations, including the FAČR headquarters, took place.
The most prominent figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football activities.
In the middle of January, the former director of Vashehrad, Rogoz, was released from custody.

Velezrada is a type of coup in which the president of the republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It should have been more serious.
As a result of the pandemic, the number of people between 35 and 35 years old has increased, who have no sex throughout the year.
More and more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
The main focus is on the religiously based people of the Daily Mail.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of people between 35 and 45 years old who were sexually active decreased from 8 to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35, who said that the number of sexual encounters in the last year was more than in the previous year.
The decline in the number of sexually active individuals is also influenced by other factors, revealed by a survey conducted by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them is the economic impact of the epidemic of the coronavirus and the higher percentage of unemployment.
It was also possible that the presence of media and social media, or video, which made sex less important and more of a secondary priority for young people.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who have had no sex in the previous year has increased. "
In married couples, sexual activity is more frequent and in 2021, only 5 % of them stated that they had not been sexually active in the previous year.
In the age of 35, 29 % of married couples. Stone added that marriage in the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also due to the fear of the pre-marital relationship and the religious background.
However, in married couples, it is more likely that the husband is sexually active, that the percentage of married couples aged between 35 and 35 is still decreasing.
Young people' s view of premarital sex is divided, about 30 % believe that it is a bad thing and about 70 % believe that it is normal.
"The truth is that between the 30 percent of free individuals in this age group, there is a minority, but their behavior is moving in the direction of the 30 percent. "
The majority of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex are motivated by their religious beliefs.
Since 2008, the number of young people between 35 and 40 years of age who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to more than 60 percent.
Among the " less believers " the trend rose from 10 to 20 % .
The decline of sexual activity is also influenced by other factors,, such as less social interaction and mainly alcohol consumption during the period of the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex was lower among people without jobs or with lower incomes.
The second reason is the expansion of the digital media, which is likely to reduce the need for sex.
People tend to spend more time on the internet, as a result of which this need is replaced.
This trend was most pronounced during the lockdown during the period of the pandemic of the coronavirus.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, it is necessary to force a part of the population to behave in a way that they do not want,, but which can save their lives.

From these statistics, it is clear that the vast majority of unvaccinated old people belong to the second group, which means that they are able to take care of themselves.
