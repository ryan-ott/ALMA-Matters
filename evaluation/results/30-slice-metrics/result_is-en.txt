eftier she left Iceland, she became acquainted with international relations with the Army War College.
The 16 months between the resignation of predecessor Van Voorst and the arrival of his successor in September 2010.
Það may have been partly due to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador but then resigned.
In the course of his career, Lous Ariega had worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for more than a decade.
He resigned in 2013 and took up the post of ambassador in Guatemala.
Þá he took over as ambassador for a second term.
The United States had no ambassador in the country for 13 months after Robert Barber was appointed in January 2015.
Barber was politically appointed but was not a diplomat, rather he had worked as a lawyer and was a supporter of Barack Obama's campaign.
20 January 2017, he left his post as ambassador to the United States and was succeeded by Donald Trump.
Stjørn Trump was unusually slow to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the Washington government.
Því it took two years for the United States Congress to appoint Jeffrey Ross Gunter to the post of ambassador to Iceland.

is 2019, Gunter became the first British ambassador to return to Ireland since 2010.
The reason for this is both the length of time that it took to nominate people to key positions and the length of time it took to confirm ambassadors.
2009 to 2014, the number of ambassadors in Iceland has been around 50.
is Það has not prevented the establishment of new headquarters for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which opened in 2009 at the Engjateig site.
Framkvæmds are said to have cost around 6.5 million euros, and the walls and roof were reinforced with bulletproof steel and bulletproof glass in all the windows.
Það seems that it has not been able to fulfill the current ambassador's sense of security because he is said to be afraid of his life and has asked to be armed.

1974, laws were established on the basis of these agreements and the labor union continued to grow after that.
It was not the only radical change that the labour movement of the 20th century achieved through its struggle for wages.
The strikes of 1955 were marked by similar successes in the struggle for wage rights and sickness benefits, as well as reductions in working hours, and improvements in housing conditions.
e of these rights were hard to win and cost a lot of struggle, but proved to be more lasting and permanent than the increase in wages in the wage struggle, which disappeared as quickly as the boom of the 1960s and 1970s, which characterized the period after the war and until the 1990s.
The beginning of the establishment of the general welfare funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Þo men came together in the end to agree that the workers' unions were in reality owned by the employers and that the union leaders were to be appointed by both employers and workers.

Þetta is all replayed here as the introduction to the newest form of government in Iceland, " shadow government " .
Þar where the word is used in the language, it is not clear that it has been defined to the end, but it seems that the following definition is " the most taken " . A shadow leader is when the leader of a trade union says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the union to the board of the welfare fund in order to take a stand on a particular issue.
Ef they fail to follow the orders, they are killed and removed from the government at the first opportunity.
Ef the foremost man does not use this in the media and does not talk about resignation, but it is not a " shadow government " because such relations exist between people in the financial world as well as in other places.
is..E.g. lets the reader to think that there are more than one way to reach the end of the story.
e were the two men who tried to shape this definition when it was written on the morning of 25 July 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a reporter for the Freetimes newspaper and Ásgeir Jónsson, Secretary of the State Bank.
Tilefni of this was the announcement by Icelandair CEO Bogi Nils Bogason that he was planning to terminate the airline's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants ( saying that they would be fired and Ragnar Þór Ingolffsen, chairman of the Verslunarmannafelag of Reykjavik sent out the message to the union's representatives in the board of the Lifeyrissjød of Reykjavik that they would not support the possibility of the union 's takeover of the airline 's share in the company.
Nokkru later,, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and in the wake of this, Ragnar Thore also reversed his decision.
The two men, Hörður and Ásgeir, saw a reason to speak about the matter in the Sunday edition of the Freetimes newspaper with large words about the shadow government, the violation of the law and the need for changes to the law.

The CEO of Icelandair was clearly on thin ice when he decided to lay off a large part of the workforce and thereby weakened the company's position against the owners of the airline.
