India's PM to attend temple groundbreaking at disputed site
New Delhi ( AP - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend a groundbreaking ceremony next month for a Hindu temple on a disputed site in northern India where a 16th century mosque was torn down by Hindu hardliners in 1992.
The ceremony is set for Aug. 5, a date organizers said was astrologically auspicious for Hindus but that also marked a year since the Indian Parliament revoked the semi-autonomous status of its only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir.
The symbolism was impossible to miss for both supporters and opponents of Modi 's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP, whose manifesto had for decades included pledges to strip restive Kashmir 's autonomy and to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram where the Mughal era mosque once stood, a site in the city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh state that devotees believe to be Ram 's birthplace .
The ceremony was broadcast live on state television and the number of participants and spectators was limited, according to the Vishwa Hindu Parashtam, or the World Hindu Organization,, a Hindu nationalist group allied with the BJP.
The temple will serve as " an enduring and immortal beaming center of social harmony, national unity and integration and awakening of the feeling of Hindutva " or Hindu way of life, the organization's spokesperson Vinod Bansal said in a news release Saturday .
A century-long dispute over the site was resolved last year following the BJP 's landslide election victory.
In November, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the temple trust, saying that Muslim petitions would be given five acres at an alternative site.
Hindus hardliners have long contended that Mughal Muslim invaders built a mosque on top of a preexisting temple in the ancient city of Ayodya.
A December 1992 riot following the destruction of the mosque sparked communal violence in which about 2,000 people were killed, mostly Muslims.
The trial in the demolition court case continues to be heard in a special court.
An architect from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Modi's home state, has proposed a towering sandstone structure 161 feet (49 meters ) high with five domes.
Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh 's chief minister and a Hindu monk, requested that Ayodhya hold a special cleaning and purification ceremony and for all of the city 's temples to light oil lamps ahead of Modi 's visit, the Press Trust of India news agency reported .
Adityanath said the occasion marked the end of a " 500 year struggle "

According to KCNA, a person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that divides the two Koreas with symptoms that suggested Covid 19.
" An emergency event happened in Kaesong city where a runaway who went to the south three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus returned on 19 July after illegally crossing the demarcation line "
KCNA did not specifically mention whether the individual had been tested, but said an " uncertain result was made from several medical checkups of the secretion of that person's upper respiratory organ and blood " prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.
North Korea has received thousands of coronavirus testing kits from Russia and other countries and imposed strict border closures.
Thousands of people in the secretive nation were quarantined, but restrictions had recently eased.
In recent weeks, North Korea has also stepped up a campaign criticising defectors to South Korea as " human scum " and calling for South Korea to crack down on groups that send propaganda messages and food aid into the North.
en. Kim ordered an investigation into the military units along the border where the person was suspected of crossing to " administer a severe punishment and take necessary measures "

Kudlow 's comments come after a week where the White House 's hoped for payroll tax cuts were shot down by Congress .
Kudlow said on CNN's " State of the Union " that he would have preferred a payroll tax cut on top of the $1200 check.
"But, be that as it may, politically, it doesn't work.
The new relief package is expected to be funded by the Department of Defense, the Department of the Navy, the Department of the Air Force, the Department of the Army and the Department of the Marine Corps.
On ending the additional $600 in unemployment benefits the federal government was supplying, Kudlow argued that the extra money was hurting small businesses from hiring workers.

Mnuchin said, " It is a little more bluntly on " Fox News Sunday " that " workers and Americans understand the concept that they should not be paid more to stay at home than to work " .
Mnuchin said the new bill will provide additional unemployment benefits and noted that it would be less than the payments issued under the CAares Act.
He said some workers were collecting more than they earned on the job.
As a result, when businesses were reopening some employees did not have an incentive to return to work.
The secretary said the Trump administration and Senate Republicans are on the same page with a $1 trillion package, but noted that in the interest of passing a bill quickly, issues that are more difficult to negotiate with Democrats could be held off for another bill .
Police try new, less lethal tools as protests continue.
As violent clashes continue between law enforcement and protesters in Portland and around the country, debate is swirling around how police can cut back on lethal force.
Some companies are stepping up to offer new high-tech tools like remote handcuffs for police to use instead of the more dangerous options like pepper spray, rubber bullets and flash grenades.
In the 125 incidents of excessive force documented by Amnesty International, 100 of the 125 incidents occurred in 20 states and the District of Columbia, and 25 of the 125 incidents occurred in 20 states and the District of Columbia.
" It was a misuse of tear gas, pepper spray, pepper balls and 40 millimeter impact rounds, basically every combination of less lethal weapons being used in inappropriate ways. "
In this case, the gun is used as a deterrent against intruders, as well as a means of defense against intruders.
" All of these devices should be at hand for the cops to use other than deadly physical force being used by a firearm because it ' s the only profession in America where the citizens give them the right to take their life " said Corey Pegues, former New York Police Department Deputy Inspector.

United and Chelsea into the Champions League and Bournemouth and Watford relegated from the Premier League.
Manchester United and Chelsea qualified for the Champions League at the expense of Leicester on a frantic final day of the Premier League season on Sunday while Bournemouth and Watford were relegated to end five year stays in the top flight.
United won 2-0 at Leicester through goals by Bruno Fernandes and Jesse Lingard to give Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 's team a third place finish.
Chelsea beat Wolverhampton 2-0 after a goal and an assist by Mason Mount and finished in the fourth and final Champions League qualifying place above Leicester, which has been in the top four for most of the season.
Leicester, instead, will play in the Europa League along with Tottenham, which drew 1-1 at Crystal Palace to secure sixth place - above Wolverhamton on goal difference.
The battle to avoid the two remaining relegation places went to the wire as Aston Villa scored in the 84th minute, conceded a minute later and then held on for a 1-1 draw at West Ham to survive.
The goal came in the 10th minute of the game and was the first goal of the season for the club.
Bournemouth did what it had to do and beat Everton, 3-1, but ended up one point behind Villa.
Watford was also relegated as the next to last team after losing 3 – 2 at Arsenal.
Manchester City passed 100 goals for the campaign with a 5-0 win over last place and already demoted Norwich, a game that marked the last in the Premier League for David Silva after 10 years with City.
Kevin De Bruyne got a record tying 20th assist of the season and also scored twice.
Liverpool ended its title winning season with a 3-1 win at Newcastle and finished on a club record 99 points.
Southampton beat Sheffield United 3 - 1, with Danny Ings scoring his 22nd goal of the season.
The Golden Boot is awarded to the player with the most goals in the league.
Watford relegated from Premier League as Aubameyang fires Arsenal win
It is the first time in the history of the club that a player has been sacked in the middle of a match.
The whistle had just blowed on their five years in the Premier League and nobody could say that, when the occasion demanded them to hurl the kitchen sink at Arsenal, they went down without a fight.
This was a performance full of the crispness, urgency and aggression that have hallmarked their best work over the last half decade but it came too late, as did the fightback that almost completely overhauled a three goal deficit on the day.

In the end they fell short and their caretaker manager, Hayden Mullins, might reflect that he would have never been handed this most thankless of tasks if his team had shown comparable application previously.
Across the season they have not been good enough, but then nor has the organisation that employs them.
One poor campaign may not wreck an empire, but nor do the foundations put in place by the Pozzo family offer any kind of guarantee they will sail straight back up from the second tier.
It is hard to escape the sense that Watford 's habit of flipping managers has run out of road.
They are the 12th permanent appointment in eight years and there is only so much fresh air a new broom can sweep in .
Troy Deeney faces up to relegation despite getting on the scoresheet at the Emirates..
Players will depart, Ismaïla Sarr showing again that it would be inconceivable he would be playing Championship football in September, and a steady hand would be a priority.
There was nothing stable about the boom-or-bust fare in an encounter Mikel Arteta described as " a bit of a basketball game ," although it certainly made for fine entertainment .
Arteta said afterwards Watford's forwards had been " cheating " although he quickly clarified that as a football term for " gambling and staying up front " .
They certainly needed to play catch-up. The suggestion of a batting point was quickly scotched and they wondered how things would have transpired if they had not been obliged to play catch-up.
en Instead they conceded a penalty almost immediately.
40 seconds later, Craig Dawson had bundled carelessly into Alexandre Lacazette, but it took VAR almost three minutes to be confident of awarding the spot kick, which Pierre- Emerick Aubameyang dispatched unfussily.
Watford gathered themselves to press relentlessly, with Sarr in electric form on the right, and came close through Roberto Pereyra and Troy Deeney .
But then Aubameyang teed up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager teeing up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager teeing up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager teeing up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager teeing up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager teeing up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager teeing up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks
Aubameyang then controlled Tierney's long throw and converted a masterful overhead kick that left him one goal short of the golden boot, an award he would have shared with Jamie Vardy if Ben Foster had not blocked one last chance near the end .
Watford appeared done for but they persevered and, after David Luiz had produced another rash penalty-area challenge for the album on Welbeck, Deeney rammed in his own penalty before the break .
Deeney, walking wounded for most of the season, hauled himself around the pitch and was in gladiator mode throughout .
He would probably have gobbled up the chance Adam Masina missed early in the second period and further openings were spurned.
Welbeck was thwarted for a first time by the excellent Martínez, who Arteta confirmed will start Saturday 's FA Cup final and then had the entire Watford contingent pitchside on their feet upon converting a fizzing cross from Sarr.
But Watford's prospects faded when his next effort was repelled and the soul-searching, from top to bottom, will need to be extensive.
The world's economy will be permanently changed by the outbreak of Covid 19.
Virus screening is likely to become part of their life, just like security measures became ubiquitous after 9 / 11.
It is important to invest in the infrastructure necessary to detect future viral outbreaks.
This investment protects economies in case immunity to Covid-19 turns out to be temporary.

This policy keeps workers employed at reduced hours and pay, with the government compensating some of the shortfall in wages.
By keeping matches between firms and workers intact, the economy is better prepared for a quick recovery.
It is important to improve the implementation of these policies and make them a permanent part of their economic recovery tool kit.
This is likely to become more common.
I had some evidence that working from home was at least as productive as working at the office.

The pandemic crisis has accelerated the pace of digital transformation, with further expansion in e-commerce and increases in the pace of adoption of telemedicine, videoconferencing and online teaching and fintech.
Companies with international supply chains are dealing with shortages and bottlenecks.
They are likely to see many of these companies reshore some of their production.
This trend will not create many jobs because most of the production is likely to be automated.
Goverments will be bigger after playing the role of insurer and investor of last resort during the crisis.
The public debt will balloon, creating financial challenges around the world.
The most important lesson from the Covid-19 pandemic is the importance of working together on problems that affect the entire human race.
They are much stronger united than divided.

Priti Patel has demanded an explanation from Twitter and Instagram over the length of time it took to remove " abhorrent " posts made by Wiley.
Police are currently investigating a series of antisemitic comments posted on the Grime artist 's social media accounts.
The Home Secretary tweeted on Sunday : " The antisemitic posts from Wiley are abhorrent "
" They have not been able to remain on Twitter and Instagram for so long and they have been asked to give a full explanation. "
" It is the responsibility of the media companies to act much faster to remove such appalling hatred from their platforms. "
In 2010, Wiley was accused of " ignoring antisemitism " as his tweets were still visible 12 hours after they were first posted.
A number of tweets have since been removed and the 41 year old has been issued a seven day ban by the site.
The 18- year old Wiley was arrested in 2008 for assaulting a police officer, was convicted in 2009 for assaulting a police officer, was convicted in 2009 for assaulting a police officer and was convicted in 2009 for assaulting a police officer.

Wiley's management company, A- List Management " cut all ties " with the star.
The artist 's now former manager, John Woolf, who is Jewish, wrote on Twitter : " Following Wiley 's antisemitic tweets today , @ A ' List MGMT have cut all ties with him .  There is no place in society for antisemitism . "
He had earlier said he did not support or condone what Wiley posted but that he would speak to him privately and " help educate him "
In a video on Instagram, Wiley appeared to say it was him who had cut ties with his management.
Other MPs criticised Twitter for allowing the tweets to remain visible.
2019 was the best year for the Labour Party since 1997.
"Just seen all the Wiley stuff.  We have @ Twitter left up such blatant antisemitism and hatred.  It hits all the dangerous beats, Jews get things they don't get, they are in control and they think they are better.  This is dangerous stuff.  Surely it should come down

He said that the tweets " showed that the law needs to be changed to hold them to reasonable account " .
The Campaign Against Antisemitism asked police to investigate Wiley's content and called on his social media accounts to be shut down " to prevent further outpouring of anti--Jewish venom " .
Wiley, known as the Godfather of Grime and whose real name is Richard Cowie, received an MBE for services to music in 2018.
Travellers from Spain told to quarantine.
Travellers arriving in the UK from Spain must now quarantine for 14 days under new coronavirus travel rules.
They were announced on Saturday following a spike in coronavirus cases in Spain, with more than 900 new cases of the virus reported on Friday.
Spanish officials have also warned a second wave could be imminent as major cities have seen cases surge.
British Airways have criticised the new measures as "yet another blow " to British holidaymakers.
People currently on holiday in Spain have been advised by the Department of Transport to follow the local rules and return home as normal and to check the Foreign Office's travel advice website for further information.
The Foreign Office is advising against all but essential travel to mainland Spain, however the quarantine measures apply to those returning from mainland Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, such as Majorca and Ibiza.
Foreign Office advice has ramifications for travel insurance.
He has been forced to cancel his holiday and return to the UK.
He is expected to continue his trip as planned and isolate in line with guidance on his return..
Quarantine measures for UK travellers were first introduced in early June.
But after pressure from the aviation and travel industries, the government and devolved administrations published lists of countries exempt from the rules.
British Airways said it was " disappointed " about the latest changes to the government 's travel advice and rules, although the airline said its flights were continuing to operate.
It said the move was " throwing thousands of Britons ' travel plans into chaos " .
The AOA said that the new measures would " further damage what is already a fragile restart of the aviation sector which continues to face the biggest challenge in its history "
The UK's biggest tour operator, Tui, cancelled its flights due to depart to mainland Spain and the Canary Islands on Sunday.
This means that passengers who are currently on holiday are able to return on their intended flight home.
However, budget airline EasyJet said it was " disappointed " and would operate a full schedule in the coming days.
The company said in a statement that passengers who no longer want to travel can transfer their flights without a change fee or receive a voucher for the value of the booking.
A spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents ( Abta ) said the government ' s quarantine rule change was " disappointing " .
He also said that the government was considering lifting the quarantine rules for flights to and from certain regions with lower infection rates, or to places such as the Balearic Islands or the Canaries - which are geographically distinct from mainland Spain - to avoid further damage to the UK inbound and outbound tourism industries.
Spain has so far seen more than 28,000 coronavirus deaths.
On Thursday, it saw the biggest daily increase in infections since its lockdown ended.
It is the latest region to crack down on nightlife.
The wealthy north--east region, which is home to Barcelona, ordered all nightclubs to close for two weeks and put a midnight curfew on bars in the greater Barcelona area.
The BBC's Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid says contagion among young people is a particular worry, as they have been gathering in large numbers in cities at night.
France has warned its citizens not to travel to Catalonia while Norway has said it will start quarantining people arriving from Spain.
The government is urging employers to be "understanding of those returning from Spain who now will need to self-isolate.
But Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas- Symonds called for the government to explain in detail how it would support those affected, adding that the news would be " deeply concerning for families who are in caught in Spain or are planning travel "
The decision was made after reviewing the latest data earlier on Saturday..
" This reinforces the point that these matters are subject to change at short notice and so his advice is to be cautious about non-essential foreign travel "
He was killed in the bombing.
But the new rules mean he has had to cancel, for fears his wife 's employer would not be able to accommodate her taking an extra two weeks off to quarantine on their return .
He said he thought it was unlikely they would get a refund for the flight, as it has not been cancelled.
" I'm devastated " he told the BBC.
" I has family in Spain who have not seen their only grandkids since Christmas "
She told the BBC that she had planned to fly to Seville to surprise her boyfriend for his 30th birthday, and that she had planned to fly out on Sunday, but now feels that she cannot travel.
I 'm a keyworker and a teacher, and her boyfriend has work commitments so they cannot quarantine for 14 days when they return.
" We can't get any money back and to change the company want double what he has already paid in fees.
I 'm very disappointed and upset as they 're packed and ready to go.
Threats to Australian democracy are closer to home than China.
In 2009, the Commonwealth Parliament passed a law that allows the police to arrest and detain a person for a period of 24 hours without any evidence of a crime.
They include a roll out of facial recognition technology, forcing technology companies to decrypt information held on their customers ' computer systems, forcing technology companies to provide access to their customers ' cloud- based information without notification to the owner of the information and extending ASIO ' s compulsory questioning powers.
The ASIO Bill is particularly worrying.
Unlike any of the other Five Eyes countries – United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand – in the wake of September 11, ASIO was given power to compulsorily question people for up to seven days in relation to terrorism offences.

It is hard to imagine more " sweeping and vague " national security legislation " than this.
Asio would be allowed to compulsorily question anyone about these things - not just suspected offenders.
This includes journalists, business people, university academics and staff, lawyers, citizens, residents and visitors.
Asio would only have to show that the questioning would " substantially contribute to the collection of intelligence " about foreign interference, which seems to be the main target of the bill.
The person could then be questioned for up to 40 hours ( not including breaks ) .
If the person refused to attend, they were arrested.
Refusal to answer or giving false or misleading answers would carry a maximum five year sentence.
Rules that are fundamental in their legal systems - indeed protected by the constitution in the United States - are overturned by this bill.
People - including people already facing charges - will be compelled to provide evidence that may then be used to prosecute them.
They could have a lawyer present, but the lawyer would be confined to clarifying questions that were ambiguous or unclear.
The new bill transfers the decision to issue a questioning warrant from a judge to the Attorney General.
The Inspector General of Intelligence and Security pointed out that this " departs from the trend for increased requirements for external authorisation in other Five Eyes jurisdictions "
It also breaches the separation of powers principle that courts scrutinise the actions of executive government.
The new bill also proposes to expand the questioning power to children who are at least 14 years old, but only to those engaged or likely to engage in activities prejudicial to the protection of Australia and people from politically motivated violence.

We stand alone.
No other Five Eyes country goes so far, not even for terrorism offences.
Genuinely liberal democracies guard against authoritarian measures.
The conduct of their security agencies in relation to the bugging of the East Timor parliament, the trials of Witness K and Bernard Collaery, the secret trial and imprisonment of a former intelligence officer, the recent search warrants executed on two journalists and the prospect of charges against one of them in relation to stories on suspected murders by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan show that they should not be lowering their guard.
The number of cases of coronavirus in Israel has reached 60,000 as the number of infections has increased.
The number of people to test positive for coronavirus in Israel topped 60,000 on Saturday as the government struggles to contain a resurgence in infection rates .
The latest daily tally showed 1,770 new infections, bringing the total number of cases to 60,496, the country 's health ministry reported .
With a population of nine million, Israel has reported a total of 455 fatalities from the pandemic.
Israel was one of the first countries to impose a nationwide lockdown and initially was successful in clamping down on the outbreak.
The number of daily cases dropped from the hundreds to the low double digits.

Tony Blair vows never to stop meddling in British politics despite severe Brexit backlash.
Tony Blair has pledged not to stop intervening in UK politics after severe backlash to his involvement in the Labour Party and anti- Brexit campaigning.
Mr Blair, who has been out of office for more than ten years, told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that he will " never " stop speaking out in British politics.
He also acknowledged that he had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a lot of people watching this " and that " a lot of people watching this " had " a

"He is always publishing reports on coronavirus or coming up with arguments on Brexit.
"I wonder if people think that after ten years of being Prime Minister, he is still trying to be involved in politics. "
t it time to take some time out and go around the golf course.
The former prime minister rejected this and vowed to stay around in UK politics as long as he can .
He said, " It is not something that he wants to do.  A lot of people watching would think that it is exactly what he should do and stop talking about things, but he cares about the country. "
" We are at a huge moment of change in the world and the institute he built works around the world. "
"I knows he has done something that previous prime ministers have not done but in the future many more will try to do it. "
Mr Blair said that the UK and EU could still land a deal on Brexit before the end of the year.
He said that the deal would be bad, but that they would be able to land a deal.
It's essentially going to be good for Europe because it will allow easier trade in goods but very inhibiting for them on the issue of services.
The former Labour leader also told Sky News the UK is going to be living with COVID-19, not eliminating it for the foreseeable future .

The Billboard giants push for discounts from airports and councils.

Sources said that the companies were discussing ways to offset the large declines through a rent reduction for the sites they operate or through the removal or reduction of a minimum revenue guarantee, which is typically introduced when a deal is first signed.
One source indicated that the large billboard companies may have guaranteed as much as 85 per cent of their revenue projections in rent.
The contracts between the billboard companies and their landlords have clauses that allow them to reduce the minimum guarantee if the amount of people in an area reduces by a certain percentage, but it is unclear whether this condition is in any of the current contracts between the billboard companies and their landlords.
In addition, the companies are offering large discounts to advertisers to fill available slots on billboards and give them the most value for money possible.
In the inner suburbs of Sydney, the number of ads on a billboard has been reduced from six to four, and in the outer suburbs, the number of ads on a billboard has been reduced from six to four.
40 x 10 metre billboard at Sydney Airport has been upgraded.

JC Decaux declined to comment.
Airports and public transport are lucrative advertising contracts for billboard companies.
According to the 2019 Outdoor Media Association Report, revenue from transport – including airports – was $169.4 million while revenue from street furniture and the outside of buses and trams was 266.5 million.
JC Decaux has contracts with Sydney Airport, Yarra Trams, Perth Airport and Sydney Buses. JC Decaux has billboards in areas such as Qantas lounges, outside Sydney airport, Adelaide Airport and Darwin Airport and inside train stations in Sydney and Melbourne.
Tenders for Melbourne Airport and Sydney Trains have been taking place during the pandemic and an official decision has not been made .
In 2010, the airport was the second largest airport contract in Australia and was worth tens of millions each year.
In 2009, the airport generated $10 million in revenue for the company, in 2010 it was 20 million and in 2011 it was 30 million.
Revenue from the rail contracts and street furniture previously owned by Adshel before it was bought by ooh was $234.8 million.
JC Decaux Australia made $37.7 million in revenue from transport in 2018, according to its 2018 financial results fileed to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.

US " failures " are holding back the search for coronavirus drugs.
The British scientist who is leading the UK ' s programme has warned that the global effort to produce useful anti- Covid medicines is being hampered by the US because researchers are testing drugs in " an arbitrary and willy- nilly way " .
The first of the new drugs has proved to be effective in preventing the spread of the disease and the other two have been found to be useless.
But the failure of the US medical system to match this output has meant that other promising treatments that could have been cleared for widespread use have still to be evaluated.
In particular, convalescent plasma (blood plasma that is taken from Covid-19 patients and which contains antibodies that could protect others against the disease ) has still to be properly tested on a large- scale randomised trial .
100,000 people have been given convalescent plasma in the US but these treatments were not randomised.
1990, he and his colleagues at the University of California at Los Angeles ( UCLA ) began a large- scale experiment to test the effectiveness of plasma in the treatment of AIDs . The experiment involved the use of 10,000 cubes of plasma and 100,000 cubes of plasma in 1990 and 1991 . In 1992 , the experiment involved the use of 100,000 cubes of plasma and 100,000 cubes of plasma . In 1993 , the experiment involved the use of 100,000 cubes of plasma and 100,000 cubes of plasma . In 1994 , the experiment involved the use of 100,000 cubes of plasma and 100,000 cubes of plasma . In 1995 , the experiment involved the use of 100,000 cubes of plasma and 100,000 cubes of plasma . In
The US is failing to do large, randomised trials and that ends up providing bad medicine.
Randomised drug trials are the gold standard for pinpointing useful medicines.
They remove unconscious biases that might cloud clinicians ' judgments.
Thousands of people are given a drug and thousands of others are given a placebo.
No one knows which they have been given.
Then results are compared and the efficacy of the treatment revealed.
In this way, Recovery was able to demonstrate that the steroid dexamethasone reduced deaths by a third in Covid-19 patients on ventilators.
It also showed that the much-hyped drug hydroxychloroquine - as well as the combined therapy of the drugs lopinavir and ritonavir - had no effect in saving patients ' lives.
The trials require large numbers of patients and no single hospital has enough for such research.
Britain has had one key advantage - a centralised National Health Service .
By contrast, the US health service is fragmented and its only success in pointing a possible treatment has been highlighting the usefulness of the highly expensive drug remdesivir for speeding recovery of some Covid-1
" There are lots and lots of small drugs trials involving a few dozen or a few hundred patients going on in the US but nothing of any substance " added Landray.
"They are failing to do large, randomised trials and that ends up providing bad medicine. It makes the practice of medicine poorer and the outcomes for patients poorer "
Landray said this failure was particularly exasperating when it came to the use of convalescent plasma, which many doctors believe could have a key role to play in treating seriously ill Covid-19 patients.
" There is a lot of talk about the use of this treatment in the US and the UK but there is no evidence that it has been used in these countries. "
The other founder of the Recovery programme, Professor Peter Horby, an expert on infectious diseases, said " There have been reports of 20,000 patients getting convalescent plasma in a cohort but none of those patients were randomised .
This was the first time that the effectiveness of convalescent plasma had been tested in a randomised trial.
He added that UK Recovery has now launched a randomised trial of convalescent plasma but does not expect results to be ready until later that year.

Washington - Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats of pushing a coronavirus relief package that focuses on " shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down " as negotiations on the next measure continue.
In an interview with " Face the Nation " on Sunday, Cruz said the country is confronting two crises simultaneously: a global pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 600,000 people worldwide and an " absolute economic catastrophe " in the U.S.
But Cruz said Pelosi, who appeared on " Face the Nation " ahead of the senator, " is " focused on neither of these.
" Her objectives are shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down " the Texas Republican said.
"And in particular, he looks at the $3 trillion bill she is trying to push, it is just shoveling money to her friends and not actually solving the problem.  His objective is to get Americans back to work and to be able to provide for their family.
The White House and Senate Republicans spent last week negotiating the terms of the fourth phase of the coronavirus response, which they expect to cost $1 billion.
Mnuchin told Fox News in an interview Sunday the details are set to be unveiled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mcconnell on Monday .
The most pressing issue for lawmakers - and a point of contention between Republicans and Democrats - is the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits, which began to go away this weekend.
The 600 dollar boost to the benefits was introduced in 2008 to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina and was extended in 2010 to help the victims of the earthquake in Haiti.
He said he is trying to find a way to get the workers back to their jobs.

He also said that Congress should be focusing on passing a recovery bill that would make it easier for Americans to return to work by easing taxes and regulations on small businesses. "instead of just shoveling trillions out the door, a recovery bill would suspend the payroll tax, which would give it a pay raise to everyone in America who 's working
President Trump demanded last week the next aid package include a payroll tax cut, but Mnuchin said it would not be part of the legislation as the proposal was ill received among Republicans.
Mr. Trump acknowledged the payroll tax cut would be absent from the next bill but sought to pin the blame on Democrats.

He also criticized the $3 trillion bill passed by the Democrat- controlled House in May and accused his political opponents of deliberately crafting a measure that damages the president ahead of the November election.
The only objective Democrats have is to defeat Donald Trump and they have cynically decided the best way to defeat Donald Trump is shut down every business in America and shut down every school in America.

Seatttle - After weeks of escalating confrontations between protesters and federal authorities in Portland, Ore , a crowd of about 2,000 people mobilized in Seattle on Saturday , marching through the streets and clashing with the police .
Three police officers were injured, including one who was hospitalized with a leg injury caused by an explosive, and 16 protesters were arrested as of early evening, the police said.

" The Persians " Review . Aeschylus 's Ancient Portrait of Defeat .
There is not much action, barely even a plot in " The Persians " .
People just mill about, talking (admittedly rather intensely ) about events ( admissionly of the tragic kind ) that happened far away.
The National Theatre of Greece production unleashes gale force sound and fury.
At its peak, the show hits like a blow to the solar plexus, taking its breath away - the impact is only slightly dulled by watching it on television.
Aeschylus 's " The Persians " is considered the oldest surviving Greek play, first produced in 472 B.C .
This Dimitris Lignadis staging was broadcast live on Saturday from the ancient amphitheater of Epidaurus, in the spirit of the theater, no recording exists.
The venue was originally conceived as part of the city 's asclepeion ( a healing center ) because the Greeks considered the balance between body and soul essential to good health .
Lets all wistfully ponder that philosophy.
The show deals with the aftermath of Salamis, a naval battle in which the outnumbered Greeks routed the mighty Persian army 2,500 years ago.
At a time when their horizons are closing in, it is downright vertigo-inducing to virtually join a live audience in watching ( subtitled ) live actors all the way in Greece as they perform a millenniums - old play .
Aeschylus himself had fought at Salamis, but his play has a twist. This veteran of the winning side set his story among the defeated, casting a fairly sympathetic eye on his recent enemies.
A chorus of Persian men, wearing long, tan-colored skirts and white button down shirts opens the proceedings.
They are in their capital city anxiously waiting for news of their king, Xerxes, who is off duking it out with Athens.

2006, she directed and starred in an earlier National Theater of Greece production of " The Persians " that played New York City Center in 2006 - and she anchors the proceedings without seemingly doing much at all .
In the second half of the play, she moves to the edge of the stage, becomes a victim of the disaster, then returns to the center of the stage as the scope of the disaster that befell the home troops is revealed.
The messenger ( Argyris Pandagaras ) returns from the front with harrowing details of the apprehension everybody was feeling .
In an absolutely incredible scene, he recounts the battle, whipping himself into a frenzy as the chorus members dance around him and Giorgos Poulios 's drone-like score swells to what must have been a deafening level .

E. Nathena's exquisite costumes always contribute to the storytelling.
The characters lament the lost lives and devastation together, in an act of communal mourning.
This is done in a variety of ways,, but one of the most common is to make it more accessible to the audience.
Often this is done with relatively naturalistic line readings, in an effort to make the text less foreign and easier to digest.
This is the first time that Lignadis and his troupe fully embrace declamation, which may sound a little forced to modern ears but highlights the text's rhythmic power .
The four lead actors are not singers, they do not sing, but they achieve an incantatory power that feels otherworldly.
I never forget that the play is rooted in emotions that are all too human.

He was scheduled to arrive in Islamabad on Sunday, was elected president of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2014.
But in a Twitter post, he said the visit to Pakistan's capital would have to wait.
Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi tweeted in response to Bozkir that " I look forward to welcoming him to Pakistan soon for a constructive and fruitful visit "
A day earlier, a jubilant Qureshi, while announcing the visit, had hoped he would discuss a range of issues with Bozkir, including Kashmir, which is split between Pakistan and neighboring India and claimed by both in its entirety.
Pakistan and India have fought two of their three wars over the disputed region since gaining independence from British rule in 1947.
The two sides often exchange fire in Kashmir, causing troops and civilian casualties on both sides.
Pakistan wants the United Nations to play its role in resolving the issue of Kashmir under its resolutions by allowing people living in the Himalayan region to decide whether they want to merge with India, with Pakistan or whether they prefer independence.

Tight Security Presence outside US Consulate in Chengdu, China
There was a tight security presence outside the U.S. consulate in the city of Chengdu, China Sunday as the American staff prepared to leave the premises.
Three moving trucks were seen entering the building compound, while uniformed and plainclothes police lined both sides of the street, which were lined with metal barriers .
The U.S. consulate in Chengdu was given 72 hours to close, or until 10 a.m. (0200 GMT ) on July 27.
China charged that some personnel at the Chengdu consulate were " conducting activities not in line with their identities "
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said that such activities had interfered in China 's affairs and harmed its security interests.
China's order to close the consulate in Chengdu was issued Friday in retaliation for a U.S. order to close the Chinese consulate in Houston, Texas.
The United States ordered China to close the Houston office " to protect American intellectual property and Americans ' private information " .
As Chinese consulate closure in Houston took effect on Friday, a group of men who appeared to be U.S. officials were seen breaking in to the facility through a back door.
Wang said on Saturday that violated international and bilateral agreements and China would respond, without specifying of how .
The tit for tat closures further escalated the tensions between the two countries over issues from trade and industrial espionage to human rights.

The rock from Mars headed home after 600,000 years on Earth.
A small piece of rock was hurled into space this week on one of the strangest interplanetary voyages ever attempted.
A tiny piece of Martian basalt the size of a 10p coin was launched on board a US robot probe on Thursday and propelled towards the red planet on a seven month journey to its home world.
This extraordinary odyssey, the interplanetary equivalent of sending coals to Newcastle, will form a key part of Nasa 's forthcoming Mars 2020 expedition .
The rock was discovered in 2003 in the Gobi Desert in China and was donated to the Natural History Museum in London in 2005.

Scientists were confident that the rock they were returning to Mars originated on the planet, added Smith, who is also a member of the Mars 2020 science team.
"Tiny bubbles of gas trapped inside that meteorite have exactly the same composition as the atmosphere of Mars, so they know that their rock came from there. "
It is thought that the Martian meteorite was created when an asteroid or comet plunged into the planet about 600,000 to 700,000 years ago, spraying debris into space.
One of those pieces of rubble swept across the solar system and eventually crashed on to Earth.
The meteorite was discovered in Oman in 1999 and has been in the care of the Natural History Museum since then.
The Perseverance rover is equipped with a high precision laser called Sherloc, which will be used to decide the chemical composition of rocks and determine whether they might contain organic materials that indicate life once existed or still exists on Mars.
The inclusion of a piece of SAU 008 is intended to ensure this is done with maximum accuracy.
" The piece of rock they are sending is specifically chosen because it is the right material in terms of chemistry, but also it is a very tough rock " added Smith.
"Some of the Martian meteorites they have are very fragile, this meteorite is as tough as old boots.
Once Perseverance has selected the most promising rocks it can find, it will dump them in caches on the Martian surface.

The famous clear Lake Tahoe has been polluted by climate change.
South Lake Tahoe, California - Despite the pandemic, even on a weekday, people still crowd Pope Beach at Lake Tahoe.
" I like camping and having a bike ride and going swimming at the Lake " said one girl named Dakota.
" It is a place that has a lot of history, a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history and a lot of history
This is because Matt Meunier 's diving business is still going strong, even in a pandemic.
He says he sees " exceptional clarity " and that " Lake Tahoe is the cleanest and most beautiful lake in the country " .
The water is not as clean and clear as it used to be when he moved to Tahoe over two decades ago.
" The thing that they're noticing more and more is down on the rocks " Meunier said.
" The algae on the rocks is strange.
Climate change is believed to have affected the water temperature and thus the clarity.
And 15 million people visit the lake annually - along with the garbage they leave .
Meunier said dive trips to clean up the bottom of the lake found old trash.
en " And when he says old trash, he means the 1960s and 1970s. " Meunier said.
" Beer cans, soda cans and church key cans from the old days "
Scientists monitor the clarity of Lake Tahoe every year by dropping a white disc, then measuring how far down they can see it.
UC Davis professor Geoff Schladow said it " is an important indicator of the health of the lake " .
When it was measured last year, the clarity of the lake was about 80 feet.
That means he can see the disc 80 feet down.
But, consider this, about 20 years ago, the clarity of lake was 100 feet.
This is the trend scientists are trying to reverse.
But they 're fighting the impacts of climate change, development around the lake and something added to the lake in the 1960s : a tiny invasive shrimp brought in to feed the fish .
It didn't work.
" The shrimp came in and there were suddenly no natural cleaners in the lake. "
In the United States, the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River, the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean are among the bodies of water that are affected.
" The lesson here is, if they can't do it at Tahoe, then there is no hope for all the rivers and estuaries, streams and lakes around the country that are never going to have the same degree of attention and the same level of resources. "
He said he is " hopeful " because " if there is a silver lining of the pandemic, he thinks it showed that nature will come back and heal itself when " human pressure " is removed from it and " allow it to happen " .
Salmonella outbreak sickens 212 people in 23 states.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating an outbreak of salmonella that has sickened 212 people in 23 states.
In a Friday press release the CDC reported that 87 people had become ill since its last update on the outbreak Tuesday.
The agency said people began showing symptoms linked to a strain of salmonella, which can take two to four weeks to manifest symptoms between June 19 and July 11.
Thirty-one people have been hospitalized since the outbreak began, but no fatalities have been reported.
According to the CDC, a specific source for the salmonella strain has not been identified.
It has not issued any advisement against eating or consuming particular foods, nor named retailers that might be selling contaminated products.
The United States has the highest number of reported cases of salmonella, with 100,000 reported cases in 2000.
Salmonella is a bacterial, foodborne illness that causes 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations and 420 deaths each year according to the CDC.
The most common symptoms of salmonella infection are diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps, which begin between six hours and six days after exposure.
The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment, but some cases require hospitalization.

Be wary of gardening gimmicks that look too good
It might be an embarrassing thing for a plant scientist to admit, but he is a total sucker for a garden gimmick.
I likes to think it's because he is openminded or maybe just irrationally optimistic, particularly as many things in the plant world are often extremely counterintuitive.
But he is not ashamed to say he has fallen for dozens of them over a lifetime in horticulture.

First up, and probably the worst offender, grafted tomato-potato plants.
In the 1920s and 1930s, scientists in the United States experimented with grafting tomato plants onto the roots of potato plants.
As they are both from the same family and have broadly similar internal " plumbing " they are able to create such surgically enhanced marvels.
The result is that the plant's metabolic energy is divided between the production of fruits and the production of roots. This means that the production of fruits and the production of roots are competing with each other for metabolic energy and therefore the production of fruits and the production of roots are competing with each other for metabolic energy and therefore the production of fruits and the production of roots are competing with each other for metabolic energy and therefore the production of fruits and the production of roots are competing with each other for metabolic energy and therefore the production of fruits and the production of roots are competing with each other for metabolic energy and therefore the production of fruits and the production of roots are competing with each other for metabolic energy and therefore the production of fruits and the production of roots are competing with each other for metabolic energy and therefore the production of fruits and the production of roots are competing with each other for metabolic energy and therefore the production of fruits and the production of roots are competing with each other for metabolic energy and therefore the production of fruits and the production of roots are competing with each other for metabolic
The yields of these grafted plants are terrible and nothing like what they see in the marketing pictures.
This means that the harvesting of the spuds and the ripening of the tomatoes are at different times of the year.
There is a lot of dodgy dealing on the subject of marketing imagery.

Gwyneth Paltrow wants kids to have good 'worth ethic.
Gwyneth Paltrow has said she wants to raise her children to have a good worth ethic as she tries 'not to just hand them things.
Paltrow has two children, Apple ( 16 ) and Moses ( 14 ) with ex-husband Chris Martin and she wants them to have good values and not get by on their parents fame .
" It 's important to raise a kid that has a work ethic and whose values are aligned with hers or with her own sense of who she is. " She told Rob Lowe on his podcast.
"The truth of the matter is the doors can be opened for them, but if they think about all the people who try and it doesn't happen. "
She added, " As a parent, she thinks that all she can do for these kids is to teach them right from wrong and to teach them what work is. She has really tried not to just hand them things.
Paltrow has also taken steps to allow her children to live as privately as possible and ensures they keep their social media accounts private.
" I try to keep them out of the public eye as much as possible "
" It 's different now because kids are like, ' I can have a YouTube channel ' and he 's like, ' I can 't . "

Kargil Diwas is celebrated every year, marking the day the Indian Army recaptured all the Indian posts in Ladakh 's Kargil that had been occupied by Pakistan 's army 21 years ago.
On July 26, 1999, the Army had announced the successful culmination of " Operation Vijay " .
The nearly three- month battle in the icy heights of Ladakh had claimed the lives of more than 500 Indian soldiers.
The National War Memorial was inaugurated in 1948 and is located in the grounds of the National Defence Academy in Hyderabad. It is a memorial to the Indian soldiers who died in World War I, World War II and the Indian War of 1946.
In the decades since Kargil, India - Pakistan relations have been strained following a series of terror strikes.
India has insisted that talks and terror cannot go hand in hand and Pakistan needs to dismantle all the terror camps operating from its soil.
Kenyan police officers arrested after fatal shooting in Garissa
Two police officers in Kenya have been arrested in connection with a shooting in which two people were killed.
The shooting occurred at Soko Ng'ombe market in eastern Garissa county on Saturday during a protest against the arrest of a man suspected of murder.
The two victims have been named as Aden Abdi Madobe and Muhiyadin Adow Shibin.
Kenya's police watchdog has launched an investigation into the shooting.
It will include " forensic analysis " of the officers ' guns.
Aden Duale, MP for Garissa, called the deaths " heinous " and condemned " police brutality " in a statement posted to Facebook.
Campaigners have raised concerns about policing during the pandemic.
According to Amnesty International, Kenyan officers have killed 21 people since March for failing to comply with coronavirus prevention measures such as curfews and masking.

The baboons seen armed with knives, screwdrivers and a chainsaw as " pranksters give them weapons to wreck cars "
The primates at Knowsley safari park, Merseyside are long known to pounce on anyone pausing in the enclosure and ripping off a windscreen wiper or mirror.
The baboons have been armed with knives, screwdrivers and even chainsaws at Knowsley safari park, Merseyside.
Workers fear pranksters are arming the pesky primates, who are known to pounce on anyone who pauses and rip off windscreen wipers and mirrors.
Workers now fear they are being armed with the lethal weapons " for a laugh " by visitors to bolster their attacks and the apes have even been seen rummaging around toolboxes themselves .
One park worker told The Sunday Times " We 're not sure if they are being given weapons by some of the guests who want to see them attack cars, or that they are fished out of pickup trucks and vans. "
" One of the baboons was seen lugging around a chainsaw "

And the baboon attacks are so inevitable that mechanics across the northwest of England have come to know the enclosure well .
One mechanic in Sale, Greater Manchester said people know what to expect at the park and that he has had two customers fall victim to the baboons this year.
They added that one minute kids want monkeys on the car and the next it has no registration plate - but the issue provides " good money " for the garage.
Knowsley reopened on June 15 with Covidd 19 security measures after insisting it was as safe as a McDonalds drive through as visitors do not leave their car on the five mile safari drive.
The 550 acre park, home to lions, tigers, rhinos, wildebeast and camels, dismissed reports of armed apes as an urban myth.
A spokesperson said " They believe many of these stories have grown in exaggeration as they 've been retold, with embellishment to make the objects that are sometimes found in the enclosure seem more exciting and unbelievable.
In 2012 car manufacturer Hyundai let 40 monkeys from the park loose on its New Generation i30 model for 10 hours to prove it had the strength for families with small children.

" In this specific case, the idea is to make available to Angolans a reference hospital, differentiated and equipped with modern technology and high precision in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of high complexity "
It also stresses that the decision of the Angolan Head of State also takes into account the demographic growth of the country, which has motivated a " huge demand " for quality health services in the most diverse specialties.
This demand, the note continues, justifies with the inclusion in the hospital specialized for the treatment of complex diseases, teaching and research, interventions related to ophthalmology and maternal- infant medicine areas whose strategy and management deserve to be under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health.

AP blasts White House press secretary Kayleigh Mcenary for " political " briefings - but reporters keep asking political questions.
The Associated Press has accused White House press secretary Kayleigh Mcenany of worrying the media by making her briefings political rather than informational - apparently forgetting that reporters choose the questions.
An article Saturday by the AP, the largest US news agency, said White House press briefings may be a " broken tradition " as Mcenany has made them " a streamlined, fullthroated advertisement for a president facing reelection, a venue for attacks on the media and a forum relatively light on information " about what the government is doing .
The last of those assertions is indisputable, as hardly any new information is revealed at the briefings.
The AP failed to mention that hardly any new information is actually sought at the briefings.
Reporters frequently use White House pressers to draw attention to themselves, an art form perfected by CNN 's Jim Acosta .
They go beyond the typical adversarial media- administration relationship, repeating each other in asking gotcha questions aimed only at impugning President Donald Trump.
In some cases, they make themselves the news, such as when CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang responded to an " ask China " retort from Trump by making a not so subtle hint at racism " " Sir,, why are he saying that to her specifically " .
A July 6 briefing offered a prime example of the disconnect over how the briefings have ceased to be a source of meaningful information for Americans.
He also said that he would not be able to attend the 2007 NFL All-- Star Game due to his commitment to the 2007 NBA All- Star Game .
Mcenany said that she did not believe that the Confederate flag was a symbol of racism and that she did not believe that the Confederate flag was a symbol of racism. She said that she did not believe that the Confederate flag was a symbol of racism and that she did not believe that the Confederate flag was a symbol of racism.

The AP said she sounded " exasperated " during the briefing.
The AP's story echoed a Washington Post oped column earlier this month by ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl, who also is president of the White House Correspondents Association.
The White House podium is used for purely political purposes, denying reality is a violation of public trust.
She has also been criticized by some for her aggressive style and for not being a good diplomatic ambassador for the United States.
The pressers had been absent for more than a year before her appointment.

The number of countries imposing travel restrictions is growing.
As of this week, the Czech Republic wants to conduct coronavirus tests for Bulgarian seasonal workers.
Bulgarians are allowed to stay in Denmark only if they have an address registration there, an employment contract or a document certifying a business trip.
As of today, people who have visited Bulgaria and Romania in the last 14 days are subject to mandatory quarantine in Italy.
In Finland, entry is only for a " valid reason " .
Mandatory home quarantine in Austria, despite a negative PCR test.
This is already required for those entering Germany.
For the next 14 days, access to southern Romania was denied without good reason.
And Greece has tightened measures even more along its land borders .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that from Tuesday, those traveling by plane from Bulgaria to Greece would have to present to the Greek border authorities a negative result from a PCR test for coronavirus performed up to 72 hours before their entry into their southern neighbor.
They added that only passengers who have a certificate for such a test would be allowed in the country.
It must be issued in English and contain the three names and numbers of the passenger's passport or identity card.
The authorities in their southern neighbor will not accept certificates that do not meet these requirements.
"Travelers are tested in the laboratory by RT-PCR by taking secretions from the mouth or nose. "
Tests for coronavirus are recognized if they are performed in national reference laboratories, national health laboratories or private laboratories that are accredited by the relevant national accreditation bodies ( not necessarily specifically for coronavirus ) .
The measure does not apply to Greek citizens, citizens residing in Greece and travelers for significant professional reasons.
The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs also announced that on Tuesday, July 28 and Wednesday of July 29, passengers who did not have time to be tested before their trip were tested by the competent Greek authorities upon arrival in Greece.
The requirement for citizens traveling by plane to Greece to fill in at least 24 hours in advance an electronic Passenger Location Form ( PLF ) generating a QR code, which they present to the Greek authorities upon entering the country remains in force.
More information is published on travel.gov.gr.
At the moment there is no change in the requirements for crossing the land borders between Bulgaria and Romania.
" Travelers to Greece across the land border, regardless of their citizenship, must also fill in an electronic passenger localization form ( PLF ) generating a QR code at least 24 hours before arrival. "
The closure of the Ilinden, Kapitan Petko Voyvoda and Makaza checkpoints has increased traffic across the border near Petrich.
There are no problems with the transition.
There are no queues of trucks.
All those waiting go to sea in Greece.
Travelers wait about an hour and a half to cross the Tower.
Three of the points on the Bulgarian- Romanian border are working.
Only " Ilindin - Exohi " and the part of Ivaylovgrad are closed.
UN says thousands of anti- Pakistan militants in Afghanistan
The U.N. report also says that the Pakistani Taliban group is responsible for killing more than 100 Pakistani military and civilian targets in Afghanistan.

Some of TTP's members have even joined the IS affiliate, which has its headquarters in eastern Afghanistan .
The Afghan government did not respond Sunday to requests by The Associated Press for comment.
The report said that IS in Afghanistan has been hit hard by Afghan security forces as well as U.S. and NATO forces and even on occasion by the Afghan Taliban.
The report was prepared by the U.N. analytical and sanctions monitoring team, which tracks terrorist groups around the world.
The report estimated the membership of IS in Afghanistan at 2,200, and while its leadership has been depleted, IS still counts among its leaders a Syrian national Abu Said Mohammad al Khorasani.
The report also said the monitoring team had received information that two senior Islamic State commanders, Abu Qutaibah and Abu Hajar al- Iraqi had recently arrived in Afghanistan from the Middle East.
"The Islamic State is still capable of carrying out high-profile attacks in various parts of the country, including Kabul.
It also aims to attract Taliban fighters who oppose the agreement with the United States " the report said, referring to a US peace agreement signed with the Taliban in February.
The deal was struck to allow the U.S. to end its 19 year involvement in Afghanistan and calls on the Taliban to guarantee its territory would not be used by terrorist groups.
The deal is also expected to guarantee the Taliban 's all out participation in the fight against IS .
The second and perhaps most critical part of the agreement calls for talks between the Taliban and Kabul 's political leadership .
The U.S. State Department issued a statement saying its peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was again shuttling through the region seeking to jump start those negotiations, which have been repeatedly postponed as both sides squabble over a prisoner release program.
The U.S - backed deal calls for the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners and the Taliban to release 1,000 government and military personnel as a so - called good will gesture ahead of talks .
The Taliban has refused to release the 600 prisoners it calls high- profile criminals and has offered to release alternatives.
The Taliban have refused.
"The parties are closer than ever to the start of intra-- Afghan negotiations, the key next step to ending Afghanistan 's 40 year long war " said the U.S. State Department statement.
"Albeit significant progress has been made on prisoner exchanges, the issue requires additional effort to fully resolve.
The Taliban 's political spokesman earlier this week said it was ready to hold talks with Kabul 's political leaders after the Islamic holiday of Eid al- Adha at the end of the month, providing the prisoner release is completed .
A big worry for Pakistan is the presence in Afghanistan of militants, particularly linked to the TTP or Jamaatul Ahrar or Lashkar e Islam, as well as those with the Baluchistan Liberation Army, which has taken responsibility for high- profile attacks in the southern Sindh province as well as in southwestern Baluchistan Province.
The Pakistani army has been fighting with insurgents in the southwestern province of Baluchistan since 2009.
The TTP took responsibility for one of the most horrific attacks in Pakistan in 2014, when a Pakistani army school was attacked and 140 were killed.
Most were students, and some were as young as 5.
" The total number of Pakistani foreign terrorist fighters in Afghanistan posing a threat to both countries is estimated at between 6,000 and 6,500, most of them with TTP. "

There ' s mask shaming and then there ' s full on assault .
A California couple having lunch with their puppy at a dog park experienced the second, when an irate woman pepper-sprayed them for refusing to mask up.
O 'Brien and Kelley say they were grabbing a bite to eat at Dusty Rhodes dog park in San Diego on Thursday, with their three- month old pug in tow.
The pair had their masks off to eat, when a " random old lady " approached, calling them "idiots " for not masking up, even though " they can't wear a mask and eat at the same time " .
O'Brien told the woman to leave the park and stop harassing her, at which point the woman unleashed a can of mace at the couple .
Kelley then grabbed the spray can from the woman and received a dose of mace in his face.
O'Brien can be heard crying in the background as the attacker walks away with her dogs.
O'Brien shared the video on Facebook and told ABC 10 that she wants to see the woman " go to jail " .
In the state of California, face masks are mandatory, even in fresh air.
These masks can only be removed at a select few times, including when eating or drinking.
The state's guidelines do not specify that bystanders may use non- lethal weapons to enforce this policy.
In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the use of masks as a form of civil disobedience. The Supreme Court also upheld the use of masks as a form of civil disobedience in 2000.

Manchester United star Paul Pogba has suggested he will stay at the club this summer after the Red Devils sealed a place in the top four.
A 2-0 win against Leicester meant United finished in third, ahead of Frank Lampard 's Chelsea .
United were 14 points off Leicester just 12 matches ago but a sensational run of form saw the Red Devils finish in the top four .
Pogba had been expected to leave the club this summer after twice requesting to leave in the last two years.
However, the pandemic means few clubs will be spending big this summer and there is not a buyer available that could combine a transfer fee and Pogba 's salary to entice him away from Old Trafford.
Pogba's performances and body language have improved in recent weeks.
And the Frenchman has dropped the latest hint that he 's set to stay at the club by posting on his Instagram after his side 's 2 - 0 win .
The club 's return to the competition in 2010 was the first time since 2006 that the club competed in the UEFA Champions League .
Pogba has a year to run on his existing deal, though the club can extend that by 12 months meaning he effectively has two years to run.
United are keen on extending Pogba 's deal and they want clarity over his situation before next season.
Pogba, for his part, feels comfortable at the club and has been buoyed by the arrival of Bruno Fernandes .
Pogba has been a revelation at Old Trafford and his arrival has allowed Pogba to play in a deeper central midfield position, which has also improved his mood.
The 2008- 2009 financial year was the most successful in the history of the SME scheme, with a total of 100,000 grants being awarded. In the 2009 – 2010 financial year, 100,000 grants were awarded to 100,000 recipients. In the 2010 – 2011 financial year, 100,000 grants were awarded to 100,000 recipients . In the 2011 – 2012 financial year, 100,000 grants were awarded to 100,000 recipients . In the 2012 – 2013 financial year, 100,000 grants were awarded to 100,000 recipients .

The small business sector,, often under-served by the big banks , has increasingly turned to online lenders to meet its funding needs .
However, Mr Callaghan said that online lenders were disadvantaged compared to the big banks because they did not have access to the same lower priced funding and warned as a result the SME guarantee scheme was not gaining traction .
"I think it has probably missed the mark where all the people who call them call in the expectation they can get very cheap funding rather than the government backing 50 per cent of the loan.
" So they call and they get very disappointed because the expectation has been put out there that there is discount pricing and they look at their cost of funding which has not changed at all. "
Mr Callaghan added if fintechs were able to access cheaper funding and pass that on to small businesses the scheme would be a " no brainer "

"I can understand there might be others who are not passing through that cost structure " he said.
" It is a function of how their funding is structured and it is a function also of which categories they are lending into and how they assess risk within those categories. "
Mr Allegos would not provide details of the number of loans Moula had issued under the scheme but said the revamped scheme was " a core recognition of what needed to change " to offer more flexibility to lenders and borrowers .
He said that he was concerned about the " two speed economy " that was operating and the impact this would have on small businesses .
en " The biggest issue Moula has to face and lenders with respect to small businesses is that proverbial cliff and how to manage into that cliff " he said.
"Generally speaking with respect to demand, they have not returned to pre-- Cocida levels, although appetite is growing.
The government 's decision to extend the scheme was welcomed by Prospa ' s chief executive, Greg Moshal .
" We support any enhancements to the scheme that will enable small businesses to access a wide range of funding products that meet their requirements, including flexible cash flow products over shorter terms "
200 years old. The Union Chain Bridge is 200 years old.
A bridge linking Scotland and England has turned 200 years old ahead of a £10 million renovation.
The Union Chain Bridge crosses the River Tweed from Fishwick in the Scottish Borders to Horncliffe in Northumberland.
When it opened in 1820, it was the longest wrought iron suspension bridge in the world with a span of 449 feet (137 m .
It was also the first vehicular bridge of its type in the UK.
The bridge was designed by English Royal Navy officer Capt. Samuel Brown.
He patented and produced wrought iron chains after being affected by the loss of Royal Naval ships which had broken free from ropes.
The Union Chain Bridge was built in 1806 to connect the Isle of Man to the island of Ireland. It was the first bridge to connect the two islands.

"We had planned a number of celebrations to mark the occasion, but unfortunately they have had to be postponed.
"However, the fact that work is shortly going to begin on the £10m renovation is the best birthday present possible and will ensure generations to come will be able to enjoy the bridge in all its splendour "
The bridge was built in 1894 and was used for 100 years before it was demolished in 1994.
She said, " It is renowned the world over and it is fantastic that work will shortly commence on its renovation.

If West is still serious about running for the presidency, write-in votes may be his only path to victory or indeed any kind of showing.
The rapper announced his candidacy on July 4, past the deadline to file as a candidate in at least six states.

Kanye West claims he has tried to divorce Kim Kardashian, accuses her and mother-in-law " Kris Jong Un " of White Supremacy.
The rally was described across news sites and gossip mags as a publicity stunt, evidence of mental illness or both.

It is also unlikely that he could surpass Joe Biden's reputed 48 percent, he could in theory siphon enough votes from Biden to see President Donald Trump clinch a second term - something pundits on both sides suspect may be his plan .

The Congress is planning a countrywide protest on Monday over the situation in Rajasthan, where the Ashok Gehlot government is struggling to survive.
The party said that the protest would be held outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of President Ram Nath Kovind.
In the video, the Congress has accused the BJP of " Ripping up the constitution and demolishing democracy " while the whole country is fighting the coronavirus .
It has done the same in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress said.
The party said in the video that it is " demanding to immediately convene an assembly session which is within their constitutional rights " .
He has turned down a proposal to start an assembly session in the state of Rajashtan.
A second one was submitted today which he said he is examining .
Mr Gehlot's government has been in deep crisis after his deputy Sachin Pilot turned rebel with a chunk of MLAs supporting him.
The party has been unable to disqualify the rebels to bring down the majority mark in the assembly.
Mr. Pilot's removal from the party and the government was the result of a dispute between the government and the party over the powers of the Speaker. The High Court of Rajashtan ruled that the Speaker could not take any action until the larger constitutional dispute about the powers of the Speaker was resolved.
The Supreme Court will decide whether a court can intervene in the Speaker's decisions.
The Congress stands only one past the majority mark in the 200 member assembly.

The BJP has 72 and including allies and Independents it stands at 97.
The Congress can lose the second of the three governments it formed in the heartland states after the 2018 assembly elections when the court decides in favour of Mr Pilot.
In March, it lost the Kamal Nath led government in Madhya Pradesh after Jyotiraditya Scindia joined the BJP with 22 of his MLAs.

In 2010, the White House deployed 100 federal agents to Chicago to help combat rising rates of some crimes, a move that marked an expansion of the White House 's intervention into local law enforcement as Trump continued to position himself as the " law and order " president .
The " surge " of agents announced on Wednesday to Chicago and other American cities is part of Operation Legend , named after 4 year old Legend Taliferro , who was fatally shot while sleeping in a Kansas City apartment late last month .
The deployment of federal agents to aid local law enforcement is not unprecedented - Attorney General Bill Barr announced a similar surge effort in December for seven cities that had seen spiking violence - the type of federal agent being sent and some of their tactics have raised concerns among state and local lawmakers .
A number of lawmakers from New York to Portland have spoken out against the Trump administration sending the agents to their cities, especially following reports that unidentified federal agents detained protesters in Portland and took them away in unmarked vehicles.

The surges have only exacerbated tensions, and criminal justice experts say the efforts defy explanation because of the unprecedented moment America is living through - with a pandemic, historic unemployment and a mass reckoning over racism and how people of color are treated by police.
The Egyptian court referred the man who murdered three children to psychiatric evaluation.
The South Minya Prosecution's Attorney General Tamer Motea on Sunday sentenced a farmer to four days imprisonment pending investigations into why he murdered his three children while also referring him to a psychiatric committee .
On July 24, 56-year old Mohamed Ali threw his children Khadiga, four, Mena eight and Omar six in front of a moving train at the Mallawi Railway Station.
Ali was found to be babbling incoherently during investigations, leading to suspicion he was suffering a mental breakdown.
His wife denied she had suffered any problems with him and attributed his behavior to psychological issues.
The villagers from Massart Mallawi refused to speak about the incident, only offering their condolences to the children's family.
Roughly 93 percent of Egyptian children aged one to 14 years old suffer from violence, said Khalid Darwish, advisor to the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood back in October.
Prosecution is one of the most important pillars in eliminating child abuse, he added, stressing the importance of cooperation between the council and Public Prosecution in this regard.
According to a study prepared by the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood, children are subjected to violence in places that are supposed to be safe, such as home, school or clubs and exposed to violence from people who are supposed to care for them, such as parents or teachers.

Dominic Raab says that the Government can't make apologies for the Spain quarantine decision.
Dominic Raab has defended the Government's decision to reintroduce quarantine measures on Spain at short notice.
Ministers announced on Saturday that holidaymakers who had not returned from Spain and its islands by midnight would be forced to self-isolate for 14 days.
The country had been on a list of " travel corridor " nations deemed safe to visit by Downing Street, but a recent surge in coronavirus cases has sparked fears of a second wave of the disease.
On Sunday, the Foreign Secretary defended the sudden reimposition of restrictions as a " real time response " to a worrying spike in infections reported in the region.
He said the situation was then assessed yesterday afternoon " and they took the decision as swiftly as they could.
" We can't make apologies for doing so " he added.
" We must be able to take swift, decisive action, particularly in relation to localised, or internationally in relation to Spain or a particular country where they see they must take action.
"Otherwise, they risk re-infection into the UK, potentially a second wave there and then another lockdown. "
in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 , 2024 , 2025 , 2026 , 2027 , 2028 , 2029 , 2030 , 2031 , 2032 , 2033 , 2034 , 2035 , 2036 , 2037 , 2038 , 2039 , 2040 , 2041 , 2042 , 2043 , 2044 , 2045 , 2046 , 2047 , 2048 , 2049 , 2050 , 20
The decision was made after Spain recorded more than 900 new daily cases of the disease for two consecutive days.
The Foreign Secretary acknowledged that many tourists had been left with no time to cancel or alter their plans.
"I understand it is disruptive for those going through this who are in Spain or have been considering going but they must be able to take swift and decisive action to protect the UK.
"We 've made such progress in getting the virus down and preventing the virus re--taking hold in the UK.
Passengers arrive at Gatwick Airport on Sunday morning following Saturday's announcement ( PA )
Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth condemned the Government for its "frankly shambolic " handling of the measure.
He said Downing Street's sudden decision had left holidaymakers " confused and distressed "
The Labour MP told Sophy Ridge : "He understands the decision but the way in which the decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic .
" There are holidaymakers in Spain at the moment confused and distressed, there are people about to go on holiday to Spain and the islands like Tenerife who are confused and they don't know whether their employers will allow them to take two weeks ' quarantine.
" The Government is just saying that employers will cooperate. "
"The way in which this decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic.
100,000 holidaymakers in Spain are on the quarantine list. 100,000 holidaymakers in Spain are on the quarantine list. 100,000 holidaymakers in Spain are on the quarantine list. 100,000 holidaymakers in Spain are on the quarantine list 100,000 holidaymakers in Spain are on the quarantine list 100,000 holidaymakers in Spain are on the quarantine list 100,000 holidaymakers in Spain are on the quarantine list 100,000 holidaymakers in Spain are on the quarantine list 100,000 holidaymakers in Spain are on the quarantine list 100,000 holidaymakers in Spain are on the quarantine list 100,000 holidaymakers in Spain are on the quarantine list 100,000 holidaymakers in Spain are on the quarantine list 100,000 holidaymakers in
He urged ministers to offer " clarity " on whether those who are asked to quarantine will receive financial support if their employers refuse to pay them during the quarantine period.
He added that clear information was also needed " for those holidaymakers who are currently in Spain who have properly saved up all year for their family holiday who are confused and distressed "
" The way in which this decision has been communicated is obviously causing anxiety " he stressed.
Mr Raab said no worker following the new guidance should be penalised by employers, including by being put onto sick pay.
He said that the law is changed in relation to holidaymakers and travelers, and that employers are expected to show the flexibility they need to the employees who have to quarantine because of the law.
"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self- isolating the way they should, they can't have penalties taken against them.
Car drives through crowd and a protester is shot in Colorado.
A car drove through a crowd and a protester was shot in the suburban Denver suburb of Aurora during demonstrations against racial injustice.
The police department said that the protesters were walking on Interstate 225 on Saturday when a vehicle drove through.
Police said a protester fired a weapon, striking at least one person who was taken to a hospital in stable condition.
The authorities said the vehicle was towed and they are investigating.
Protesters also broke windows to the courthouse and a fire was started in an office, police said .
An unlawful assembly was declared and police ordered protesters to leave the area.
Tensions have been heightened at recent protests against racial injustice since federal officials were sent to quell demonstrations in Portland, Oregon.
Police declared a riot in Seattle on Saturday.
Protests sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man in Minnesota who died after a white officer held him to the ground with a knee to his neck have also highlighted other cases of fatal police violence.
In Colorado, protesters have been drawing attention to the death of Elijah McClain, who was stopped by police while walking down an Aurora street in August 2019 after a 911 caller reported him as suspicious.
Police placed him in a chokehold and paramedics administered 500 milligrams of ketamine, a sedative, to calm him down.
He went into cardiac arrest, was later declared brain dead and taken off life support.

UFC fighter Correia gets pummelled after turning back on rival mistakenly thinking round is over ( RT Sport News )
Bantamweight Bethe Correia is a UFC veteran but made an amateur error by turning her back on opponent Pannie Kianzad and mistakenly thinking the round was over in their bout on Fight Island and was taged as a result.
The 37- year old Correia appeared to mistake the 10 second warning for the actual end of the round, reaching out a glove before turning her back on Kianzad and making her way back to her corner.
The Swedish fighter capitalized without hesitation, taging her opponent with a right hand before following up with a series of blows to back Correia against the cage .
Momentarily appearing in danger, the Brazilian then regained control to stifle the threat and back Kianzad up before the actual end of the round was called .
" This is the first time in the history of Indian cricket that a batsman has scored 100 runs in 100 balls . "
It was just one part of a frustrating night for former bantamweight title challenger Correia, who went down to a unanimous decision defeat which is her third loss in her past four octagon outings and leaves her overall record at 11 - 5 with one draw.
The 28- year old Kianzad, born in Iran, won her second victory in a row following her victory over Jessica-Rose Clark at UFC Fight Night in Moscow back in November.
Kianzad is now 13 - 5 overall and 2 – 1 in the UFC as the woman known as " Banzai " aims to shift up the 135 lbs rankings.

Leicester happy to hit target of European football says Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy.
He said he was disappointed at missing out on Champions League football, but said that Leicester had achieved their early season objective of qualifying for Europe.
The Foxes were second in December and third when football restarted after lockdown, but they took just four points from their last five games to finish fifth in the Premier League.
A final day win over Manchester United would have secured a top four finish, but Brendan Rodgers ' side suffered a 2-0 loss, which Vardy says was the most upsetting aspect.
It was disappointing, more the way they ended up losing the game, he said on Sky Sports at fulltime.
" But they 've said in the dressing room, they targeted behind closed doors to qualify for Europe and they 've done that. "
"We had the chance to qualify for the Champions League and that was even better, but they would reflect on it and come back stronger the next year. "
" It is hard to take, but their main target was Europe and they managed to do that. "
In 2010, he was named the Premier League 's Player of the Year and the Football Association 's Player of the Year .
He paid tribute to his teammates in receiving the award and said there are still plenty of miles left in him at the top level, despite his advancing age.
" I 'm delighted, it 's all about the team and it 's all about the team 's goals. It 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals and it 's all about the team 's goals
I 'll have a rest for a bit now and come back for next season ready to go. Fortunately he doesn 't feel his age, his legs are still fine and touch wood he doesn 't pick up many injuries, so it 's about keeping on top of that and come back as strong as he can next year.
Top British bank HSBC denies " setting up trap " for China's Huawei in US investigations.
HSBC said it was not involved in the " fabrication of evidence " against Huawei, which led to the arrest of the company's chief financial officer in Canada.
In a now- unavailable post on Wechat, the lender said that its actions did not trigger US investigations into the world 's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment, as the scrutiny of Huawei for allegedly violating US sanctions on Iran began well before the bank 's involvement in late 2016 .
HSBC did not have any hostility towards Huawei and did not " frame " Huawei, the bank said on Saturday, adding that it would never distort any facts about its clients.
" In response to the US Department of Justice's requests for information, the HSBC Group simply presented the objective facts.
HSBC did not " fabricate " evidence or " hide " facts.
1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 2010s and 201
The post has been blocked on the platform with a note that it " violates regulations " and is not available now.
HSBC has been accused of " conspiring " with Washington to set a trap for Huawei. The statement comes shortly after multiple Chinese media outlets, including state- linked newspapers, accused HSBC of " conspiring " with Washington to set a trap for Huawei.
The company has been at the epicenter of a diplomatic scandal for more than a year and a half since Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in December 2018 in Canada on a warrant from the US.
Meng faces fraud charges for allegedly using a shell company to violate sanctions against Iran and allegedly lying to banks about the link between Huawei and Iranian company Skycom.
According to the Global Times, HSBC was well aware of the Chinese company's relationship with Skycom.
The bank reportedly opted to " collude " with the US government to escape more severe punishment in 2012, when the bank had to admit to money laundering and sanctions violations, including restrictions on Iran.
It was ordered at the time to pay around $1.9 million in penalties and to prevent any similar misconduct.
"The evidence indicated that HSBC understood this relationship but intentionally sold out its customer 's confidential business documents to the US side so that the US government could overlook the British bank 's own misconduct and not punish it under the 2012 Deferred Prosecution Agreement.
In a veiled warning, the Beijing- controlled newspaper added that the lender, if proven to be guilty of this " collusion " could face " harsh punishment " in China, one of the major markets for HSBC.
In 2006, the bank was involved in a controversy over the publication of a photo of a young woman in a bathing suit on the cover of a magazine.
In 2009, HSBC became the first company in Hong Kong to be awarded the title of " the best company in the world " by the British newspaper The Times.
The bank faced criticism from both sides - from the West with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling the endorsement a " corporate kowtow " and the East with the Chinese side reportedly saying that its support was " belated ".
Firefighers gain ground on Lassen County fires.
Firefighters are gaining ground against two wildfires that have burned more than 30,000 acres in Lassen County, northeast of Sacramento.
The Gold fire, which started south of Adin, is 40 % contained as it continues to threaten homes and ranches as well as agriculture, livestock and timber operations, Cal Fire officials said in an update Saturday morning.
After burning for four days, the fire has chewed through 21,000 acres, destroyed seven homes and sent two firefighters to the hospital.
Overnight, firefighters took advantage of milder conditions to build and reinforce control lines.
But gusty winds and low humidity are expected through Saturday.
East of Susanville, a smaller fire known as the Hog fire has destroyed two structures and consumed about 10,000 acres.
The fire settled down overnight as firefighters worked to mop up and strengthen control lines, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .
By Saturday morning, it was 45 % contained and had been burning for six days.
In the daytime heat, with temperatures above 90 degrees in the Susanville area, smoldering patches were at risk of flaring up.
While some residents are being allowed to return to their homes, some areas in both fire zones remain under mandatory evacuation orders.
The two firefighters injured in the Gold fire have been released from the hospital.
Algeria loses a patriot and committed militant, says President Tebboune.
Algiers - President of the Republic, Abdelmadjid Tebboune sent a message of condolence to members of the People's National Assembly ( APN ) Mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, who died on Friday, in which he said that Algeria " has lost a patriot and a militant committed to the causes of his people and his nation " .
Algeria loses today, by the death of Mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, a patriot and a militant committed to the causes of his people and his nation, a man who has never wavered and whose determination remained intact from the moment he took up arms alongside his valiant Mujahedeen brothers until his last breath on this sad day when they can only resign themselves to God's will. President Tebboune wrote in his message of condolence.
" The late Mahmoud Guemama, peace be upon him, belonged to a unique generation of faithful patriotic militants who sacrificed themselves for their homeland " added President of the Republic.
"The deceased devoted his life to the liberation of Algeria from the torments of abject colonialism, by joining the ranks of the Revolution in the prime of life in 1960 in the Tahart training camp of the historic wilaya VI.
"The late President is known to all for his proven militancy and his commitment to anchoring the image of a prosperous and united Algeria.
In the far south, the late Mahmoud Guemama enjoys great renown as a mediator, intervening to reconcile brothers in the same country whenever the fire of discord is kindled.
" All these qualities and values earned the late Mahmoud Guemama the respect and trust of the people of Tamanrasset who chose him to represent them in the People's National Assembly ( APN ) for several terms, during which he was the ambassador and defender of the concerns of the region and the aspirations of its people, and even the representative and spokesman of all Algerians " wrote the President of the Republic.
" All expressions of condolence will not be enough to pay tribute to the mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, peace be upon him.
He is leaving us at a time when Algeria needs him " said the President.
"He prays to Almighty God to surround the deceased with his holy mercy and to welcome him in his vast paradise alongside the shuhadaa and virtuous.
I also pray to God to lend his family and loved ones patience and comfort . There is no strength or power except in God . The President of the Republic concluded .

Virginia Beach takes down Confederate monument
The 115 year old Confederate monument was removed from public grounds on Saturday, less than two days after the City Council voted unanimously to do so.
Workers took down the 27 foot (8.2 meter ) tall monument on Saturday morning, media outlets reported.
It was removed in 2007 and is now on display at the South Carolina Museum of African American History and Culture in Charleston, South Carolina.
The council voted unanimously Thursday night to begin the removal process.
The council had listened to dozens of speakers and decided the monument is viewed by many as divisive and a painful reminder of the past.
The statue recently had been completely covered, with a locked gate around it following recent protests and vandalism at other Confederate monuments.
The monument will be stored for now.
The city now must wait for any offers from historical groups or other entities that might want to take the monument.
The interior minister of Tunisia named a new prime minister to form a government in a month.
Tunisia 's Interior Minister Hichem Mechichi has been appointed to form the next government, the president 's office said, amid political tensions among major parties in the North African country .
The 46- year old lawyer succeeds Elyes Fakhfakh, who resigned as prime minister earlier this month.
But Mechichi was not one of the names proposed by the governing political parties to President Kais Saied.
In a statement following Saturday's announcement, Mechichi said he would " work to form a government that meets the expectations of all Tunisians "
Tunisia has been praised as a rare success story for democratic transition after the Arab Spring regional uprisings sparked by its 2011 revolution.
But its leaders have struggled to meet the expectations of the Tunisian people and the already fragile economy has been battered by the closure of the country's borders because of the COVID-19 pandemic .
The disease has killed nearly 50 people and infected more than 1,400 in Tunisia.
As well as being the interior minister in the outgoing government, Mechichi has been a counsellor to President Saied, handling legal matters.
He has previously been chief of staff at the Ministry of Transport and also served in the Ministry of Social Affairs.
He now has a month to form a government, which will then face a parliamentary vote of confidence and will need an absolute majority to succeed.
Failing that, parliament would be dissolved and new elections would be held within three months.
In the last elections held in October, the Ennahdha party came on top but fell far short of a majority and eventually agreed to join a coalition government.
Fakhfakh's resignation on July 15, after less than five months in office, threatened fresh political deadlock in the nation as it struggles with the economic fallout of the pandemic.
The resignation deepened the political dispute with Ennahdha over allegations against Fakhfakh of conflicts of interest.
The 47-year old outgoing leader's relations with Ennahdha have been strained since the October legislative elections.
Fakhfakh stepped down the same day the party filed a no- confidence motion against him.
