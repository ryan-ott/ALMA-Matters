The fourth vaccination is scheduled to take place in the summer or autumn of 2022.

Despite an active campaign in Germany, two or three doses of vaccines from the coronavirus are unlikely to be sufficient for full protection.
In this unanimous leader of the Association of Overseas Medical Corps, Ulrich Wigegeldt.

The results of the pre-liminary research conducted in Australia.
In the spring of 2022, the producers of BioNTech and Pfizer planned to release a vaccine adapted to the Omicron.
The two doses of the vaccine do not provide adequate protection against the new variant of the coronavirus " Omicron " .
In the case of two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness decreased by more than 25 times.
" This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide adequate protection from infection with the bacterium.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
The experts are in favor of accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the president of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Sasalczberger advocates the reduction of the interval between the second and third inoculation.
In addition, according to Saslchberger, the accelerated spread of the delta virus and the amicron variant of the coronavirus have an influence on the spread.
