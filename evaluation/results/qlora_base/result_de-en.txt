The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the customs value...
I am a #PRS_ORG# big customer, so it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or reference to put on the package so it can be tracked back to you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today, it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find it very annoying.
Do I need to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way of getting a refund?
I fundamentally don't think it's fair to ask children to take on the role of parent for their younger siblings.
However, I think it's good for big siblings to pitch in and help out with the little ones.
Take a look, help for a short time, bring the bottle etc.
They learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
It's good if your K1 is OK with being alone for a short time, even if it's just for a short while.
You know your children best, so you will be able to judge whether this is something they will enjoy.
It's not as if he has to wrap K2 in cotton wool and sit with him for hours while he falls asleep.
It is probably dubious, at best, from a legal standpoint.
Maybe that is why the psychologist's statement is so strong.
Because if something actually does happen, like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be far too much responsibility for K1 to have to worry about K2 as well.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago, and I can remember almost all of the plot, but the title just won't come to me - maybe someone can help?
The story was about fear and how to deal with it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by stuffing himself with food and going into his enclosure with his aggressive cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner, who gets in touch with his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats patients with fears.
The commissioner has a young niece who also has a fear (of fire), and she ends up at this therapist's office.
There are more suicides, and there is another protagonist - a photographer, who is anonymously commissioned to go to the place of suicide and to document and upload the photos onto the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs an underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the patient's brain that suppresses a fear center and forces the patient to face their fears to the extreme.
(a woman jumps to her death, another is driven to suicide on purpose)
This act of facing one's fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital with the fireman.
That's the gist of it. I'm pretty sure the book was written by a French author.
If anyone knows who did this, or even knows the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the WiFi.
I have to contact my husband first.
That may take time though.
What's the next step?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 y.o., splinter under the thumb nail
A four-year-old child has wood splinters under all his fingernails (outer side).
They tried to pull him out with a pinzeta.
Quite tricky.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try to do this.
No chance.
I have an appointment with the doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining a digital decoder with a sound module on a single PCB, we can achieve a footprint of just 30mm x 15.5mm, which means it can be installed in almost any H0 or 0-scale locomotive.
The LokSound 5 decoder is offered with all common interfaces, and always comes with an 11x15mm "candy cube" loudspeaker with a sound capsule assembly.
As with all family members, LokSound 5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It supports the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register with an appropriate digital centre.
It is capable of all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom® it is possible to read CV values on the main track.
There are lookup tables for central processors that can only program CVs from 1 to 255.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speeds at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola addresses enable the release of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the venerable 6021 Control Unit.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic login to mfx®-compatible central stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognises Märklin® braking tracks as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC wheel bearings or with regenerative braking.
In addition, it is held in place by a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC (Automatic Baby Changer) swing allows automatic back-and-forth motion between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC tracks.

Omicron: Johnson wants to push ahead with a booster vaccination
Politicians and scientists in the UK are dealing with an ever-increasing number of Omicron cases.
So, all adults in England who are eligible will be offered a vaccine until the end of December.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make faster progress with the Covid-19 booster vaccinations given the rapid rise in Omikron cases.
Every adult in England will have had the chance to get a booster dose by the end of the year, Mr Johnson said in a pre-recorded video to the nation on Sunday, adding that those eligible should have received their second dose at least three months ago.
Up until now, the goal date has been set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
We are faced with an emergency in terms of the Omikron variant, which is why it is so important to reinforce the vaccination programme, Johnson said.
The good news is that the protection level can be raised again with a third dose.
"Get vaccinated now!" Johnson said.
Another 1,239 Omicron cases were reported in the UK on Sunday, bringing the total to 3,137.
This was an increase of 65 per cent over the previous day. dpa
Will I get a full refund if I collect in person?
I stand up for the inclusion of all genders
I applied.

I'll get back to you on that e-mail.
However, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled it and it depends on where they come from, whether it's a man or a woman.
**I have no clue how to write this email.
Can someone help?

Conclusion: Everyone should feel comfortable with their pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them are going.
It doesn't work with just the one thing I bought today
Obviously, the chair had a hidden defect which was not apparent when sold.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
Try it on #PRS_ORG# first.
This has been working for about
Not more than 14 days.
Therefore, I have been buying my books online and reading them on #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none.
They are now available and I would like you to please add two chairs to my order and send me the bill.
[CW] The feeling of not being able to help.
Warning: this article contains details of domestic abuse.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons on a regular basis.
A topic that really gets to me and happens far too often is that many victims don't want help or think we can't help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that get to me more than if I can't do something about it.
I see the blue marks, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation with the perpetrator, far away from prying eyes and ears, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving one's social circle, fear of snatching the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes with tears in my eyes, is that everyone deserves to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to accept abuse.
I often wish I could do more... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please always keep in mind that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
“Arcane” on Netflix: What is the series about “League of Legends”?
There is a lot of fantasy, many complicated names, and an amazing design: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick could be relied on.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants in Crailsheim lost – and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg’s coach John Patrick spoke about the cup defeat at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October: “We still have some anger in our stomachs”.
However, after the game, she did not lay down – on the contrary, she increased her efforts in light of the 61:72 (28:38) basketball Bundesliga defeat.
In other words, more than the bare result, it was the manner of the appearance that was disappointing.
A representative statistic, which expresses the whole dilemma: The three-point percentage was just 13 percent, 4 goals (all by young Johannes Patrick) from a total of 31 attempts – any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "After winning in Tenerife, we were simply not concentrated enough and did not implement what we had trained".
To move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim, on the other hand, reacted in a completely different way: "Another great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time", said the happy coach.
It felt like there were 10,000 people in the room.
Only 750 spectators were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they were not disappointed.
Not least because of BBL top-scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game of his team.
Gleim praised him as ‘the best playmaker I have ever trained’.
While Patrick's team failed to get any points from the likes of Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7).
In the last quarter (minute 22:15) only, the giants prevented a total debacle and came within 8 points, after having been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points.
Luckily, there's not much time to wallow in self-pity.
Already on Wednesday (7.30 p.m.), the giants will be hosting the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different e-mail address, but I changed it.
Yes, I registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have consulted our lawyers again and have written to them again as a result.
We registered our interest originally six months ago.
Always as good as it gets: Max Raabe turns 59
He can charm his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is travelling with the programme ‘Good Morning, Sweet Fortune’ – if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been rescheduled for May 2022 – “at the behest of the authorities”, to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
Other concerts he had planned for the Advent season will also have to be postponed, as it says on the singer’s website (www.palast-orchester.de), which celebrates his 59th birthday today.
The artists want to make up for the postponed dates from 2020 due to the pandemic from January.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot since he was young.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has won numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He has managed to catapult himself from niche to mainstream.
Max Raabe is always elegantly dressed, his blonde hair is neatly combed, and he pays attention to etiquette. He cannot be ignored from the current German-speaking music scene.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" programme. dpa

Federal Housing Minister Klara Geywitz: Through expropriation, no new homes are created
The new Federal Minister for Building and Urban Development, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
"With expropriation, not a single new home is created, it just changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My objective is to give tenants peace of mind that their rent will remain affordable over the next few years.
A colourful mix of private landlords, co-operatives or housing associations, for example, is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Green Party and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission to discuss how to deal with the outcome of the popular vote.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP in the coalition over further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement stipulates a rent cap until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tough housing markets, and an expansion of the rent index.
I will speak to the Attorney-General to see if we can implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not loosen up, "we will discuss further steps with our coalition partners," stressed the SPD politician.
Hi, I wanted to order something and realised a few days later that I had forgotten the last step in the payment process.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.

It is a complete outrage
At least 100 tornado deaths in Kentucky
A devastating tornado system has produced numerous tornadoes across the U.S.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 fatalities.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
Multiple tornadoes ripped through the U.S. overnight Saturday, causing widespread destruction and possibly up to a hundred deaths.
The storms have left a swath of destruction about 320 km wide, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear, who toured the disaster area, said that everything was gone everywhere the tornado passed.
Houses, shops, government buildings - wiped out.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs hanging from trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He is expecting up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are increasing by the hour.
Hi, I just saw that they don't have Vitrine #NUMBER# in stock.
It's very sad.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the catalogue?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in a different country?
until when do you want to register?
If the delivery cannot be made to my home, I will cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the cover and have it shipped to Germany, which is in my shopping cart?
I returned an item via the contact form, or requested a return, and wanted to check if it had been received or processed, as I have not received a confirmation yet.
Companies Pay Bonuses for Vaccination and Change Slogans
While the Federal Government is continuing to reject the proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering financial incentives to their employees to get vaccinated.
They are in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives to get vaccinated.
The transformation of advertising slogans into calls to get vaccinated – based on the German model – is also intended to increase willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19.
He switched companies and made fun of them.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He has obviously not sewn himself in at his old post, and has been looking for something else.
You can too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't really matter.
He didn't like his job, either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will then be relevant from a legal point of view.
I'm taking a screenshot.

Help with your first campaign
Boron, say hello!
I am currently running an adventure for a group of four friends, Over the Gryphon's Pass, and I want to seamlessly integrate my heroes into a campaign I am writing specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is in place, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been invented, and now I'm in the process of writing the prologue and I'm already stumbling over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes have to deliver a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
That is where the story will continue to unfold.
Some miles from the village, a group of goblins lay in wait for the heroes, leading them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in a variety of ways: through persuasion, through action, through intimidation, through detecting the threat early on, whatever the players can think of.
Strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and shields
Unseen, the goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a hedge bank, and flank the wagon with three archers on the left and right, while two spearmen hold the wagon in place.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
1. The heroes will all be unconscious, and will be found and healed by the son of the village blacksmith, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, gone.
2. If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf with two of his servants will join the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything super.
How do you feel about Deus ex Machina's solution 2?
Is the encounter too much of an adventure to start with?
Goblins will play a part later on, so they're not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially so many great suggestions and tips.
I will absolutely be taking on board a lot of your ideas, and I'm now feeling much more confident in my storytelling.
I took the lamp apart again.
And back together again.
Sadly, it still doesn't work.
So I would still like to send them back
Can you then send the tail lights back so I can package up the light and send it to #PRS_ORG#?

Will everything be collected again or just the storage space?
I am irritated by Sky Sport F1
Hello F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality of German Sky has steadily declined, so I’m going to use this post to vent my frustration.
First, coverage was briefly interrupted during the F2 race today to bring viewers up to speed with F1 build-up.
While the schedule was far behind the planning due to the delayed start and the launch accident, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision!
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons F1 has priority and everything else has to give way, so Sky DE had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially as Sky UK were showing it live.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: Commentator Olivier Zwartyes has done a good job covering the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident.
Then there was the rule infringement of the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, who did not know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
While this situation has arisen at Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, it was not until after a radio message from Hamilton that it was confirmed that Verstappen could change his tyres.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that Verstappen had this opportunity.
I think it is important to know these basic rules if you are commentating on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
This is not the first time there has been ambiguity about what is or is not allowed according to the rules, both of which have constant uncertainty about the rules.
In general, Roos's affected comment style does not appeal to me, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste.
But seriously, I find Heiko Wasser from RTL even better.
In addition, there are constant jokes that make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or Ralf Schumacher's "UuuuuHD".
The latter, in particular, brings a lot of commotion to the comment, which clearly does not take it seriously.
In particular, the advertising is simply taking over at Sky: in the final stages, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes to air with advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where the German commentary track has to make do without commentary after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Both of these channels show less advertising during training than Sky, even though they are free-to-air channels.
I have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but this does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 schedule is also very poor and full of repeats.
In general, Sky is really the worst pay-TV broadcaster showing F1.
Ironically, RTL does a better job of being serious about the four races they are still allowed to show.
So, at least, makes the fantastic F1 season a lot less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
What's your opinion?
Here you go: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hi, I ordered an article that was supposed to be delivered last week, but it still hasn't arrived.
I have emailed them twice and have not received a response.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never did.
Hi, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric had a hole in the front part of the chair).
I need help.
Air pumps are a great way to add oxygen to your aquarium.
It is also possible to run a filtration system in conjunction with a belt conveyor.
This series is available in 3 variants from us.
Check the results table at the bottom of the page.
There, you can see the results side by side.
If the pumps are strong enough, they can power entire facilities.
If you have a large aquarium, a pump with 2 or more outlets will allow you to connect multiple diffusers to it.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. Fans can also be used to set an accent in an aquarium, e.g. with a curtain (available in our shop) or with decor that turns the bubbles into a function.
A treasure chest, pearl or something similar should be mentioned here.
The MK series has a special sound-dampened construction, which ensures low operating noise.
It is very easy to install.
The centrifugal pump is connected to a rubber hose 4/6 mm in diameter to an outlet ... and it's ready to go.
The water pump should be the same height, or higher, than the water level and outside the tank.
If the water pump sits lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed to prevent backflow.
Just cut the air hose and put a valve in between.
This would prevent backflow if water ever did happen to flow the wrong way, which would suck water out of the tank through the pump...
If the fan pump is located outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other pumps
The MK pump series are pure muscle, consuming little energy
Even though eBay states the processing time as 3 days, the goods are packed every day and the packages are picked up every day.
Everything goes well while you're running, it's very fast.
We just want to take a precaution so that nobody is out of tune, even if it takes a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone understands all the employees who work in the logistics sector...of course this doesn't stop for Corona.
Please don't write a bad review right away, just because the delivery is delayed. This is solely the fault of the courier companies.
Of course, you chide these services naturally, even though we're saying...they have it tough right now
This varies from region to region.
Be kind, stay safe, and we're all hoping for better days to come.
How long does it take to get the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Is it possible to get light-colored legs here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends daughter of an astronaut and a presenter into space
The daughter of the first US astronaut in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system of the Blue Origin company founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
In brilliant blue skies, Bezos himself greeted the newly minted astronauts upon their return.
“Welcome back,” said Bezos, clad in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch of the capsule.
In front of the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers stepped out one after the other and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were travelling for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were special guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not reveal how much each paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembers her father's mission after his short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself on his missions.
She just came along for the ride, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space as soon as possible, the moderator said.
New Shepard flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometres
The New Shepard rocket system flies mostly automatically.
The capsule detached from the rocket during the flight and reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times in weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed.
The International Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was the third manned flight for Blue Origin: the first was in July, with Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October saw the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing space tourism at the expense of scientific research into making space travel beneficial to humanity, and with little regard for the environmental impact.

Someone who works or studies biochemistry
I am currently in my first semester studying biochemistry, and I find the subject in itself quite interesting, and the lab work does not bother me (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical course).
Of course, I have researched my career prospects before starting my studies. However, at that time I also thought that I would definitely like to complete my PhD.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially with respect to my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc), you always hear super career opportunities and that the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
So, I'm really interested in this:
What kind of work are you doing at the moment?
2) Are you happy with your work/salary?
3) What have you studied/what qualifications do you have?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am really unsure at the moment and I am thinking of possibly breaking off my studies in 2022 and training to be a specialist computer scientist.
If you have any experience in this area, please feel free to share it with us.
Extra stress before holidays and weekends
This issue came up last week with me.
But now I have to use my long weekend to unwind.
That's why we only got the goalpost now.
Not only during the big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress at our workplace.
As it seems, there are also plus days during holidays.
It was like this: Last week was Mary's Ascension, which we call "Ascension" here in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses get a half-day off, as it's officially a holiday.
So last weekend there was a long 4-day weekend.
So, what happened last week?
It's a very stressful time.
There were a lot of emails that had to be dealt with urgently before the ramp-up, order after order, everything *urgently* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Why ‘next week’ doesn’t sound right after so much time has passed, and it can’t?
Or is it because people genuinely expect more from a condensed week than they do from a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, I was really irritated.
What is the point of this self-imposed captivity for the sake of holidays?
Why have we then got holidays if we can't really enjoy them?!
The stress, however, did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simply: Is it just us Swiss who are like that?
Is that our reformed-evangelical way of doing things?
Or do you know this in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing is, even if there's no snow in Erfurt, you can just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer to Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the spirit of the season by baking and crafting with her son.
"I love it," Catterfeld said.
Before the thoughtful days, she still has a lot to do: "I still haven't got any gifts, I have to get started now for the first time".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and regeneration of feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg of Biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth, shiny plumage.
The majority of feather defects in poultry husbandry are exclusively attributable to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the feathers consist of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect feather coat.
To have a functioning metabolism, the daily food intake must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the mortality during moult is due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or deficiencies in vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is specifically taken into account and balanced.
While using NEKTON-Bio, do not administer any other vitamin preparations.
NEKTON-Bio is cold-water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thanks, I found it
It still doesn't work.
DDR model of handicraft Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME Heft 11/1968, used with wear and tear and missing parts, see photos, the locomotive works well, the E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for pulling heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the set was also produced by the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is being overhauled
In 1924, Deutsche Reichsbahn Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could haul 2,200 tonne coal trains and 530 tonne passenger carriages at speeds of up to 45 km/h on this line.
A top speed of 65 km/h was demanded.
Thus, the DRG decided in March 1926 on the delivery of the 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, and Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
Six locomotives were delivered from December 1927 to June 1928, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
They all survived the Second World War and found themselves again on the territory of the future GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were brought to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Reichsbahn Repair Works in Dessau, all six locomotives were found to be suitable for overhaul.
[4] As the need for locomotives for heavy freight traffic increased with the further electrification of the central German network, the three locomotives E 95 01, E 95 02 and E 95 03 were overhauled in 1959. The other locomotives were used as spare parts donors.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in large numbers, were built first.
It was not until it was clear that it would not be possible to increase the rehabilitation quota for E 94 that E 95 came into focus for rehabilitation.
[4] At first, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own train schedule, running mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal heading to Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt.
It was found that the complicated control of the locomotives became problematic with increasing age.
It was not uncommon for the shooter to get stuck during a switch.
Then the fireman, who was constantly riding on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and a chisel to release the shooters during the trip.
Damage to the traction motors occurred more frequently and led to months-long failures of the locomotives.
[5] Since enough new locomotives were available at the end of the 1960s and there were no plans to expand the electrified network at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of their subtypes, so that the E 95 were withdrawn from service.
In addition to this, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to employ one person to operate their electric locomotives, which would have been a problem in train operations due to the difficulties with the machines and poor visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid-1969, E 95 01 was the last to be retired, on 5 October 1970.
The intended new name, 255 001, was never used.
All locomotives were dismantled, except for E 95 02.
E 95 02 was set up as a track heating system in place of the future museum locomotive E 77 10 in Halle Hauptbahnhof.
It took some time to convince those in charge of the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive was initially dealt with on the outside in order to be able to present it at a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986 the locomotive was internally completed.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is cared for as a museal object.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on making the locomotive operational.
In April 2015, the locomotive was first presented at an exhibition at the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer coat of paint, where the transformers were checked and five traction motors were operational.
- The locomotives were used on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branches until 1945, where they proved their reliability and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German Network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, Function good, it is necessary to carry out optical work on the locomotive in your own time, dusty, with play marks, musty smell in the cellar !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition – perhaps the set was also produced by the small-series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and warehouse marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part of it.
The beam is supported on two feet...unfortunately these are too short and the beam will not sit on the feet.
What's going to happen now?
I can't put the bed together.
The beam is supported on two feet, unfortunately these are faulty.
The crossbar does not fit into the intended slot.
So, I get new ones sent in.
When will they be sent out?
No, not flat.
These are the right ones according to the assembly instructions, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't really matter.
The main thing is that they do their job.
They are not flat in my case
Could you have sent this to me?
Hi #NAME#, do you need me to explain the problem again?
House fire with two mildly injured and a high damage
Two people were mildly injured in a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, a damages estimate in the six-figure euro range was incurred, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were taken to hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday, according to reports.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not suspect foul play.
The criminal investigation department of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
That arrives much later, though
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To counter fake news – Biontech CEO publishes a vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Until now, Biontech managing director Uğur Şahin had not spoken publicly about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo of his Covid-19 vaccination.
The illness of a friend had prompted him to do so, shared Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainzer company Biontech, Ugur Sahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a Covid-19 vaccination.
There was misinformation on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday on the LinkedIn network.
"For months now, friends have been urging me to post a picture of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumours."
So far, he has rejected this, as he did not want the communication to revolve around him.
But a phone call last week had changed his mind: "I was deeply upset to hear that an old school friend of mine was currently fighting for his life.
He is struggling with a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, wrote Şahin.
He didn't ask why.
"The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often stoked by inaccurate information and mistrust."
It is hard to fight fear with facts. Sometimes it is better to share one's own experience.
In the internet, there is an interview with Deutsche Welle circulating, in which Ugur Sahin says that he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
It is currently not legal for me to get the vaccine myself’, said Şahin at the time.
There is a priority system in place for administering the vaccine in Germany.
The prioritisation has been lifted for some time now – and according to his own statements, the BioNTech CEO has had himself vaccinated three times.
Fire in transformer substation: Ten thousand people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had disabled an electrical substation.
After a fire with severe damage to a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the district of Rhein-Sieg in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 residents in several communities affected by the fire.
Supplier Westnetz reported that numerous standby generators had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption was completely rectified late in the evening.
Firefighters and volunteers from the Technical Help Force provided support in the communities.
Authorities offered school-based childcare and appealed for neighbourly help.
The supplier thanked those affected for their patience, and the helpers for their efforts.
We fully recognise that the last 24 hours have been extremely challenging.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades, and the volunteers of the Technisches Hilfswerk for their untiring efforts," said Florian Witt, Head of the Department of Primary Technology, in a press release on Saturday evening.
The repairs will take several days, since the Westnetz technicians were only able to temporarily reconnect some lines, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to the company.
The current is flowing again
According to Westnetz, the fire, which broke out on Friday at around 19:15, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching station in Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
There are extensive cleaning and repair works needed there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
This bypass allowed the power supply to be re-established.
Since Saturday at 18:00, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected at 21:30.
Since 11:15pm, those who were previously affected by the power cut have also had electricity.
More than 80 Westnetz technicians and partner firms were on the job.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighbourly help.
"It is now important that citizens take care of older or lonely people in their neighbourhood and let the local fire brigades know if help is needed," explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus was on residents of old people's homes when it came to setting up and operating standby generators.
Additionally, according to authorities, there were temporary care facilities set up in schools for those who were unable to care for themselves or needed electricity-dependent medical devices or were dependent on medical care.
Good afternoon!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in euros?
It is the blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you are also having a nice day and stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the underside on the tabletop.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 variations of this.
We wanted to serve those with tabletops of #NUMBER#
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG arrived, but I can't squeeze these into one another, so I can't shorten it.
Can you help me?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for that purpose.
I would be happy to receive feedback.
Yeah, that's really easy!
So, let's do it!
Can you send me the return label by e-mail?
The repairs are now complete.
I had tried to do this before the chat.
Before buying, however, I did not restart the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do it now?
I find it almost outrageous to give such a low credit.
We are not happy with that.
Nordic Combined: Riiber Wins in the Combined
The German Nordic combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid made it onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to give up again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country race with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of the job number #NUMBER#
When will my money be refunded into my account?
Yes, we have both done a new translation and are using version 4.5...
Maybe they've heard about problems before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG, it seems they are okay with it.
When I try to open it, I get an error message, ups!
This document cannot be opened.
File may be corrupt, report it to customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is an #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help?
What do you do when the chat disconnects?
I have to work sometimes!
To get an even and clean coat, you should clean the parts with some soapy water, rinse it with clear water and dry it.
It's a good idea to practice 2-3 strokes before dipping your brush into a new color for the first time.
You can do this on the underside of the components, which will later be covered over, or on a yoghurt pot.
The first mark on the component
Draw even strokes with the brush.
The slight overlap of color layers later results in a smooth surface.
Avoid wiping back and forth with the brush.
This results in unrealistic looking areas.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones might otherwise show through.
Metallic tones and metallic colours are finished with a separate brush at the end.
Otherwise, you can get unsightly metallic streaks if you mix the paint with a normal colour.
Allow the decorated pieces to dry for a day before assembling.
The models achieve a true-to-life look with the decals/transfer sheets.
From aircraft registration marks to ship names, decals add the finishing touch to model kits.
Arrange the decals in the right order while they are still easy to touch.
An aircraft's cockpit can be removed and replaced more easily than the fuselage.
More important than having the right tools, such as scissors, tweezers or a toothpick, is time, patience and a steady hand when it comes to stickering.
Cut each desired decal individually and arrange them to your liking.
Decals are also known as waterslide decals because you have to wet the back of them with water until the transfer paper turns dark.
Then just push the image a little bit onto the paper, and place the sheet on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moisturized beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you peel the carrier paper off to the side.
Attention: Check first if the image is in the right place before fully peeling it off the paper, so that it does not stick to your fingers, crinkle or even tear.
Use a household cloth to absorb the excess water.
Warning: Not suitable for children under 3 years old
I can only briefly open a book if I look at something else, then I can't read the book anymore and have to log in and log out and load the book again and search for the place where I stopped reading.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do you send this by email?
For all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 separate packages.
Thanks anyway!
Then I'll shop elsewhere once I get my money back.
But will I be able to get it back without any problems?
In-vitro fertilization for couples with private health insurance / What does "insured event" mean?
Hi,
We have been undergoing fertility treatment for some time, and now, when it comes to settling the bill with the statutory health insurer, it is suddenly putting its foot down.
Step by step:
We had the fertility clinic at the PKV beforehand and received confirmation for 3 attempts.
The trials were not in any way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth, and was invoiced to the patient’s health insurance.
Some time later, we tried for a second child, and underwent 2 (unsuccessful) IVF cycles, but hadn't yet counted these towards the cost of our private health insurance.
We reapplied for cost coverage from the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After several attempts (we did more tests than agreed, of course the most expensive ones will be reimbursed by the PKV), we sent the bills to the PKV and got a nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The rationale: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts from the first acceptance are withdrawn.
The second wish for a child is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "the insurance event begins with the medical treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions for the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be reimbursed) or us (5 attempts will be reimbursed)?
* Did the private health insurance have to warn us that any further attempts would be forfeited with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insured event?
Infertility (caused by blocked tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thanks for your help so far!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can get back to them?
Okay.
We will not place any more orders with them.
Somehow, if you add up the sales of me and my boyfriend #NAME# (same address), they must have lost a good customer.
Feel free to pass that along to your manager.
This is not compatible with competition.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment was made, but now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't do anything about it if the dresser comes completely unhinged to me
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
Here it states clearly that the repayment was triggered and I still have not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you've lost two regular customers.
My boyfriend has also ordered various pieces of furniture for our flat via his account.
We're not going to do that now.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell them as office chairs.
Regardless, there is a 24-month guarantee.
No, I cannot provide an alternative packaging.
I will disassemble the cupboard so that it can be transported by the removal company.
Good afternoon, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are promoted with additional seating, but unfortunately we cannot find any at your premises.
Can you help?
Weekly theme: The best low-budget films
What exactly a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are many lists of low-budget films on the web, e.g. Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What do you find so exciting about it?
And what didn't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, and I have completely furnished two flats with your furniture.
I was enquiring about the best price for the grey leather sofa at Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thanks for that
Best regards
If there is no phone number, no chat, where you have to wait 30 minutes, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing has changed about the waiting position...I will soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hi
A "half-victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can claim a "half-victory" in the conflict with the Belarussian regime.
However, the costs are very high and represent a massive violation of the rights of migrants and refugees on the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not managed to resolve the confrontation in a sustainable way, explained the researcher from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).
This state of limbo – Belarus doesn’t give up completely, but the EU feels like a winner – will probably continue for a while.
The way people are treated at the border is not compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, said Bossong.
It appears that there has been an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by some EU member states.
Since the EU as a whole has not taken a stand against this, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakened the cohesion in the Union.
"She can't seem to get her way when a member state decides to do its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which is not even allowing Frontex, the EU border protection agency, to gain access to the border."
In addition, the EU is paying a price for its policy at the Belarusian border, according to Bossong: An agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult because the "border protection, border protection, border protection" line has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
Meanwhile, according to information from Poland's border guard, migrants have once again tried to get into Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested and brought back to the border overnight on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
Polish officials were pelted with stones by migrants during the incident near Czeremsza.
A soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor, according to reports.
In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already managed to overcome the border barriers on Friday night.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU, or attempted to do so, over the past few months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler of Minsk, of luring them into the EU with the prospect of visa-free travel.
Poland and Lithuania have reportedly sealed off certain sections of the border.
The EU has sanctioned Belarus, and threatened airlines that fly migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response, according to Bossong, is the pressure on the airlines.
"Here, the EU has thrown its weight around on the market and demonstrated its determination to operate with a hard line and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account the domestic political costs.
It seems that Belarusian society is not prepared for the fact that the security agencies regularly herd thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen, according to Mercedes, committed two infractions during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows are suspected of flouting two rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
This refers to a perceived transgression by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last phase under the safety car, when he is alleged to have illegally overtaken.
A second appeal was lodged against the stewards' classification at the finish of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes in the last round, and had raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the cars ahead of him.
I'll look into it.
I will speak to the bank and get back to you
Thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fantag
The Europa-Park, which lends its name to the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited fans to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announced, members and permanent card holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
There were also vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coasters lit up red and white on this day.
Foxes, Ed Euromice and lots of red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The collaboration between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park, it was shown again how well the partnership fits.
Shining fans can be seen having fun together on the roller coaster, says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "At Home"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note and acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a coastal house and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I submitted a contact form yesterday to return an item, but have not received an email confirmation or anything.
My question is whether my request has been accepted.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and the wrongly delivered cheap Chinese crap.
Your mistake to correct and not all from our household.
Please contact #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I/we would receive an email with a £60 voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside cabinet and a return label.
That email hasn't come yet.
The package wants to deliver to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me.
Best regards

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an antisemite, it doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an AfDler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah reproduces antisemitic messages on a regular basis.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just let it go completely.
Yes, you are as much to be taken with as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the theory of evolution is completely lost.
In any case, a god started it all.
But once you become a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old, and that all science is nothing but foolishness.
And that makes you an enemy of science, and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
To get the best field of vision, the lens should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specifically apochromatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the loupe with practically no distortion or colour fringing right up to the edge.
Magnifying glasses often have an indication of the magnification.
This is only true in very exact conditions, which are seldom the same as the intended use.
To make the best use of your magnifying glass, please pay attention to the information in the "Technical data" table (see the user instructions in the packaging).
On the surfaces of all optical devices – including telescopes – light reflections occur.
By using an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
In ideal conditions of use – with the magnifying glass close to the eye – reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information is provided in the accompanying user instructions (in German and English).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz, women search for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has witnessed some strange situations when it comes to selling Christmas trees.
Once a man even drove home without his partner, because they couldn't agree on anything.
Every year, he plants around 2,000 of them.
The 56-year-old has experienced so many bizarre situations.
This always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit funny, he says.
And the voucher?
Am I going to be chucked out as a customer?!
I mean, I got a defective product, and now I have to pay full price for it.
Then I will judge accordingly!
We don't need to have a discussion about which is the better court, but there are some similarities between the two.
They both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
So both have their name.
In German, an equivalent would be something like a "wheel", which doesn't sound nearly as good.
Problems with fibre optic cable + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable WiFi network.
I previously had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly with 50 Mbit reception and transmission, with the exception of a few failures.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLAN module, which transmits the WiFi signal, is no longer receiving the full 500, but the more I move away from the module, the less I receive (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This results in the internet being even slower in the first floor with the new fibre optic connection (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than DLan, but here too there were large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" through the electrical cable?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to run LAN cables in the house.
I am at my wit's end trying to figure out why I would go through the trouble of creating an account specifically for this site.
Therefore, I would be very happy to receive a response.
When it's time to switch your current account
Anyone who thought that now there would be peace and quiet about the current accounts will be disappointed.
While many banks have used the autumn to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the threshold for negative interest rates is also falling.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a threshold of 100,000 euros.
She has simply halved the tax-free allowance and quadrupled the interest on savings.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers in the Postbank division – to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
However, these lower thresholds now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, a spokesperson confirmed on request.
And not just for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros previously, which is still in place, as is the case with ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the threshold twice, first to 50,000 euros and then to 25,000 euros.
At least: According to figures from internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have a threshold of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which, in the first instance, have been given the right by the Regional Court of Berlin against this regulation.
Now, the banks are discussing whether they should perhaps set aside reserves – in case the top courts rule that negative interest rates are in principle unlawful and millions of bank customers have to have their money repaid.
They delivered the wrong table for 8 people instead of the correct one for 6.
The undercarriage is for six people.
Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army on her payroll
She now officially sits at the top of Hollywood.
It's a rollercoaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
There is a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers to look after their appearance.
At least, according to Aniston, they allow themselves one chip a day (yes, you read that right: ONE chip from the packet).
It's a miracle that their hearts still soar equally for female and male fans.
Maybe because she is simply unlucky in love - and is still looking for her one and only.
And he has removed the baby wish from the list.
She was constantly asked when she was going to have a baby.
It hurt her.
People who ask these questions have no clue about what's going on with me personally, medically, as to why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
It is hoped that success and fame will also make one happy.
An ignominious end to a career: Räikkönen calls it quits
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 turned out to be quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a mistake and slight touch with the wall, Raikkonen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after less than half of the race distance during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the king of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and the two children also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say their farewells.
Kimi Raikkonen's biggest success was winning the world championship in 2007 for Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix, started from pole 18 times and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich gets his 60th World Cup win - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sports
The goal for the bobsleigh pilot is to beat the record of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes.
"I've worked it out, I need to get nine and a half wins per season to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic gold medallist from BSC Oberbärenburg, who won two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he defended against the attack of Johannes Lochner on Saturday by five hundredths of a second, by going from third to first.
He then changed the material settings and took a bigger lead with 0.3 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Briton Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We went for a bigger risk today and were rewarded, said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd victory in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth this time after coming second previously.
Christoph Hafer from the BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won her third victory of the season in the women's two-woman bobsleigh in her home run.
After coming fourth in the one-woman monobob on the previous day, she raced to victory in the German team sprint with Deborah Levi on Sunday, winning the World Cup.
Two-man bob winner Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She earned her first medal of the winter on the way to qualifying for the Olympics.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki and Leonie Fiebig landed in third place.
It was super cool for me to be on the podium for the first time in the World Cup. I am super happy that Mariama is with me.
I am very happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt, emphasizing: "It's not just pulling, but there is a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little irritated by the not entirely error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the decks in my cart and was ready to buy them!
What should I do?
I haven't received it, so I can't redeem it, which is why I am finally asking.
Last year, due to Covid-19, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now it says it has expired, which I am very annoyed about.
Check the chat, it was about Asare's bench.
I want to return it and then reorder it as it's on sale right now :)
Why is shipping only starting on 16th March?
Nothing on your website said there would be such long delivery times
No, not until you start typing will there be an extra field with the message
It was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this an issue today?
I also sent you the picture of the wrong part that was delivered.
But we still want the shelving unit, just a new undamaged one
And don't cancel the entire order.
It's only today, it's only this week, it's only until XY...
Hi, great girls and women,
I have a lot I want to say, and maybe it will resonate with some people...
I'm 24, I have PTSD, I'm a full-time student, and I'm a dog-mom - besides the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to pre-school, he's pretty much my child.
My boyfriend (we've been together for 6 years) is ill, sustained a 2nd degree burn on Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
I visited him yesterday because I also have emotional needs, and I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (as his hand was bandaged because of a burn).
He is also cool, and we see each other less (1-2 times a week), which is very difficult for me because of my need for affection and love.
My puppy just had an upset stomach, I cooked for him, and now he's lying in his cosy blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heating pad and cuddles.
I live with my sister and my mother, and she's going to be away for a month.
Now we have to do the housework, which we will of course split up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is doing really well right now, I'm halfway decent-therapied, and I'm managing.
It's not good, but I'm managing and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university demands a lot (of me), tomorrow at 15:00 there will be a written test I haven't done yet, and next day there will be anatomy class I should prepare at least a little bit for.
And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and then what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room left in there.
So, my week goes like this: I've only got until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But what happens after that?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just stressed right now, so I need those mental reminders because otherwise I can't handle it.
I somehow feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am eternally grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly in awe, words can't describe how grateful I am.
I don't know if I would have survived KPtBs otherwise.
I think it has something to do with the mental load on women and that is why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
Anyway, I wish you a restful evening; we're almost at the end of the week!
I received my order today, unfortunately it is a different colour, plus the surface is scratched and there is a mark on the table leg.
In the first delivery, the colour was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
So, if we swap the table, can I get a different colour or something?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In other words, twice.
It was not confirmed, however.
It was something completely different: in school, I found out that many religion teachers do not believe in God, and it is just another subject like maths or geography for them.
It was always something strange to me, maybe because I was brought up in a Christian environment and I always somehow believed in it.
What's your take on it?
You might also consider talking to some of your work or study peers about their experiences.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional, and it is sensible to separate them.
There is a curriculum, etc.
But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who didn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What would make someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Cultural heritage or something like that?
I hope that your question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed, or not? Please write in English, which I also understand.
That's been going on for a long time, so I'd avoid that
It's good, thank you.
I am expecting a response in the near future, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help with the film search
Hi, guys.
I am looking for a film from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
There are two time-axes (or parallel worlds) in the movie.
On the one hand, there is modernity (the real world).
On the other hand, it refers to the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure).
Since I can't describe it in real life, there is a young woman.
And in the land of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean).
Somebody has to cross paths with somebody for something to happen.
The antagonist is also a soldier of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this dead world so he can live, I presume.
I think the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, I think both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If you can translate this from de to en, I would be very grateful.
Our little one has only slept on her tummy from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive
Relax.
This child is much tougher than you might think.
Make sure everything else is right, no cuddly toys, pop in and check regularly but no clock watching.
It drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
A good mattress.
No pillows.
Ah, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child while he or she is sleeping.
Did you turn your head to the side?
Can it sit up on its own?
Or is it face down on the mattress?
This will tell you whether everything is okay.
We all grew up with it, and when my husband was born, it was common to lay babies on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already your "regulars" and have already bought a lot of articles from you.
But why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hi, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and haven't had a response yet.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right-wing drawer doesn't fit into the cupboard.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is not currently in use.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know that not everything can be held up.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that politics on that station has gotten completely out of hand.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then to go begging at the same time.
It was said to be an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Arno's quote: "We don't want to be a newsstand that's always running."
What's going on?
A 0815 advertising channel that tries to get its merchandise to the elite fans.
And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts.
They naturally apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They can of course continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and tries to make a mess of the situation by renting an exploded space at the expense of the action.
How am I supposed to feel good about all of this?
It's great if you like it; I find it abhorrent.
I would like to request a call back as my delivered wooden table was defective.
Broken body from defective delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comfort when you have stomach ache, or just for cuddling – my little warm friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Chamomile pillows are a traditional home remedy used for soothing aching muscles and joints, as chamomile is a good conductor of heat and can provide targeted heat.
The removable inner cushion can be easily warmed up in a microwave or oven.
The soft contact makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe even when they are not in a good mood.
The cherry hull pillow with cover is only suitable for heating applications in the following areas:
Check for an unusual odour, stain or burn mark before heating the mattress, and dispose of it immediately if one is found.
Please remove the inner cushion for heating from the cover first!
Heat in a microwave oven for a maximum of 2 minutes at 300 watts (follow the instructions of the microwave oven manufacturer)!
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the pillow by shaking it!
Then place the inner cushion back into the cover.
In the early stages of heating, a slight amount of moisture may form on the surface, but this will dissipate after a few applications.
Always refer to the heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy consumption can cause damage (risk of fire and explosion)!
Check that heating a pillow in a microwave oven is allowed before doing so, as not all grain products can be heated in a microwave oven.
After the heated pad is returned to the cover, please check the temperature of the pad to see if it is suitable for babies (max. 43°C).
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as for people with decreased pain sensitivity.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or cancer conditions, or if you are pregnant, please consult a doctor before use.
If the seams are open and the kernels are coming out, throw the product away and keep the kernels out of children's reach.
For babies under 1 year old, check the temperature of the baby regularly during use to avoid overheating!
Any serious adverse event associated with the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the national authority in the country where the user is located.
The cover is removable and washable at 30°C in the washing machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt finish second in the first half of the season - Pauli win in Dusseldorf
Darmstadt 98 dreams of returning to the Bundesliga.
While Hannover 96 are working their way out of the relegation zone.
It is not going well for Ingolstadt either under the third coach.
There was jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the championship match, joy in Hanover over the interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut of the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ, around 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this one about five months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that just the power supply was enough to run it.
No such luck, the battery is dead and the laptop won't start even with the power cable plugged in.
Therefore, I removed the battery, but nothing happened.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop when it's connected to the internet?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like the delivery of #PRS_ORG# in my room.
How do I book?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# seat.
I don't know how high the seat is ...
How do you manage to be on the road a lot and still have all the equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
It can hold up to 20 litres and is large enough to accommodate even large photo equipment, which can be stowed away safely with the help of the padded FlexFold divider.
And everything else you need for everyday use can be stowed away in the individually configurable interior, which is easy to access and can be separated from the photo equipment.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has a reputation for being tough - Peak Design's Everyday Backpack series has developed some highly innovative solutions to keep the contents of your backpack safe, while still providing quick access to your camera gear.
This can be done in two ways: Once conventionally through the lid, which can be locked with the MagLatch system, an excellent solution for effective protection, which has already proved its worth with the messenger bags.
There is a metal locking pin in the closure, with a matching anchor on the front of the pack.
In contrast to most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of several "fill levels": there are four anchor bars, sturdily riveted, into which the locking hook can be inserted.
If the pack is full, just take the top crossbar; if it is empty, take the lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This ensures that the pack can be closed reliably without the hook catching.
The second option fundamentally differentiates the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional top-loading backpacks – you no longer have to rummage through your stuff!
At the same time, this clever detail makes the backpack much more user-friendly in daily life: If you're not only taking your photo equipment with you, but also everyday items or your suitcase.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can customise the interior (more on this below), so that both can be stowed away separately - and retrieved independently through the two side openings.
This way, you can also pull the pack from the right side, across your body, to access gear in the right main compartment while the everyday stuff stays safe in the left side of the pack and doesn't get in the way.
Comfortable, easy-to-adjust straps help.
And because the outer shell of the backpack is made from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, it will keep contents dry even if you're heading for Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# emailed me yesterday to confirm the appointment.
The courier has been in touch to arrange collection of the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any messages.
I request that this be dealt with immediately.
I am now writing to the third support person, and none of them have gotten me any further than promising to send me an email confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered #PRODUCT#
Is it possible that the wardrobe will be delivered again?
It's not an option for me to keep him...
It works.
Thank you so much for your help
Best of luck to you for the rest of the evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment on 12.1.21.
I received completely different light bulbs than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend my voucher, I will place a big order right away, but at least I will keep the damaged furniture and will not send it back.
And I could not have guessed that last year turned out differently than expected, and I was not able to claim it and clear it up in good time.
But as a customer, I don't accept that kind of damage.
Rotor brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic rider, who appreciates the reliability and safety of braking even in tough conditions.
Rotating brake discs are made from cast iron, and then mechanically worked (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in small series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
A bespoke production programme is drawn up based on the individual technical drawing, which takes account of the balancing of the wheel after the original mounting.
These tuned discs, produced in this way, ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional holes drilled increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the slots improve the cleaning of the brake discs and pads.
The aesthetic qualities of our tuned windscreen highlights the character of each car with an attractive and eye-catching appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event changed the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered a luminous rock in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, word soon got out and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of 1849.
Thousands came from near and far to make Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Sections were marked out, tents went up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted to get their share of the country’s wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or bust"!
In this game, you're a pioneer heading west to seek your fortune and make a name for yourself.
You will be looking for gold, recruiting workers, rounding up horses, and building businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river channels and adjacent areas.
You are not alone – the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to be better than your fellow pioneers or you're going to fail.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, manage your resources, and build a tableau that works for you (i.e. "engine building").
The buildings in your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or skew the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can fine-tune your playstyle to your liking.
Coloma plays for three years from 1848 (the year of the discovery of gold in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), and 1850 (the year California became a state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
At the start of each round, players secretly choose a location on the board where they want to perform an action.
They then reveal their selection and place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables half of the locations - reducing the number of possible actions that can take place there.
Players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, camping, panning for gold, building bridges, opening businesses, and placing gunfighters on the map.
After all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The booster turns at the start of each round to a new location, changing the available actions.
This continues until the counter has been moved five times, i.e. each location has been blocked once, and the year has ended.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an onslaught of bandits.
When the players have contributed enough gunfighters and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive less rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, and then the final score is tabulated.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I will take up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm (13.78 x 10.04 x 1.77 in) using the shipping type, Parcel (wrapped with a game).
For everything else, usually DPD insured and with package tracking (wrapped in foil, wrapped in paper).
If you are a collector, I can send it in a carton in a carton for a surcharge of 2 euros, so that there are 100% no pressure marks.
"Why children aren't tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, and abuse of power
The ARD documentary popped up in my Twitter timeline today and I watched it right away.
Michael Winterhoff, a child psychiatrist, is a frequent guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Kids Are Becoming Psychopaths" (2008), he triggered a fierce debate about education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please be careful; it's a difficult film to watch.
And I am very thankful that many people now think and act in a different way.
Never, never, never should parents or anyone else have power over a child!
Our goal must always be to provide the child with space for development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I still get chills.
Holetschek: The federal states are discussing the elimination of the testing requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times
The state health ministers want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for those who are triple vaccinated at their next meeting.
"We need clarity on whether and from when those who have been vaccinated three times can be exempted from testing," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), President of the Conference of Health Ministers, to Bild am Sonntag.
The removal of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has pledged that "he will submit a proposal to the Joint Committee on Health on Tuesday". - AFP
So I want to send the lamp back
How should I approach this?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Oops, we can't seem to find what you're looking for.
You can now shop online at #PRS_ORG#.
I have updated my account details.
What could this be due to?
What you describe as *awareness* is actually called *consciousness* under general anesthesia.
They occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Sounds/voices are most common, followed by images, and pain is least common.
This is relevant for this topic: Cesarean sections are an operation associated with a higher rate of awareness, as they avoid the need for general anesthesia to protect the newborn.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned at the time of anesthesia induction.
Specific anesthetic techniques such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) carry a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Everyone, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, however, u/Nitemarex by definition did not have it.
I must have misread her comment.
However, the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros do not help.
They are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to remove the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation, and is standard practice in e-commerce.
Please check that they at least return the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We lose out on a lot of money because of that.
I have already sent you an email, which you have not answered.
One more question.
In the order and on the receipt it says that the goods will be delivered to any room of my choice.
The courier is #NAME#.
I was just calling there.
They informed me that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that how it is?
If yes, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry heavy items up to the second floor.
Will I not be called?
I had a question in there
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He established himself as a theater critic and then as a director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man getting older".
The harrowing diary of a slow goodbye from the world, kept by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading it, you find out that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I hereby swear my life's gratitude."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is the Europalette, a standard wooden pallet used mainly in Europe as a load carrier.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to Statistics Austria, in 2020, over ten million pieces of pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
No figures are kept on how many pallets are imported to Austria each year
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in regular time against host team Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in a shoot-out with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York beat Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Loin Tips & Tricks
I received great advice here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
This was served at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and melt-in-the-mouth!
So thank you again :)
Now I've got a taste for it and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
In the morning, I will make a beef broth.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, I just have a big pot.
Where does that leave us now?
What about the books, or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I will manage
IEs is about a refund of #NUMBER#
I was informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund had been made.
But so far, the money has not reached me.
Please check that.
Where there is still Christmas roast in Lübeck
For many people, a goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as a Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not got any poultry?
It's getting close now.
We'll tell you where in Lübeck you can still get your hands on a Christmas roast.
The "drive" of a tube stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
The VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME knobs allow you to set the level as well as the saturation of your sounds.
In addition, VT+ amplifiers feature a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, it was already hinted that with the POWER LEVEL switch, even a power reserve can be conjured up quickly when it gets really loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone socket can also be used as a line input.
The signal here is being processed by a simulation box, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound even when using headphones or recording directly.
A CD or MP3 player can be plugged into the AUX socket so that you can jam along to your favourite songs.
A tuner is also on board - so you do not need a separate pitch control.
If you buy an additional VFS5 footswitch, you can call up the sounds with your feet, turn the effects on and off, and adjust the speed of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I've seen that with other people too.
Is there then a chance to send the lamp back?
Is it because it hangs too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help?
And the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hi, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I'll be happy with a discount or voucher.
Under the right circumstances, I might be able to find a buyer for the furniture.
More than 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit much, though.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if the screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the hook provided.
This is not a satisfactory answer, and the wait has not been worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear talks
According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"The two sides are close to agreeing on the issues on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the news agency IRNA on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", since at the beginning there was even no agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks aimed at reviving the agreement continued after a break of just under a week.
Iranian, German, British, Chinese, French, and Russian delegates are taking part in the talks.
A U.S. delegation is also in Vienna, but is not directly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - The Free State is now the region with the highest coronavirus infection rate
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and has the highest infection rate in Germany at the moment.
As the only state, its value is above 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia has been above the 1000 mark for coronavirus infection rates on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day incidence at 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always shown the highest infection rate nationwide, this figure was at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the 1000 mark.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus were reported within a day, and 16 additional deaths were reported in connection with an infection.
200 critically ill Covid-19 patients were cared for in intensive care units on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I see.
Since delivery is only expected at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the parcel, right?
Do I have to click/fill in anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, so I am writing to you.
I would like to arrange for the return at my own expense.
In my opinion, the 8 euro return fee is an act of cheek.
It's time for change
###MBundestag, greetings to you, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post office here?
If you look at the activity in the last few months of the Bundestag, you can see that it does not exist.
We had a winter freeze and stretched the summer gap for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
In essence, this is linked to dissatisfaction with how things have turned out, and with how we generally stand.
In recent days, the impression has been growing that many here still have a real interest in the Bundestag.
#Things we need to change
Here, the community around the Bundestag is being asked to keep this alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who had become aware of the project in the last few days and found, to put it mildly, a mess.
After some back-and-forth, a few folks from the community have stepped up to help rebuild the project.
However, I would like to explicitly invite everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have set up a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete things.
You can join the server here.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag work in the future?
* What existing arrangements need changing or adapting or removing?
How do we want to present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten something, but that's not a big deal, we have Discord at the end.
If you have interest and time, come to Discord, work with us and let's make democratic decisions about our future.
I have ordered a light shade from you, which will be delivered soon.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for my taste, and I don't like it.
I have already ordered another hanging from you.
I put it together and then noticed it when I took the soft foam out.
This is very sad.
I hope they will give it back and give me a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as #NAME# turned out much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, is there also a XXL version, i.e. 240/240 cm?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cupboard will be collected promptly.
And I implore you to do so now.
I don't have an appropriate packaging, I will disassemble the wardrobe as much as possible for pick-up - they have to figure out how that will work with #PRS_ORG#.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to arrange a collection date.
Is there an installation manual?
How long do I have to get this sorted/make a decision to return?
How do you respond when people ask why you're vegan?
Today, I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She used to live vegetarian for a while, and eats meat very seldom these days.
I myself have been a vegetarian for several years previously.
When asked if I've always wanted to be vegan, and that vegetarianism was a planned stepping stone, I answered honestly without much thought.
In particular, that I spent a long time thinking that being a vegetarian would somehow support animal welfare, but eventually reflected and understood that it actually supports animal cruelty.
That's why I decided to go vegan.
In that moment, I got the impression that they were annoyed, and they defended vegetarianism, saying that they knew where their meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Did I go too easy there?
How do you answer the question?
I feel that as a vegan you are quickly put into a corner and conflict arises without you looking for it.
It is greeted by a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Their #PRS_ORG# will not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be available on the assigned date #PRS_ORG# to collect my return.
Since I can't be there in person for the funeral, I'm afraid there's nothing that can be done about it.
Can you please assign an alternative pick-up date?
As of 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available on a permanent basis.
Lahnstein rescue force gets new equipment: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently, Rhineland Palatinate’s Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a subsidy certificate in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle for the volunteer fire department in Lahnstein at the Lahnstein Town Hall to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am happy that the state of Rhineland Palatinate is supporting us in this regard," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor, Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of seven units in Rhineland Palatinate.
They work on land and under water in search and rescue, water and ice rescue, and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are expecting a permanent increase in operations: the boom in river cruises on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the ongoing increase in the use of the Lahn as a recreational waterway, are contributing to this.
I bought a book I could only read 10%, and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I have followed their instructions to the letter, but nothing has worked. I have synced, deleted and reloaded the app, but nothing has worked.
I am a bit frustrated because this has taken up so much time already and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, I guess that’s how it is.
I would like to order three items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I specify a date when I place my order?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously mentioned values were measured in the Fenix laboratory at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity and with the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.
This will vary depending on the flashlight used, how old it is, and the environment.
*: The runtime in the "high" stage corresponds to the runtime with reduced brightness due to the overheat protection.
2) Merchants are responsible for their customers.
Customers should contact the retailers or distributors they purchased Fenix lights from with the "warranty card" from Fenixlight Limited and either a sales receipt or a delivery receipt for warranty support.
Fenix will provide our authorized dealers with the technology and parts required to maintain our lights.
1) 15-day free replacement: Fenix will replace a new product within 15 days of purchase if there is any quality problem during normal use.
We will replace it with the same model.
If the model is discontinued, customers will receive an equivalent or better model.
2) Free repair for 5 years: Fenix offers a free repair for lamps within 5 years from the date of purchase, if a problem occurs due to normal use.
Different warranty periods for different products:
With the exception of the products and accessories listed above, other products or free gifts from Fenix are not covered by the product guarantee.
3) Limited Lifetime Warranty: For lamps that have exceeded the free warranty period for repair, we offer lifetime repair, but charge parts.
The dealer informs the customer of the cost of the part before the repair.
4) Guarantee Certificate: Customers can lodge a claim against a Fenix dealer or retailer by presenting a completed Fenix guarantee card, a sales receipt or a receipt.
The distributor should offer services to the customers, and Fenix will support these services.
5) The free warranty does not cover any damage or failure caused by:
This covers any faults or damage resulting from misuse as well as faults or damage resulting from failure to follow the instructions or warnings in the user manual or product specifications.
For example, the specification for the sealed head states that it must not be disassembled, as this may damage the torch and invalidate the guarantee.
Any deficiencies or damage resulting from other behaviors cannot be appropriately controlled by Fenix.
6) For warranty claims, please contact our warranty department with the following information: Name, type / model of the warranty object, serial number.
First of all, thank you for standing up for what's right here. I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar capacity, that is, as a firearms carrier in the executive branch, so I won't comment any further on the matter!
I always find the question of right and left oversimplified.
In principle, it should be said that, of course, the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be obvious to everyone.
It should be obvious to everyone that, of course, uniforms and weapon bearers naturally attract people on the right-wing conservative side. However, it should be clear to everyone that these people naturally have a hard time dealing with the lived reality. After all, you have, of course, many Germans with a migration background, women, and also homosexuals (and I do not mean the over-the-top stereotypical gay men here, because there are relatively few of them in the executive branch; rather, I am referring to normal men and women who you would not notice if they did not tell you), and I have to be able to rely on these people in case of emergency, because, in case of doubt, they will save your life or put theirs on the line for you.
However, even these marginalised groups also represent a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel that they are not catered for by over-the-top left-wing policies, even though these policies are supposedly designed to help them, but they just want to be treated like normal people.
Go back to the rights, because of course the police and the armed forces are a cross-section of society, so you will also find extreme right-wing views there, but that they are allowed to openly express their views there, or even to hatch any plans that could endanger the state, is overblown in the media and annoys me.
Of course it happens that police officers and soldiers, who often work abroad, start to generalize and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It is also common for right-wing sympathisers to meet up and engage in lively discussion.
However, I believe that this will be dealt with well, and that education and enlightenment will counteract it!
Germany is so internationally entwined, and I think that's a good thing. We couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand it, but the other basket I ordered from the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not out of stock.
I ordered in November already.
However, it was confirmed in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer available.
I was chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, we could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany, or is this basket available somewhere in Germany?
I only find you as a partner company.
There are two deep grooves on the edge of the wooden part, which are filled with something yellow.
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
Is it normal for a child to do this?
Hi, I (w32) have been struggling with something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organised at work (I am self-employed and have very little free time), but I have always struggled to keep my home clean and organised on a permanent basis.
There are periods when nothing much gets done, and then sometimes I get carried away and clean and sort.
But it's never really "someone spontaneously dropped by".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it annoys me somewhere, but most of the time household chores just lose out against work and laziness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly, as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to be more organised with a child?
We don't have one yet, but we are working on it, and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because I don't really have an incentive to do it, and it doesn't really bother me that much, as long as nobody comes to visit and there's always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable, for example.
Does having a child give you more incentive, or does it make you more careless?
I look forward to hearing from you.
An exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and thus, practically unrestricted movement.
Pre-molding with special, further embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (in arm and knee bends)
On the Focea Comfort 4, with the Flex System 2, the area covered by the Flex System has been more than doubled to increase comfort even further.
Smooth stretch panels in the knees and elbows reduce friction (shoulders, arm and leg bends).
High-quality moldings in the lower back and seat area ensure a snug, perfect fit.
The Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility around the back zipper, improving comfort, especially when bent over or when donning and doffing equipment on the surface.
The free-flex zone around the shoulders and back ensures increased flexibility for moving the arms and body.
Fireskin is a warm, waterproof material with a specialised surface structure that provides high levels of cold protection.
Worn on the chest, it provides heat to a sensitive area of the body.
A seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal around the face at the helmet increases comfort, the seal and durability (separate headset)
The soft, inset zone improves the seal with a fine-adjustable strap that is flexible and gentle on the skin, and does not stick to the lining or seams

A career in social work – with a personality disorder?
I completed a course in software development and have been working as an apprentice for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am realising more and more that this is not the right job for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (i.e. fearful) personality disorder (FPD).
It means that I have low self-esteem and am shy as a result.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but I find it very hard to chat, and I've been told many times that I come across as aloof (which I think has improved slightly).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a youth worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family support.
But I don't know whether the actual working day is really like that as I imagine it, and it's hard to find information about it online.
The EVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it drags me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("again, the simplest things are fucked up"), and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding him back with my dumb questions"/"He must think I'm an idiot" etc.).
I'm probably going to have that problem in any job I do, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
There was no confirmation for that.
I am waiting for a pick-up date
What do you mean by give it back, please!
If I download a book from #PRS_ORG#, I get a message that says "Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorise this book"
Is there a problem here?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG, he asked if I had received my delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein (protein) taken in with the food is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids), which it then uses to build its own proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather development of the nestling and the feather regeneration of the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high load for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it may disrupt the breeding cycle.
Following this short course of NEKTON®-Bio, NEKTON®-S (multi-vitamin supplement) and NEKTON®-MSA (mineral supplement) should be re-introduced on a daily basis.

Only make as much water/soft food as the bird will consume in a day and change the water/food daily.
A dotted spoon (inset) equals 1 g of NEKTON Bio.
For severe feather damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio may be administered at the beginning, until the new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until the feather regeneration is completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
I'm sorry, but it's being sold as an executive chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
In Germany, the warranty period is 24 months.
That is really bad service.
Hi, I emailed you on Monday to let you know about my damaged order and to attach pictures.
Have you received this email?
A statement from a community worker in contravention of the constitution
Hi /r/LegaladviceGerman.
I have a problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So, an application for tree felling is made to the commune.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnuts, is not part of the statutes.
However, in the constitution, the walnut tree is specifically mentioned as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the statement made by the employee?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for that.
I didn't get any messages
Well, I still have a spare one then.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think so, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and get the duvet delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Emergency report: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord motorway junction and Plößberg.
According to the police press release (14:03), a passenger car came into the opposite direction while overtaking.
There are wounded.
Ah, okay, I get it.
Okay, thanks again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for the next stage of your career
Merry Christmas to you first!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is quite bad, because my dear brain is currently denoting everything that can be denoted.
Before I go off on a tangent...in short: I need advice, and preferably from people who know what it's like to be in my shoes - i.e. from you.
I am currently doing a refresher course as a mature student.
I originally studied something else and worked in that field (to remain somewhat anonymous, I will not say exactly what).
But then it got too boring for me and I started looking for alternatives that would be more fun.
At some point, I landed in the teaching profession, and I was sure that this was it – even though the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous job, but I didn’t care.
I’m now at the third “I’ll Google other job postings” stage.
And it's only been six months.
In the paintings before this one, I would always decide to keep going, and at least finish the piece, but then I could always change my mind.
But right now, I am completely overwhelmed.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely drained.
It's the holidays now, but there's still a pile of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress resistant, but it was my weekend and my weekend, and my off-duty time was my off-duty time.
I had the freedom to do that.
And the stresses of work didn't really matter in that moment.
Now, even the family celebration is too much for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that irritate me even more.
Basically, it's fun, and from the outside looking in, it's going well, in terms of the feedback we're getting.
But I am completely drained, and I wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I wonder if I want to do this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or whether I should go back to the old area where I was valued, had time when I needed it, and found the work boring but was paid for it, and worked as part of a team rather than as an individual, as seems to be the case most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I'm just going to be at the same place a year from now, and I'm going to be dissatisfied.
You see, it's all a bit muddled, but maybe you outsiders can give me advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, in which I am completely fed up and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make any decisions right now, emotionally. That probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least some light at the end of the tunnel – or to enjoy Christmas, which is good enough for now.
Thanks for reading, and sorry about the whiny tone.
I hope my situation is at least a little clearer now.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continued to evolve, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" control, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers are ready with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also feature the multi-stage Valvetronix preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits because they do a better job of reproducing the sound variations and subtleties of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated arrangement, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonance just bursts out.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even virtually correct and warp historic facts to get the amp and effects sounding exactly how you always dreamed of.
The perfect combination of tube-like sound with modeling technology is mainly credited to VOX Valve Reactor technology, which was first introduced in 2001.
Needless to say, it has been refined many times since then to accommodate new sound requirements, and in 2010 it led to a performance boost in the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and a host of new and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed to cater for all guitarists in search of a wide variety of sounds.
All guitarists dream of the compression and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a full sound, fine reproduction of dynamics and string attack, and a quick response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that it is mainly the output stage that determines the character of a valve amplifier, and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve rectifier circuit in every VT+ amplifier uses a 12AX7 tube, which perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite Wagner's 20 points: Magic lose against Clippers
Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven points by his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also highly adaptable: with three individually adjustable Velcro panels, it can be configured to suit any photography gear, from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes, to full-frame DSLRs.
What finally fits in the pack depends of course on the size of the camera and the lenses.
It could be equipped with a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three zoom lenses, and an external flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or the Fujifilm X-T2 still have room for additional lenses.
In addition, it can hold a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM (MFT from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your gear and non-photographic stuff.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also an ideal choice for drone pilots, as it provides sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano erupts on La Palma: the longest in history
In the three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows have caused great damage on the Canary island.
Is an end in sight?
The volcanic eruption on La Palma, which has lasted for a total of 85 days, is now the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary island.
Up until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, which lasted for 84 days, was considered to be the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous eruptions.
The activity of the still-unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has subsided somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists are still wary of predicting when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to state TV channel RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the three months since the start of the eruption, the lava, which is more than 1000 degrees hot, has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
This is equivalent to almost 1700 football pitches.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, with damage estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new peninsulas with an area of about 50 hectares were formed by lava that had cooled.
In particular, banana cultivation, which is crucial to the island's economy and the livelihoods of some 85,000 people, was already in a precarious state even before the volcano erupted, and has been hit hard.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper El País.
Christmas and gifts
Christmas is coming and children, in particular, can hardly wait.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension have a certain seductive quality.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still has the power to bring our increasingly polarised society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of gift-giving, so that the act of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a "peace treaty between savage tribes", can escape from the rigid routine and be revitalized in the context of this tradition.
From Nikolaus to Christkind
In strict terms, it was the Protestants who were responsible for associating the Christmas holiday with gift-giving.
In the past, gifts were exchanged on Nikolaustag.
The background behind this still-popular tradition is that Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to save them from prostitution.
This unconventional way of giving led to the German tradition of filling children's boots with gifts.
Protestants have objected to this practice, seeing it as "idolatry" or worship of "saints".
This is why they are resisting the institution.
Martin Luther made Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child, establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving therefore shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most protestants no longer take such details so seriously, it is only a small minority who take umbrage at the fact that the tradition of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, with the singing of carols and the St. Nicholas parade.
Today, you will find everything from boots by the door to under the Christmas tree, ranging from socks to luxury watches.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources date the tradition of gift-giving on St. Nicholas Day back to the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the giving of gifts was transferred to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a happy muddle about who is going to give the children the presents.
In Germany, it varies from region to region as to whether the Christkind or the Weihnachtsmann, who in essence is a kind of Santa Claus, appears on Christmas Eve.
These include his white beard, which has little in common with the more severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sledge, drawn by reindeer, and his preference for entering houses through the chimney.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings deliver the gifts, while in Italy, it is the Witch Beffana who points the way to the Baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, at times, fairies bring gifts, and in Russia, it was Father Frost who brought much fame.
Here it's not reindeer, but three horses pulling his sleigh.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near Buckingham Palace
A gunman has been shot dead near the Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said that callers reported a man armed with a weapon entering a bank and a bookmaker's office.
The man fled in a vehicle, which was stopped by officials a short time later, authorities said.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
Police did not suspect a terrorist background.
There are several embassies located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the Royal Family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
It stands on its own, and can be anchored to the ground with two spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar panel for optimum charging of the in-built battery.
Maximum duration of light: 10 hours.
- The robust plastic version is suitable for use outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood's spectacle, it is usually a threatening object from a distant galaxy that glows with inner colour.
On the other hand, Smart Stone is completely harmless: All it takes is the sun to make this solar light shine fascinatingly – either in white or colored light (in six different colors).
The edge-less, amorphous design was deliberately chosen: Like a large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves will fit into any natural environment – on the edge of a terrace, on the lawn or in a rockery.
It also does well in a neighbourhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where it holds its own due to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require a power supply or batteries.
Place the "Tellstone" at any sunny location you wish.
Two supplied spikes provide extra stability if needed.
The matte white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar panel discreetly hides a "Smart Stone" inside, along with his battery and two LEDs – one for white light, one for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the twilight, the "Smart Stone" starts to glow automatically; in which colour, that is up to you: You can choose from six attractive light colours – in addition to daylight white.
It also automatically disconnects once the battery level has been reduced to a predetermined minimum, or when it gets light again.
When the sun comes out, the cycle starts again the next day.
I've done that so many times and it didn't work.
Shame, I would have liked to have ordered from you again, but if the voucher isn't going to be credited then, by principle, I won't be ordering from you again.
Let me know if you change your mind.
Otherwise, it was the last contact today.
Could you please send me the number for the sideboard?

Pill problem
Hello, ladies.
I hope I'm doing this right; it's my first post after a year on Reddit.
My issue: I restarted taking the pill about five years ago, mainly because I was suffering so badly with debilitating period pains and PMS.
I would like to stay away from this now, because I have to take so many medications because of my chronic illnesses, and I can't choose them.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I went from zero to 100 with pimples, and they were everywhere during my last two-year break.
It was on the surface, but it weighed heavily on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
Over the course of the two-year break, things have never really normalised.
Somebody please tell me how to avoid this situation.
My cosmetics are already paraben-free and without any fuss, but maybe you can recommend something.
Unfortunately, the female doctor did not take me seriously, and the dermatologist appointment still to come.
Thank you to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, skin is such a thing.
She had severe neurodermatitis as a young child, then a period of remission, then widespread psoriasis and acne.
I have tried everything in terms of nutrition with a Christian illness. I have stuck with a sugar-free, dairy-free and meat-poor mixed diet, because nothing else has really worked.
It can also be the case that the hormones are simply playing up, but if you want to avoid looking for things that are going wrong elsewhere, then you'd better not look.
I had already done everything her colleague had done.
I wrote it, and now I've lost the conversation and I don't know what the answer was to my question.
I have to work during breaks and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details. Something must have been wrong
But is it generally available in large sizes?
since it is available in large size and black.

In the name of the people: lay judgments
They sit in casual clothes on the judge's bench in the courtroom.
Her verdict has a lot riding on it, even if she doesn't wear a robe: jurors decide with judges whether and how long someone will spend behind bars.

110-kV cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is now in force.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision paves the way for the construction, which is set to start in 2022.
This was announced by Bayernwerk, the network operator.
The approximately seven kilometre long underground cable will connect the substation Tann in the north of the community and the existing 110-kV line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast for overhead lines near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.2021 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part so far.
The blue BETSell number: #PRS_ORG# with the number #NUMBER# was sent back to #PRS_ORG# with the note "delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how it goes from here?
Good start into the week!
Forget it, I've already explained that a thousand times yesterday!
This is a glass cabinet that has burst open on all sides, so there is glass everywhere and the carton is broken.
The wardrobe is in my flat and #PRS_ORG# refuse to come in because of #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the wardrobe cannot be collected as no one is allowed in my flat
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is across all books, which is why the query has been sent to #PRS_ORG as it appears to be a general issue
Ref: Planning a lesson (EK)
Hello, colleagues.
I have been in the FSJ since the summer, I enjoy teaching, but I currently have a big problem planning my lessons in geography efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is technologically very poorly equipped, so I can only use the blackboard, textbooks, and an OHP as media.
In school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I just need a lot of time at the moment to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors and, in my case, every hour stands on its own.
Basically, the approach is always the same, but on the other hand, I don't want to spend too much time on simple lessons (I also have UBs, etc.).
I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (I usually create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra, and I am not satisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
That is why there are worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I'd be more than happy to do so.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would be happy to process the return as quickly as possible first.
The trade is worried about the Christmas business because of the 2G rule.
Only those who are vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 will be allowed into most businesses.
The trade considers it unnecessary and complains of loss of turnover.
He also has a possible solution ready.
In the view of the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G rules are ruining the important Christmas business for retailers.
Retail sales of non-daily-use goods are suffering losses, criticised HDE’s Managing Director, Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey of the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies are looking negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the high point of the year, is now often a hole in the ground," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost around a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the previous week alone.
The situation is only good in food retail and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with masks, distancing and hygiene measures is a safe thing to do, said the managing director.
‘2G in shopping centres will not get us any further in the fight against the pandemic’, he stressed.
The current rules have put off customers and required a lot of manpower.
He demanded that the belt rule be made compulsory across the country.
Afterwards, all customers would only have to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once, and they would be given a wristband that would give them access to all stores on that day.
In addition, in retail – as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) – it should be sufficient to carry out sample inspections.
Deutsche Euroshop, a property company specialising in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas trading period.
Frequencies were last at around 75% of pre-corona levels, with turnover at around 90%.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said Managing Director Wilhelm Wellner to Wirtschaftswoche.
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approvals.
This includes the so-called band solution, whereby "visitors have to present their 2G proof at one central location in the shopping centre, and then – equipped with a wristband similar to that used in a club hotel – they can enter all stores without hindrance". dpa
I recently ordered #PRS_ORG# and it was delivered.
The Spiegel has a scratch, and there is also a mistake in the frame, which was attempted to be covered up with yellow putty.
That doesn't look nice.
I would like to return the mirror, and I have already packed it back into the parcel and sealed it.
What should I do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor takes care of adjusting the colour temperature and brightness of the light.
In addition to adjusting brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and incandescent.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in Flash memory.
A particular feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
It produces a very strong beam of soft light, completely free of flicker.
The 120-degree spread of light makes it an excellent choice for illuminating large areas at a relatively close range.
In other words, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness almost without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to use on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the fixture in television studios or when the fixture is otherwise difficult to access.
The control panel is on the back of the torch, consisting of buttons and a lighted display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for NP-F batteries (not included).
User memory The memory has up to three user settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the options for each of the slots, just hold down the button for the desired amount of time and it's done.
The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very useful in studio work, e.g. if the camera is set to a particular colour temperature.
The use of batteries is one of the DL3120's greatest strengths, as the functionality stems from the ability to run on inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women).
The DL3120 can also check the batteries before the set is switched on – it has a battery tester built in – for each of the two battery compartments there is a value on the two display screens (the left battery has a value on the top screen, the right one on the bottom screen).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously power the headlight via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the searchlight is very simple.
It has a 16mm socket for attachment, so you can connect it directly to your photo tripod.
The tilt can be accurately set using adjustment screws on both sides.
Great care was taken to ensure that all mechanical components are of an extremely high quality, and are therefore designed for longevity and tough use.
Additionally, an angle wrench is included in the kit.
It also comes with a bag, which is great.
This way, you can easily transport or store the light fixture with all the accessories you may want to purchase.
Shame, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"The party we wanted to throw": After a thrilling comeback against Leverkusen, Frankfurt celebrates
What a spectacular reaction by Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the team from Hessen, who had lost twice in a row, appeared to be on their way to their next Bundesliga defeat.
However, then SGE turned things around, vented their frustration over a mediocre start to the season within a good hour, and won the game with a furious 5:2. "It is unbelievable what the boys have done today", Trainer Oliver Glasner jubilated on DAZN, and spoke a "general praise to everyone who was involved".
At first, it looked like another blow for the now in ninth place Frankfurt, which is still well behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2:0 lead.
What then happened impressed even the SGE trainer.
“How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance”, Glasner continued.
I am so happy with the performance we showed, and of course the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play for the first time since the fourth game and overcome his muscle injury, also stressed the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old, who was delighted for the spectators in particular.
That was the party we wanted to go to tonight.
However, Glasner wants to focus on the upcoming tasks now, and he feels well prepared in terms of the personnel situation.
It's exceptional that we have all our players available for selection in December, that all the players are in great physical shape.
It's top-class work in our medical department, but the players themselves live very professionally.
Now they want to "take it one step at a time and remain humble," and see the tasks through "at this level" until the end of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday, as part of the English week (7.30pm, Sky).
I just got an email that my package was returned to me because of an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG and redirect the call, no chance.
Can you resend it to me directly, or do I have to wait until the money has been refunded and then place the order again?
Unfortunately, this would mean that I would not order again, because it has already taken a long time.
Have you ever sat in the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
A setback for the women's handball team ahead of the quarter-final against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slink away from the court, heads bowed, eyes cast down after the humiliation of defeat against Denmark.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers, and now has to play against the host country, Spain, in the quarter-finals.
We were much too fearful and had too much respect for our opponents, said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to approach Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't bring that flow with us.
It was a bad game from all of us, which we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the race to qualify for the semi-finals, there has to be a significant improvement on Tuesday against the silver medallist from 2019 to keep the slim hope of winning the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was the back player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there – neither in attack, nor in defence", said Xenia Smits, a backcourt player, admitting: "We have to look ahead now".
Not up to scratch, front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the top of their game at the start of the match.
Mistakes and technical errors in attack and gaps in defence were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately ready for action and prevented things from getting any worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
However, this was not the hoped-for spark.
It was hard for the German women to set up against the aggressive defence of the Danish women – and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The match was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, early on, as the backcourt player Mia Zschocke received a red card for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter finals, however, she is allowed to play again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get better, and by half-time, at least, they had narrowed the gap to five goals.
The hope for a comeback after the substitution was gone after seven minutes with a score of 9:19.
Once again, Groener's protégés sinned in all areas, making it easy for the good-performing opponent, who is a medal contender in the finals.
As a result, the German team could no longer muster the strength to improve their performance, and they left the court as clear losers.

The title says it all: I work as a doctor in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in care homes.
Since they are almost finished, I will go to vaccination centres for part of it.
I am happy to answer questions without time limits to the organisational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I am taking medication X, is it compatible with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility falls the clarification for the vaccination, the indication (the person has a right to the vaccination according to the Covid-19 Vaccination Ordinance and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (happened to me for the first time).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have them, but only pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of the vaccine, who are not able to administer vaccinations (by God's will!), so that I perform the majority of vaccinations myself.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused quite a stir in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern" ("We in Bavaria").
However, unlike many previous days, the term was not guessed by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't "nervous guy".
And also none, "who has to get everything done quickly".
The people heard that the TV presenter was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg communicated as a solution, and which caused quite a stir among many in Upper Palatinate.
The announcer explained to the audience that ‘the Huidlerer’ is ‘someone who wipes down the oven with a cloth’.
Dialect expert Antony Rowley, who has been appearing on Bayern Fernsehen as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known colloquial word "Houdern".
With this, a gap in education was closed – probably also for many who have been living in Amberg for a long time.
I have been unable to buy books for two weeks now.
After confirmation, the following error message is displayed: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have rebooted #PRS_ORG# into #PRS_ORG# mode, reconnected the PC, synced and fixed.
Nothing helped.
Wheel choice for road cycling – is it really as safe as they say?
This morning, I woke up full of beans, determined to at least do some training for my cycle tour next week.
Say, do and I went for a bike ride on my new bike I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really nice – but then what you always find in every inner city (this time: thanks, Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, loud hissing, and my rear wheel definitely did not want to play ball for the rest of the race.
As I didn't have time during the week to get a new poncho and a new hose, I had to turn around and take the first available train home in a semi-bad mood.
It wasn't so bad after all, maybe it's better if I practice changing the wheel before the bike tour.
But now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
As I have a long way to go over several days, I would not want to encounter this problem too often.
It wasn't really bad now, because the old tyres from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had cycled 120km on them on the day I collected the bike, and had described them as suboptimal because he had been riding on them for several years!)
However, if I think about the fact that I still have to change a tyre after 80-90km, then I am really in a bad mood:
Now, I had a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; they are said to be impossible to puncture.
Needless to say, this all sounds very tempting.
But are they really as indestructible as they are made out to be?
I don't feel like paying 40 euros per tyre now, only to be disappointed in the end.
I also ask myself: I'm currently doing 25x622 on the track bike.
They do have them (apparently?), but most of them are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to go for a different type of tyre for a road bike?
Does the Swallow side seem to recommend the Durano DD more than my layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for your help, and best wishes!
Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old crashed his car into a central reservation on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for unknown reasons, and then drove onto the wrong side of the road, the police reported.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then thrown against a tree, pinning the man inside.
The 27-year-old driver and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured and taken to a nearby hospital.

After the publication of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series also received new members.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring, and it visually resembles the large predecessors with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design proposal includes a suitable foot directly, to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on acoustics and can therefore be adapted in length to suit the situation at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people who do not care about the maximum sound level, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels without filtering.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
In fact, it is maturing very well, and it stands very tall for its size, and it is very impressive.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight increase in high tones.
This is common practice for broadband transmitters to maximise throughput on the up-link, which becomes very concentrated at high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is precisely aimed at the listening position and impresses with a very clear and fine sound.
A slight tilt toward the outside of the speaker can reduce the high-frequency range, creating a warmer sound.
Thanks to the point source, it is now possible to pinpoint the individual components of a piece of music to within the optimal stereo triangle with stunning precision.
The reference-grade, extremely low mechanical loss of B 100 - 6 OHM provides a dynamic match that is hard to beat.
The SOLO 15 complements not only our SOLO series, but extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it pays to think about the finished look of the speaker at the planning stage, so that appropriate changes can be made during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer a speaker, you have to adjust the tilt of the speaker accordingly, because the veneer will add another layer of material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at a DIY store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the relevant point to be able to feed the cable through later without any problems.
With the help of a milling cutter, the speaker opening in the front is now created, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be fitted flush.
The back of this hole should be tapered at 45 degrees to maximize the opening area of the speaker chassis.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the image "Phase detail".
Then you begin construction on the box, and place one side on a flat surface.
Now the back, the cover, the front and the bottom are laminated onto it.
The three stays should also be inserted and glued in place.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in thickness according to need, e.g. if you want to use ready-made skirting boards from the DIY store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
The next step will be to attach the second side.
This is followed by all the plates on the sole, i.e. both sides and the front.
A suitable slot saw or Forstner bit will make it easy to drill the holes for the bass reflex port and the wall mounting clamp.
Next, a router is used to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded with this.
Next, the base plate is cemented firmly to the housing and additionally screwed in with long wooden screws.
Next, mark and drill (2.5mm drill) the fixing points of the speaker chassis and the connection clamp.
After the housing is cleaned of wood dust (vacuumed/blown), the cable can now be laid.
The easiest way to do this is with the 35 mm bass reflex opening on the back panel.
This involves pushing the entire, uncut cable through the 8 mm hole in the heel until it emerges at the terminus, about 30 cm long.
At the top of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and allowed to hang loose there as well.
Here the frequency changer is prepared and inserted.
The circuit diagram for the frequency changer, as well as the corresponding connection diagram, can be found in the following document: Installation Instructions for Frequency Changer Solo 15.
Is the frequency switch inserted and the connection terminal screwed? Then the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
With the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and a bit of skill, you can let hot glue on the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small torch, the sealing can be checked accordingly.
Now comes the cooling process, according to the description.
Next, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and clamped in place with the appropriate screws.
Polarity matters here, so the positive cable (marked wire) must be soldered to the positive speaker post (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube), and then inserted.
A mat of damping material is cut to size and distributed loosely inside the housing to suppress vibrations.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hi everyone,
We can finally announce that we will be holding the OSCAST again this year!
We are unfortunately unable to accommodate more than four people in the studio at any one time for a variety of reasons, which has meant more planning and explains the short notice.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the switch, so we will be able to watch the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 bubbles on stream, and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic; we're still going to do our best to make the Oscars as fun as possible.
It will start around 1:30 a.m.
Get some drinks cold, plan some good food, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
