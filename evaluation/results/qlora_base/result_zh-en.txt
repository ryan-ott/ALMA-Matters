Students sing the leading role at Zhejiang University Academic Conference, and the research results are mind-boggling - Xinhuanet
Using air to wash hands, sniffing to diagnose disease, and accurately searching for sources of haze. At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University last night, a series of academic achievements with creative ideas were awarded.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers the fields of environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life science, humanities education, and so on. Students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value. Some projects have won domestic and international awards.
Bio-sensors: Your home health-care doctor
Zhang Dingming, a doctoral student from the Biomedical Engineering College, demonstrated a bio-sensor on a smartphone at the site, which was only half the size of a smartphone.
“All you have to do is take a deep breath, and this device can detect your physical condition from the composition of the gas you exhale. ”
Zhang Di Ming said that this sensor is connected to the smart phone, and the health report will be displayed on the smart phone after exhaling gas.
Smart rings on the market can generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biological sensor uses a new type of material, graphene. Its target is a chemical element. Its keen "sense of smell" makes it possible to reflect the health status more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Light: Surgeon's High-powered Eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart surgical lights have also been used in the operating room.
This invention won silver at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
Zhulin Jing and Shen Junfei, master students of the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lamp and invented the smart LED surgical endoscope light.
"Many diseases are detected and removed inadequately, which is related to the light used in the operating room. "
Shen Junfei said that, for example, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in the early stage of cancer screening, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical light has four lamps, which can adjust the spectrum to enhance the differences of different tissues under light.
During the surgery, the surgeon can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and opacity of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits at any time.
This smart surgical light has been used in Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize of the National Invention Award.
Air wash: Water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by spraying water. At most, they rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, and so on. However, Li Qizheng and his classmates invented an "air washing device".
Just stepping onto the device's washbasin, our weight will squeeze the air out.
"It's like a balloon.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the nozzle which mixes with the water.
This way, our hands will be clean!”
The color-change reaction and bacteria-removal test proved that the effect of washing hands by this method was the same as that of ordinary washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force. It can not only ensure cleanliness, but also save up to 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy saving and environment friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among the world's top schools and won the only gold award.
Please arrange to return it to me as soon as possible, thank you.

Okay, thank you.
A certificate that I think is very meaningful - a first aid certificate
This is one of the skills I feel most confident about, aside from my driving license!
In layman's terms, emergency measures are actually emergency rescue measures, i.e. rescue before the arrival of the ambulance.
Needless to say, there is a period of time between the moment an ambulance is dispatched and it actually arrives on scene, and that is when the most good can be done.
This is when emergency care is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, brain haemorrhage, cardiac arrest, we only have four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So, it is so important for people around you to know first aid!
When someone falls down in front of us, we can try to save them with our professional knowledge instead of standing there like an idiot and doing nothing, which is too horrible.
"In China, we have official data of 300,000 people dying suddenly every year, and the leading cause is cardiac arrest.
In the United States of America, the survival rate is about 15%.
In a casino hotel in Las Vegas, 70-80% can be saved. In Shanghai and Beijing, it is less than 1%.
This was said by the founder of the first reaction, Lu Lv.
If someone has gone into cardiac arrest, they are not going to benefit from chest compressions if they are not breathing or their heart is not beating.
It is necessary to do artificial respiration and cardiopulmonary resuscitation to save people.
I found that we seldom have this awareness to learn CPR now. But it is too late when the thing happens. So I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can make timely response when we face emergency.
You never know who you might save!
The first-aid certificate can be enrolled in the Red Cross Training Center in your area. I enrolled in the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai. Students can also enjoy preferential treatment.
PS: The last picture was to record my goal before my 25th birthday. Adding emergency certification to the goal list was also a few months ago. However, I did it!
Next, I will go to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a scuba diving certificate. Previously, I saw a scuba diving emergency certificate on Little Red Book. It turns out that it is necessary to have an emergency certificate to take the scuba diving certificate. Therefore, the emergency certificate is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
13 yuan for shrimp dumplings?!
I haven't tried
How to make #NAME# clear?
One for 13?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# forgot to deliver the food. This time, just give me a shrimp dumpling!?
Because it worked before, when I entered the code.
In conclusion, in my opinion, "Four Sha" is a full-fledged bad movie in all respects.
However, you can't say that this film is a highlight. But at least the music selection is quite good.
There are many types of bad movies, and falling asleep in the movie theater is one type. Feeling outraged after watching is another type. “Four Sha” is like a monkey on Mount Emei. It can ignite your anger in many ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly a genius.
The most painful thing about the film is that it seems like a creation from a Kafkaesque novel, nameless and full of holes, just like the windbreaker worn by Qiao.
Even after watching it, you'll find yourself wondering if there was some sort of allegory the director was trying to get across, but then you realize it's just a pile of poo.
It is hard for me to understand some parts.
The protagonist lives on a small island in the south, relying on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, so the story was arranged that an uncle in the neighborhood drove her to the northeast to see the snow.
Are elderly people going to ride a bread truck from the south to the northeast to see snow?
He and his dad are very confident about it.
And then that was it for the old man.
How did the female lead's brother get a business license for a hotel on a wrecked ship?
Why is it so easy for the small hooligans on the island to block a section of mountain road?
Then, the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the side of the road, and the truck drivers around couldn't be found.
That is so obviously a prop.
Why would a small-time crook with bad credit and a criminal record become a traffic policeman?
Why not report high-interest loans to the police? The police in the film specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smart phone, but does not know how to open the door with the card in the hotel, and arranges to find the owner of the hotel forcibly, and sleeps on the door outside?
This surrealism permeates the entire film, to the point where I find it painful to even think about it.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about the film is its message, or lack thereof; it's a loathsome piece of stitchwork.
At the beginning of the film, you will think he wants to make a comedy film. After more than 20 minutes, you may think it is a motivational film. In the middle of the film, you may think it is a film about the difficulties of young people in small towns. After watching the film, you will find that you don't know what kind of film you have watched. Then, you will doubt yourself deeply. Why do you have to go to the cinema to appreciate a film about poop?
In fact, most people are quite familiar with the routine of most films. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle racer, then you need to add some motivation and comedy, and then tell the audience how an inexperienced genius achieves success step by step.
If you want to make a romance film, you should tell the story of the love and hatred between the young man who likes to ride a motorcycle in a small town and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, you can't have anything in your story that contradicts the real world.
(like the character played by Yin Zheng, who just got his new motorcycle burned, but is still capable of singing).
As for the female protagonist, who is obviously not mentally retarded but behaves like a 5-year-old in some aspects, I don't know whether it is because of her acting or the requirement of the director.
I also don't understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so obsessed with adding a crash scene in his own film?
Why is such a film scheduled for release during Spring Festival, is it to clog the audience’s pipes?

Chengdu Vocational Schools Pilot Modern Apprenticeship System - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that, from this year, our city will pilot the talent cultivation mode of "modern apprenticeship" in 60 technical secondary schools. The students who are accepted for pilot cultivation will have both apprentice and student identities at the same time, and will be pre-recorded as employees of pilot enterprises after enrollment.
The Municipal Education Commission required that the procedures of enrollment and employment of vocational schools be standardized, and that the dual identities of students in the vocational schools and apprentices of enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of mutual choice, the apprentices, the students in the vocational schools, and the enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement, and for apprentices who are 16 years old but have not reached 18 years of age, the apprentices, the guardians, the vocational schools, and the enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement to determine the rights and obligations of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and rights protection of apprentices on the job.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship system to jointly carry out pre-employment training and on-the-job training with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot schools should reform the mode of talent cultivation.
The school and enterprise jointly design the plan for talent training, jointly formulate the teaching standards, course standards, job standards, master standards, quality control standards and implementation plans.
The pilot aims to cultivate students for a period of one pilot cycle. The internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent cultivation plan. The on-the-job training generally lasts for 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise should implement the enterprise brigade management mode. According to the characteristics of different professions, one mentor can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can master the skills required by each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will determine 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with an average of 50 apprentices per pilot project, and a total of 3,000 apprentices (including apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of first piloting and then implementation, and gradually advancing from point to face, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated talent cultivation, and effectively improve students' position skills and improve the employment rate and quality of students.

South African doctors: Omicron is highly contagious, but most cases are mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of COVID-19 are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it is more contagious.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to symptoms of the flu.
The group's executive director, Unben Pillay, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none have required hospitalization.
Pile said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people can be cured after 10 to 14 days of isolation. "
He said this included the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions, who are more likely to end up in hospital with a coronavirus infection.
He said that in contrast to the previous Delta wave, his COVID-19 patients in this wave "were struggling to breathe, had low oxygen saturation."
Many people have to be hospitalized within days.
In the two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared a similar experience.
Although it will take weeks to gather enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of the new coronavirus patients in the hospital in the past few weeks were seriously ill, which was half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of new coronavirus patients died, which was 20% in the early epidemic in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, the director of African Health Research Institute, quoted the data of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: "At present, all signs indicate that it is a mild disease. "
He also said, "It's still early days and we need to get some more data."
Generally speaking, the time between hospitalization and death is late, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks. "
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching the case numbers and hospitalization rates, and testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the dominant variant worldwide, Omicron has been detected in dozens of countries, and South Africa is the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases detected in Ha Giang province increased by 400% in the first week of December. Tests showed that more than 90% of cases were the Omicron variant.
Thank you to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Opinion on education: How to save abducted children?
If we compare the famous public welfare slogan of "no killing without trading", then in the good environment where there is no "entrapment" demand, group prevention and treatment, and all-people anti-entrapment will make the trafficking activities unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not happen frequently.
Recently, the Child Abduction Emergency Publication Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was put online.
This is an authoritative channel for the publication of child abduction information, and an Internet information platform for timely recovery of abducted children.
This app is named "Together", which makes me feel very warm.
The new technological means not only have the names of "art" and "sentiment", but also are well-applied in informationization. They are practical and effective.
The primary objective of abduction law enforcement is to recover the abducted children and ensure their safety and freedom.
Second, the trial and punishment of the suspects.
There are many "big words" for the significance of criminal punishment, including individual punishment, social prevention, and legal education.
However, the safety of the victim should be given priority before the breakthrough of the trafficking case.
The importance of the matter and the urgency of “seeking rescue” underlie the controversial and ambiguous topics such as “whether kidnapping should be subject to the death penalty”, which can be put aside for the time being and discussed cautiously; however, the rescue of kidnapped children cannot wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, the traffickers are accustomed to leaving the scene as soon as they get their hands on the victims.
For every minute the search and rescue operation is delayed, the child will move further away from the parents, making it more difficult to solve the case.
In this situation, it is practical to take direct and effective measures such as the "Tracing Lost Children" platform to help solve the case and find the children.
After all, "rescue" is a huge task that requires the whole judicial system to work well.
We must uphold the rights and interests of children and parents, improve legislation, safeguard justice, and enforce the law with the care of "nurture and tenderness".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be improved from the family to the society.
For example, a common case is when a family of three is resting at the train station, the parents sleeping, and they only discover the child is missing after they wake up.
You can't expect a two-year-old to have enough self-preservation skills, but as the parent of a young child, you should at least have enough awareness to protect them.
Both parents resting and/or keeping the child in a safe environment are the least we can do to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police crackdown on child trafficking, the buyer of kidnapped children should also be paid attention and punished.
One act of misconduct is just one link in a long chain.
According to China’s Criminal Law, the minimum punishment for trafficking in children is 5 years, and if the circumstances are particularly severe, the death penalty will be imposed and the property will be confiscated.
The starting point of sentencing is high, and the maximum punishment is severe. Under the general trend of "light sentencing", the trafficking of children is obviously a punishable offence.
However, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people are backward in the idea of raising children and have a weak legal awareness.
The legal education of this group of people should keep pace.
In order to effectively control the trafficking crime, it cannot only rely on the strict law enforcement by the official.
If the "market" of kidnapping for ransom is widespread, the kidnappers will be greedy for money and constantly invent new means of kidnapping. This will inevitably lead to a "cat-and-mouse game" between the law enforcement officers and the kidnappers. The anti-kidnapping operation will inevitably fall into a low-efficiency quagmire.
Therefore, overcoming backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge will also help to eradicate child trafficking and kidnapping crimes.

In fact, we don’t know whether it was the shop’s mistake or the courier’s mistake
No receipt in the bag
It can't be traced.
Hopefully, this will make sense to you.
It was delayed by 30 minutes from when it was supposed to arrive.
No, thank you.
Yes, we have changed the rider.
He's been waiting a long time.
The restaurant was always saying that they were in the process of dealing with it.
A few hours later.
The International Olive Council classifies olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, with five grades.
Pure olive oil, also known as extra virgin olive oil, is obtained directly from freshly harvested olives by mechanical cold pressing, followed by filtering to remove any impurities.
There are three grades depending on the acidity:
Extra-virgin olive oil: It is the highest grade and the highest quality of olive oil, and it is a pure natural product.
It has a wonderful flavor with a delicate floral aroma, and its acidity is less than 1%.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVO): slightly more acidic, but no more than 2%, pure, fruity flavor.
Pure Extra Virgin Olive Oil (PEVO): Flavorful and delicious, with acidity below 3.3%.
Pure olive oil refers to refined olive oil obtained from extra virgin olive oil with acidity above 3.3%, or “second oil”.
Refined olive oil can be of two grades:
Pure olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain amount of extra virgin olive oil to blend flavor and color. The acidity is below 1.5%, and it is transparent with a pale golden color.
Refined Olive Pomace Oil: It is obtained by extraction and refining from the solid waste of olive oil production.
Anyone who has studied the hierarchy will know that olive oil acidity is a very important indicator.
In other words, olives are like grapes when it comes to making wine. Olives from different regions and different varieties of olives will produce olive oil of different standards.
The best place to grow olive trees:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil, temperature, sunlight, air humidity and precipitation for the growth of olive trees.
Outside of the Mediterranean, it can only be found in scattered populations in their native range.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, are similar to our climate, and so are Argentina, Peru, and South Africa, which are far south of the Equator.
Olive harvesting month:
Between June and September, the oil palm flowers and bears fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to ripen and mature, changing from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the fruiting season (freshness of olive oil is very important).
Olive oil nutritional composition:
Olive oil contains a rich variety of monounsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the healthiest oil discovered to date.
Democratic convention comes to a close, with Biden declaring the flame of democracy will never go out
The online "Summit for Democracy", which was hosted by US President Biden and attended by leaders from government, civil society, and the private sector from 110 countries worldwide, concluded on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of democracy is burning in the hearts of every person in the world, and that the autocratic regime will never be able to extinguish it.
He also expressed that the second Global "Democracy Summit" will be held next year.
Tang Fang, the representative of the Taiwan government and the secretary, and Lo Kin Chung, the overseas activist of Hong Kong democracy and human rights, also spoke on the second day of the summit.
Biden said, "We know how big the job is in front of us.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
The totalitarian regime can never extinguish the small fire of freedom. It is burning in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world. "
Biden also said that safeguarding democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said, "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reforms, and achieve the transparency of accountability management. We can better resist the buffer and impact of despotism, as well as those who seek power at the expense of the public interest. "
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Forum" were human rights, consolidation of democracy and resistance to authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy.
This day coincides with the "International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination".
In his opening speech on the same day, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Guterres also said that democracy is facing challenges worldwide, especially the challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "It is time to reaffirm the shared values and positions, and the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, localism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, Alan Liang, delivered his speech via pre-recorded video to the conference, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities such as the Uighur and Tibetan people in China.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been subjected to China's rise, but there is no mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must make full use of everything we have (resources) to ensure that democratic revival is our top priority. "
Roger Yan also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
He said, "Some of you may be afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, some of you may not want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you may not have realized (the threat of the CPC) to our democratic values.
That was our problem.
This is also the reason we must change. "
Tang Fang, Executive Secretary of the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China, delivered the "National Declaration" via video at the round-table discussion on "Fighting Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values", stressing that Taiwan was standing at the forefront of fighting against autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experiences on how transparency and building trust can help fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
He said, "We have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism at a time when democracy in Taiwan is on the rise. We have also played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights.
In times of pandemic, authoritarian regimes across the world have justified violations of human rights under the pretext of public health and collective well-being, and democracy has regressed globally.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without lockdown and defeat false information without banning. "
At the same time as the schedule of the "Democracy Forum" was being carried out, the US Treasury announced that 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries that had been determined to have seriously violated human rights would be lawfully sanctioned, and that investment restrictions would be imposed on a Chinese company that had been determined to have used surveillance technology to assist in the violation of human rights.
I already took a picture and uploaded it to you
I know.
But the restaurant didn't know why the delivery time was delayed over and over again.
It was supposed to be #NUMBER#
So, I didn't call.
eat
I will lodge a complaint.
You can't deliver it, so why don't you say it sooner
I waited for you for so long.
No, I didn't get a call
Please notify him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore
One hour and a half wait for a meal
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered.
I would like to cancel the order.
Why not cancel?
As for the chicken delivered by the restaurant, it was still alive
I would like to give tennis a try, but I am afraid that I will not be able to stick with it, so I would like to find a coach with a similar price.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If it can't be distinguished, the expensive will be more friendly than the inexpensive one. This kind of "entry level" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very weak, and when the ball hits the racket, it vibrates a lot. It is hard to control the hard ball.
The logic and subtext are that - it's so hard to play tennis; you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to spend a lot, so we'll give you something cheap and nasty and you won't want to play again. It's a win-win situation.
When you can tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Then, come back here and buy the expensive stuff, and I will make twice as much money.
It is suggested to pay a similar price to buy a better second-hand racket. Choose between Prince and Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known, so the good racket cannot be sold at a high price. A new racket with a price of 500 or 600 is good enough. A second-hand racket with a price of 200 is not bad, is it?
It is friendly to beginners, but it is useless after the beginner stage. However, most people, especially girls, can not pass the beginner stage.
Orders have been delayed multiple times
Can you help us follow up, please?
postpone
Thank you.
So, in a way, I've already got a credit?
Next, do I need to re-order? Was my previous order cancelled?
Hello, I ordered the food from this restaurant, but there were a lot of things missing and the chicken was raw
#PRS_ORG# You can't make unreasonable demands on my time and then say you didn't mean it. Please cancel.
My order was for delivery, and there was no need to pick it up.

In fact, there are many things to pay attention to when dressing for petite girls.
A fat girl's skirt can't be too short or too long. It should be around the knee, covering the fat on the thighs.
A short skirt will emphasize the fat on your legs.
Long hair will make you look shorter and fatter.
If the skirt is divided into three sections, it will make you look taller. You can use different colors for the top, skirt and long socks to create a graceful look.
In fact, many dark-colored garments are staples for plus-sized women (something the author can attest to). Dark colors are also a good way to hide a larger figure, and short black dresses are the first choice for plus-sized women.
Wearing dark colours, especially black, makes you look slimmer.
If your calves are on the chunky side, keep socks and shoes to a minimum.
The more popular it is, the better. And the color shouldn’t be too flashy.
So that people don't stare at your legs or feet and make you look fat.
Girls who are slightly chubby should be told that it is important to know how to match clothes.
Chubby girls should never wear tight mini skirts. In addition, the top should not be too short or stuffed into the skirt, which will make people feel uncomfortable. If you have fat legs, you should wear black long socks or net socks (the kind with small holes, please). Choose a floral ruffle skirt with soft texture to match a V-neck sweater, which can cover the shortcomings of chubby girls.
Of course, there are rules for plus-size girls wearing mini-skirts.
If you're a pear-shaped girl with short skirts, you should choose a top that is the same color as the skirt to make you look taller.
A short skirt paired with high heels can make your legs look longer. This is the hottest match of the summer!
If you are a fat girl with thin legs, it is recommended to choose a stylish short skirt.
It can cover a large belly and show your advantages.
The A-shaped skirt will make you look slimmer. It is more suitable for fat girls. Choose a tighter shirt to create a layering effect, which will make you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt, plus size girls can also give it a try.
A chubby girl can also be stylish.
If you can master the rules of dressing, then overweight girls will also be the focus of attention.
After changing the dressing and matching, we should exercise more in daily life. Let's try to get rid of the label of chubby girl as soon as possible😄

Girl is target practice for sister to raise money for her - Xinhuanet
At the Wulin Square in Hangzhou, a girl stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human target, 10 yuan per shot".
A photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be a target to raise money for her sister" went viral in WeChat Moments yesterday morning.
The photo shows that a girl stood in front of a high wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The wooden board was inscribed with the words "human target, 10 yuan per shot", indicating that people could shoot arrows after paying money.
This behavior triggered heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the spokesman of Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau Xiacheng Bureau confirmed to the reporter of Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl was her sister and made such violent actions. However, this behavior was not worthy of affirmation. After being advised, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl who was "pigeonholed" on street for fundraising receives warning
In the pictures circulating online, a long-haired girl stood in the shape of the character “个” in front of a large wooden board, on which the words “human target, 10 yuan per shot” were written in black ink, and there was another wooden board in front of her with her bank account number and WeChat, Alipay and other account numbers.
The image triggered controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believed that this was a "begging act to attract eyeballs", and there were many netizens who expressed sympathy.
“We found the situation around 10 o’clock in the morning of the 23rd when we patrolled to the square. There were many spectators at that time. "
The policemen of Tianshui Police Station, who were interviewed by local media, said that there were two girls in the stall, both of whom were aged around 20 and dressed in a youthful manner.
In the video, a girl who was forced to be a "human target" was crying and asking passers-by to play a game; another girl was helping to shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and now urgently needed surgery and asked for help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was fundraising for her sister’s leukemia treatment.
Last night, the publicity head of Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau Xiacheng Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl’s name was Ji Jia Li, and she was collecting donations for her sister Ji Jia Yan.
However, due to the treatment cost of more than 300,000 yuan, there was no good way to raise funds at that time, so we made this kind of behavior.
He said that during the process, one girl was used as a target, and the other was used to shoot. However, during the process, no one shot arrows, but only took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
After police identification, the bow and arrow used did not fall under the control category.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate this kind of fund-raising."
She has left the police station after being warned by the policeman on duty.

What was the hottest thing in 2021?
It was definitely the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympians can win?
There was an article with the title of “Look! The Olympic event that project managers can win gold medals”. It was very popular. The article mentioned that project managers can take the lead in many projects. No one can beat them: bricklaying, traveling, staying up late are the daily routine of project managers. Firefighting, shifting blame, and making apologies are not uncommon.
This article, which seems to be a joke, actually reflects the daily hardships of project managers. It represents the helplessness of current project management work.
Those in project management are also gradually choosing to take action to get out of work dilemmas.
From the number of PMP (Project Management Professional) candidates who register every year, it can be seen that more and more project managers improve their project management ability by learning.
According to the "20-Year Development Report of China's Project Management (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants in China was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified was approximately 420,000, and the number of valid certificates was approximately 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® certificate holders.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified people has been increasing year by year. This shows that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer possible to rely on past "old experience" to do things. The ever-changing work environment makes us know that we must learn to explore the way forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
But does passing the PMP exam guarantee that project management will go smoothly?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other relevant courses, they can systematically master the ten areas and five processes of project management, but still feel confused when they actually work on a project.
Many project managers often report the following issues: a lack of project management knowledge, relying solely on personal experience, having a project management theory but not knowing how to put it into practice; a lack of systematic project management process support, work cannot be implemented on the ground, project estimation is inaccurate, sensitivity to control is poor, and the project drags on and on; members are not clear about their responsibilities, and the “old hands” in the team do not know how to deal with it; cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to move forward ...
Therefore, it has been focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than 10 years, and has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key talents. It has also won the honorary title of “China’s Talent Training Base for R&D Management”. China Ventus Consulting, which has been focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than 10 years, has brought an online course of “R&D Project Manager Training Camp”.
The online course of “Development Project Manager Training Camp” is a kind of online learning method of fragmented learning. It combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many development enterprises. It helps you to master the knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and take the next step of personal project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the process of cultivation of project managers at a lower cost and with less investment, and bring about high-efficiency operation results for enterprises.
This course is based on the opinions of other students: This course is not only based on the expert team of Zhong Tian Huaxia (the original Huawei R&D management team), but also combines the advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms to help students to convert and apply what they have learned after class to specific work.

The abundant and eye-catching cash-back coupons, as well as the attention-grabbing live broadcast shopping have once again brought benefits to consumers. This trend of consumption has made people exclaim that the national consumption power has become increasingly strong on the one hand, and on the other hand, it has forced people to reflect on the influence of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of “Double 12”, Jiuxin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Jiuxin”) issued a call for rational consumption, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and habit, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the result of "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, which was 2.04 higher than that in 2019.
In general, the performance of Chinese residents in financial consumption is good, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, so it is necessary to further improve the basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy of the elderly and young people is relatively low. "The elderly and the young" will continue to be the focus of financial education. The "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV-2 show that the young generation has a huge consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important means of consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people use credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation. Although the young generation as a whole shows a trend of rational consumption, it is quite different from the label of "over-spending" given by the outside world, but some young people do have over-consumption and follow-up consumption behavior, and as a result, they have a huge financial pressure and debt risk, and even cause social problems to gradually increase. Financial institutions should be brave to assume social responsibility and make positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiuxin has always been committed to helping the people build their own happy life by providing high-quality and caring services. It advocates that consumers should establish a good and correct consumption attitude, and actively respond to the call of supervision by taking practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people.
In the past years, Jiuxin has carried out a comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including university students, and launched various forms such as innovative practice competitions in collaboration with top domestic institutions to gradually guide the consumption demands of young people, help them establish a rational consumption concept, plan their consumption demands rationally, and thus help them accumulate wealth throughout their life.
On the occasion of Double 12, Jiexin reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption concept and a correct money concept, resist blind consumption and over consumption, avoid the trap of consumption borrowing, so as to avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
Plan your spending in advance, and pay your bills on time.
If it is overdue, the record of overdue will be recorded in the personal credit report, and it may have a bad influence on the economy in the future, such as buying a car and buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to whether the relevant institutions have operating qualifications.
In the future, Jiuxin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products to provide consumers with services that are more in line with their needs and diversified. Jiuxin will continue to help the general public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers develop a rational consumption habit and a moderate borrowing concept, and be a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on throughout their lives.

Vietnamese People's Newspaper - Gulf Cooperation Council to Cope with Common Challenges
The stopover of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first time that Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a ban on Qatar in the middle of 2017, which led to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, imposed a complete embargo, and accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the SCO and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved in January 2021 at a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit, where the countries of the Gulf signed an agreement, brokered by the United States and Kuwait, to move towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
The resolution of disputes among Arab countries in the Gulf to restore relations with Qatar stems from the need to unite for the interests and stability of all countries in the region in the face of common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land corridor between two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-km long corridor, which connects the two countries, will facilitate the travel and integration of the citizens of the two countries.
Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and 13 memorandums of understanding with a value of $30 billion were signed between the two countries.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with Iran's negotiations with the world's major countries on the Iran Nuclear Deal - a deal that the Gulf Arab countries blamed for not being able to solve the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "rival" and regarded Iran's nuclear plan as a "threat" to regional security.
All the Gulf countries believe that the failure to resolve the Iranian missile issue and to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region is unsatisfactory.
Against the backdrop that the nuclear talks between major countries and Iran have failed to meet the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct talks.
It was aimed at de-escalating the tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that will contribute to the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming HRC summit will be the first summit of HRC member countries since the dispute with some member countries and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements that contribute to the restoration of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and put forward a series of measures to make its member states fully cooperate to face common challenges, and make contributions to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

The roar of the supercar in New Subang is said to be the loudest!
This time, our team brought this car to everyone. It is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, and the successor of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
It costs nearly RM200,000 in ringgit, and RM15,000 in road tax per year. It is a four-wheel drive vehicle, so why is it called the LP700?
With 700 horsepower, how fast do you think it is?
I don't know either. According to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. In other words, by the time myVi reaches 30km/h, the other party has already reached 100km/h.
The short wheelbase, the aggressive scissor doors, the large air intakes all over the body, and the 6.5L V12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to explain the car model in detail. You can just Google it. The editor has summarized some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention and everyone is staring at you wherever you go, which is uncomfortable (in a good way)!
1km oil cost around RM1 (car owners don't care at all)
Practice getting on and off, as it is a little embarrassing (especially if you get stuck with one foot in the door and can't get the other foot in)
The engine noise is so loud that you go deaf as soon as you step out of the car (but it's still fun).
The body of the car is too big, and it is very narrow to park in a normal parking lot. I am afraid to be knocked by the car next to me when opening the door!
Lonely, because there is no competition on the road (This is what the driver said, but it has nothing to do with the driver, haha)
Please don't misunderstand, the supercar in the video isn't for sale, I'm sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your car, feel free to contact us!
More car information that you don't know can be found on The Car Guide / People's Car
It's a million dollar crash!
The Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. The Chiron is one of the world's most expensive supercars, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the million-dollar range!
The day before, foreigners knocked over a million supercars, such as the 911 and the Chiron in just a few minutes!
Look at the result, you are right!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of academic concepts and values accumulated by a university over a long period of time. It is the soul of a university.
Since ancient times, the spirit of universities has been closely related to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the first modern university in the world, the university has borne a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For Chinese universities, it was born in the autumn of national crisis. Its spirit has been deeply influenced by the traditional culture and the changes of time. It advocates the value concept of “cultivating virtue and benefiting the world”, and the patriotic responsibility of “strengthening the country through education”.
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly apparent. The global competition in education, science and technology, and talent competition is intensifying. As an important "supply side" of education, the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the "General Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines" has not only demonstrated China's confidence and determination to advance from a higher education power to a higher education power, but has also raised higher requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to be in the forefront of the world in a short time on the basis of still having a certain gap, accelerate the establishment of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines, and achieve “overtaking in the curve”?
In addition to having a firm goal, path and ability confidence, universities should give full play to three advantages: first, the advantage of being a late starter, by continuously introducing overseas academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and achieving a significant improvement in academic level and the quality of administration; second, the advantage of culture, inheriting the wisdom accumulated over the course of 5,000 years of Chinese civilization, and promoting the development of excellent traditional Chinese culture, thereby mobilizing power, shaping the brand, and raising the image; and third, the advantage of the system, taking advantage of the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening the goal-oriented drive, gathering consensus, optimizing the resource allocation, providing a solid and sustainable guarantee for the university to catch up with the world’s advanced level at an accelerated pace.
It is particularly important to be aware that it is impossible for a world-class university to be exactly the same as other universities. All universities must make the most of their strengths while highlighting their individuality and characteristics.
The educational characteristics should have the common characteristics of China, and also reflect the unique objectives, educational traditions, and endowment of resources.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we attach importance to highlighting three aspects in our management: one is to highlight the distinctive features of talent training for innovation and entrepreneurship; we have built an integrated environment for education and industry integration, and formed an entrepreneurship education ecosystem along the whole chain; two is to highlight the distinctive features of interdisciplinary gathering; we have promoted the optimization and adjustment of disciplinary system, created an institutional environment for interdisciplinary, and actively cultivated emerging interdisciplinary and landmark achievements; and three is to highlight the distinctive features of the management system and social services. We have carried out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and have accelerated the formation of a comprehensive Zhejiang University-industry-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to adhere to the spirit of the university and make the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of “Seeking the truth and pursuing innovation”, the shared values of “hard work, virtue, discernment, and perseverance”, and the motto of “embracing the rivers and lakes, opening up the minds of the people, and building a prosperous country” constitute the latest expression system of the Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct educational direction and continue to accumulate cultural height and cohesion. It is rich in content and has a profound and long-term significance.
Among them, "Hainanjianghe" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, and reflects the attitude of "using all talents in the world"; "Qianzhende", emphasizes the pursuit of truth and virtue, and refers to the cultivation and tempering of morality and personality; "Kaiwumin", reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, and includes the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific and technological innovation, as well as reform and development; and "Shuimaofengguo", emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and means that the university should always be at the same height as the motherland.
This series of spiritual ideas and values is the soul of Zhejiang University’s 120 years of education.
The wise man listens attentively in a silent manner, and the virtuous sees the unseen.
Chinese universities should further focus on the overall situation of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, deeply understand the time position and historical missions of higher education, and speed up the building of world-class universities.
At the same time, we should uphold the humanistic care and independence, and let the university spirit, the spirit of the times, and the spirit of the nation resonate with each other, so as to provide an endless power for realizing the prosperity of the country and rejuvenation of the nation, and for realizing the common ideal of humanity.

In the midst of NFT mania, the cryptocurrency community has come up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" made a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic started to get a stable income from this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology. It combines a variety of gameplay, including NFT, and is currently the project with the highest trading volume. It has exceeded US$3 billion.
Token Terminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeds US$8.2 million, approaching Tencent's "王者荣耀".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity official claimed that its daily active users had exceeded 100,000.
The heat of “Axie Infinity” will spread a new “play-to-earn” model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role. In addition to obtaining fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This kind of sovereignty is not granted by the game developer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
I was most impressed by the news about my friend's stock price. My biggest feeling was the choice of the enterprise on the track, also known as the choice of the investment target industry. First, it should choose an industry with a large growth space of at least 100 billion yuan; second, it should choose an industry with a good future growth; and third, it should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the race track refers to the size of the market, the length of the race track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the race track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Go for the right track!
To start the new year, we should summarize the 2021 and adjust the 2022 strategy.
The strategy is to "do all the right things", which means doing things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to say, to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the tactic is to implement it. There is a lot of space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (strategic thinking) can be considered in terms of whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, how to improve customer retention (strategic thinking) can be considered in terms of how to improve the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); for example, how to increase the participation rate (tactical thinking) can be considered in terms of how to set up the correct KPIs, achieve the correct goals, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and precision recruitment; for example, how to increase DAU (tactical thinking) can be considered in terms of whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born for 12 years, Bitcoin ushered in several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small Central American country, made Bitcoin a legal currency. This is the first time that Bitcoin has become a legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the first time approved the ProShares company to launch a Bitcoin ETF, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange. This marks the first regulated Bitcoin futures ETF in the United States, and the expansion of the cryptocurrency investment gap once again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft split upgrade called “Taproot”, which enhanced the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions, and reduced the data load of transactions by changing the data structure of blocks.

The quality of the wedding photo is really good, just as online said, my husband and I are very handsome and beautiful, we are very satisfied.
The sellers are also very friendly.
This trip not only enjoyed the beautiful scenery, but also took beautiful wedding photos, and met a good friend, the photographer.
The wedding photo is too good-looking. I would like to blow up the photographer and makeup artist. You are really super super professional.
Thank you, Ms. Miao, for your patience in accompanying and teaching me. I like the photos taken.
In that moment, I didn't recognise myself in the wedding photos.
With the right photographer, you too can have a wedding photo that rivals that of a celebrity.
The most important thing about taking wedding photos is that the photographer and the makeup artist are aesthetically on the same line. Fortunately, I met one.

Asian American group complains that Yale and other Ivy League schools discriminate against applicants - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Washington, D.C., May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 ethnic groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - for discriminating against Asian applicants during the recruitment process.
The Asian Pacific Islander Education Network, which spearheaded the complaint, held a news conference in Washington that day.
Zhao Yuchao, the chairman of the group, said at the conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of US top universities has grown exponentially, but the proportion of Asians in these three US top universities has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have "sustained and systematic discrimination against Asian American applicants" in the so-called "holistic review" admission process.
Zhao Yuzuo said that in 2014, the research of Sandes and other scholars showed that in these three universities, the admission rate of Asian students was the lowest among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Wellesley College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and that Yale University and Brown University have imposed de facto racial quotas on Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuzuo told the Xinhua News Agency reporter that they hoped that the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice would investigate after the complaint was submitted, and that they would take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in their recruitment.
They also hope that the universities they complain about will proactively address the issue and change their admissions policies for Asian-American students.
The three universities that have been complained about have yet to respond.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, and at that time, it complained against Harvard University’s discrimination in recruitment. However, the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups, the complaint was filed by the American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American education groups.
Utensils needed
Just canceled
Why it's still being enforced
Can you check to see if it has been cancelled?
But I ordered at 5:09 a.m.
They have no clue what is going on over there
Is there a direct phone number I can call?
In September 2020, Mr. Li learned from a real estate agency that a factory in Zhuangtian Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang was available for sale. After several site visits, Mr. Li decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Liu paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan to the bank account of the owner of the house after negotiation with the family members of the owner of the factory on the details of the purchase of the factory.
Lin signed the “Deposit Slip for Factory Purchase” as the payee, which stated, “If the buyer does not want to purchase this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and the buyer and seller will sign a factory purchase and sale contract within a week.”
However, the two parties failed to reach a consensus on major contract terms, such as the scope of sale of the factory and payment method, and the house purchase contract was delayed for a long time.
Considering that the parties failed to reach a consensus on the terms of the contract, a few days later, Lin X returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Liu X.
Liu said that he was helpless and angry that he had paid a deposit and was ready to pay the down payment for a house that he had finally found, only to find that the seller had pulled out at the last minute.
Mr Liu sued Lin to Yuyo People’s Court.
The court found that after the trial, the parties failed to sign a formal contract, and the defendant could not solely blame the defendant. It was reasonable to presume that the negotiation failed. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty of deposit. The defendant did not need to bear the breach of contract liability of double repayment of deposit.
After the first-instance verdict, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
The second court upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyers warn] that due diligence is required in the course of the transaction.
As a buyer, it is necessary to perform the necessary due diligence when signing a contract, such as verifying the information of the house owner, whether the house is occupied by others, and stipulating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
On Saturday (December 11), the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said in a speech that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" after the end of the "Democracy Summit" on Friday (December 10). The United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw an ideological line, tool and weaponize democracy, use the name of democracy to do the opposite of democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic conflicts".
The Chinese government believes that "in the long run, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, carried out "democratic reform", imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated the "color revolution", and brought disastrous consequences.
Already, "democracy" has become a "weapon of mass destruction" for U.S. intervention in other countries.
This summit was a step by Mr. Biden to follow through on his campaign promises.
The two-day conference was held via video link, and was attended by leaders from 111 countries, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States had no right to host such a summit.
Internationally and in the United States, there are also doubts. For example, there are criticisms that include some leaders with authoritarian and autocratic inclinations, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who suspect that the true intention of the Biden administration is not to promote democracy, but to organize the summit for geopolitical reasons.
German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit
The statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy has shown its sickness. The problems of money politics, identity politics, party polarization, political polarization, social division, racial conflict, and wealth and income disparity have become more and more serious." The democracy of the United States is built on the basis of capital and is a "game of rich people".
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, and achieve transparent governance. This will be more resistant to the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who seek power at the expense of the public interest.
He stressed that democracy is not a matter of course. "We must update it in every generation. In my opinion, this is a decisive challenge in this era. "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "face continued and worrying challenges, and democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The U.S. has pledged a year-long effort that includes a $424.4 million commitment to bolster democracy around the world and support independent media.
The U.S. hopes that all countries will make specific, public commitments before the planned democracy summit at the end of 2022 to improve their democratic systems.
Biden said, "Let's get all countries to implement our commitments and report the progress we've made next year."
Yes, I'm afraid he sent it to the wrong address.

Delicious, meaty, and with great service
It has been a long time since I came to Dayuan. The drink of Fruit Picking is still as good as before. I ordered a steamed bun for the first time. It is the southern taste of the soft glutinous rice flour that I love!
The wonton noodle is just right in terms of both dryness and moistness, and the portion is very generous. The signature steamed chicken wings are as good as ever, and the soup is also not bad. The ginger treatment of the wonton noodles is also better than before...
Delicious, attentive service, and good meats
The old shop in Ji Chang has been a net sensation for a long time. Dong Tiang Lou, wooden floor.
It took forever to get a bowl of wanton noodles at the door. The bowl of wanton noodles cracked ...
I have not been to Ji Chang for several years. The rise of various small stores of Guangdong cuisine has dispersed the flow of customers.
Rare to find a restaurant with seats available on the spot. The quality of food is as good as ever.
The flavor is good, the meat is good, and the staple food is good
Takeout from Ji Chang.
[Rice] Food: A bit disappointing this time.

What is the whisky cocktail called Red Card?
Everyone has their own preferences. Some like to collect, some like to eat, and of course, some like to drink. Red Wine Whisky is one of the most popular Scotch Whiskies in many countries. It has also won a gold medal at the International Spirits Challenge.
Each bottle of red whisky has its own unique flavour, but if you don't know how to taste it, you're just wasting its sweetness.
So, how do you drink red whiskey?
Here is a brief introduction.
Drinking whisky on the rocks:
The Dalwhinnie 15 Year Old is a blend of around 35 single malt whiskies from Speyside, Islay, Campbeltown and Highland distilleries, with a rich, fruity character and a traditional Speyside malt flavour, with notes of sweetness and smokiness.
The entrance is rich and fresh, with a hint of chamomile and a strong smoky malt flavour.
The whiskey can be drunk on its own, with ice, or with the drinker's favorite mixer.
Scotch whisky enters China. In order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, red label whisky + Coca Cola or Sprite or other fizzy drinks become a fashion that lasts for a long time.
These sweetened beverages not only can neutralize acidity, but also can make people feel happy visually. They can improve the flavor of alcoholic beverages and change the taste.
Red whiskey + thin slices of orange peel + candy (or sugar) is the purest and most traditional way to drink it.
The original red wine taste is a little sour. Sugar can neutralize the acidity. Lemon can bring fresh flavor to the wine. Of course, the sweet-sour degree can be adjusted according to personal preferences.
The above three ways are the best ways to drink red whiskey. Everyone can try as a reference. I hope the introduction of the editor can help everyone.
Educational Thoughts: How University Exams Ensure that “Ace Students” and “Failing Students” get what they deserve - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, reflecting the confusion about the university examination, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the examination type, and make the examination truly reflect the actual ability of students.
In fact, university entrance examination has been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In the university, students come from all walks of life, and their ability is very different. In addition, the degree of learning is different. The situation of learning is very different.
It's unavoidable to have different feelings when assessing a group that has so many diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type and have high repetition, and if the questions are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a different feeling.
Students who do not study hard may be able to pass the examination by cramming before the examination. If other means are used, it may be twice as effective.
In this way, the phenomenon of “academic trash” can pass the examination and even get high scores even if they don’t put much effort, and the phenomenon of “academic bully” can attend class all the time, and their homework, notes, and test scores are all good.
It seems that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not unreasonable to reflect the problems in university examinations. This kind of situation should not only exist in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should applaud the three students who wrote letters of complaint.
In fact, everyone who has been to university knows that the phenomenon of cramming for exams, trying to get exam questions from teachers, widening the scope of exams, and getting special attention before the exam is not uncommon. Even the phenomenon of cheating in exams, and asking teachers to give preferential treatment after the exam is not unheard of.
In my view, as a teaching quality assessment orientation, the evaluation of whether a university is qualified is more related to the comprehensive understanding of teaching and learning by teachers, and the scientific setting of questions based on this.
At the undergraduate level in a university, the specialty begins to be subdivided, and many courses are based on basic knowledge.
Needless to say, whether comprehensively mastering the basic knowledge points of a discipline is one of the contents of university examinations.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the foundation theory and basic knowledge of the discipline. In terms of knowledge points, there is not much room for change. It is basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "the basic knowledge of mathematics learned in university 20 years ago is still being studied, and it is still the focus. "
However, the knowledge points are basically the same, and it does not mean that the test questions are monotonous and repeated.
In many universities, exams are generally set by examination committees, and then put together by senior teachers in the subject, and the marking is done by all the teachers of the subject, which can to some extent overcome the situation of test questions being repeated.
However, it is necessary to devise a set of test questions that are suitable for teaching and learning in practice. The questions should be based on the overall situation of students' learning. They should be distributed in a normal distribution curve. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively master the teaching and learning situation. It is necessary to comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the test questions can have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and question types. In addition, it is necessary to give full play to the examination of basic knowledge, and also consider the ability test. At the same time, it is necessary to innovate the design of test questions.
The exam is the baton of university education. With what kind of exam, students will have corresponding preparation plan. With time, it will affect the effect of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the suggestions of students and has deployed a plan for rectification throughout the whole university.
It is required that all teaching units organize teachers to carry out research and review and self-check of the final examination, design test papers and relevant regulations, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of the test paper designing and reviewing and examining process, refine the assessment, and strengthen the comprehensive examination of all parts of the course teaching.
From the perspective of the examination system, it is necessary to solve the problems such as the single type of test questions and the repeated questions. Of course, it is necessary to issue relevant regulations. However, the key lies in the daily routine. It is necessary for teachers to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. In addition to thoroughly understanding the teaching content, it is also necessary to thoroughly understand the learning situation of students. Both sides should be thoroughly understood. The teaching and learning will be better connected, and a good interaction will be formed. The examination will be more in line with reality. This will allow "academic stars" and "academic misfits" to get what they deserve.
If I can't change the location of my store, can I switch to delivery?
I don't need to give you any more money, do I?
The colleague’s order has already been delivered.
I can't get it to work.
What about GPS?
Ms. Chung's wedding photography (Nanjing Road store) has not yet branched out.
Before the shoot, we changed the time twice because of the time arrangement. The advisor Lan Lan was very patient to help us arrange the time.
I later chose a weekend with good weather to shoot.
Ms. Chan's staff, from advisers to makeup artists and photographers, are the best.
This was the first time I had my makeup done professionally. Oh my god, I can't believe I'm going to be that good looking one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and another girl (sorry, I forgot her name) are very patient and natural in makeup.
We were shooting in Jiangwancheng. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, so we didn't feel cold. The makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and head decorations from time to time. If there was something wrong, he would help us fix it immediately.
The photographer was also very humorous, and made me feel very happy throughout the day.
During the selection of photos, because there are a lot of cases on the Internet, we are unwilling to let the customers delete too many photos, but when we select photos, there is no intention to add photos at all. All 24 photos in the package are used directly (my cousin, who took wedding photos at about the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to a package of more than 7,000 yuan. At that time, I was stunned and scared that I would add too many photos)
The photos were fixed today. Lan Lan sent them to me. I felt that there were two photos that were not very good. They helped me to fix them immediately.
I took photos of my sister before and compared them. I am really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, which is exactly what I want.
I highly recommend everyone to go to Xi'an to take wedding photos of the Golden Couple!
Retail price: RMB3,999
Ms. Qin thanks you for your sincere wishes to her and wishes you a happy and promising future!

3,200 newborn babies in Sarawak do not have birth certificates as special anti-counterfeit paper is out of stock
(Sarawak, 11th October) The National Registration Department of Sarawak said that due to the depletion of special anti-forgery paper, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of this month. Up to now, a total of 3,200 people have been affected.
However, the director of the department, Khalu Aminu, assured that all babies who had applied for birth certificates had their data captured in the system and would be issued when the counterfeit certificates arrive next week.
He made an explanation at a press conference in response to a 10-month-long report by a web media on the issue of how long it took to print the newspapers in Sabah.
He said that the issue surfaced two months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturer of special anti-counterfeiting paper is affected by the epidemic and delayed to arrive in our country. "
He explained that the counterfeit papers used in Sarawak were different from those used in other parts of the country, and therefore could not be pledged as collateral in other states.
Kelu Amirudin revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit-proof paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6, and was handed over to the printing company on June 8 for some printing works.
“The office will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, and will immediately carry out the last stage of printing in Sarawak. It is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicants on December 20th. ”
We will notify applicants to collect the birth certificate at the local bureau. "
He added that a total of 24,801 birth certificates had been issued in Sarawak so far this year.
From 7:00 to now
Isn't it close now?
I'm referring to food

Xinhua Sarajevo, December 11 -- Cvejic, President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, said recently that Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and believes that China has the ability to hold a wonderful Winter Olympics in a special period.
The Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia, Qi Ping met with the President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic at the Olympic Center in Sarajevo.
During the meeting, Kvesic spoke highly of the relations between China and Belarus and said that he had visited China in 2008 during the Beijing Summer Olympics. He was deeply impressed by China's excellent organization work at that time. He believed that China had the ability to hold a splendid Winter Olympics in a special period. Bosnia-Herzegovina was looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Olympic Committee was actively organizing participation in the Games. Bosnia-Herzegovina hoped to take this opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sports.
Qi Ping said that there was a special "Olympic link" between China and Poland.
In 1984, the Sarajevo Winter Olympics was successfully held here. Two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will be opened. It will show the world a simple, safe and wonderful event.
We look forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the preparation of winter sports events, training of athletes, and other aspects.

We will take the opportunity of the Beijing Winter Olympics to promote the cultural exchanges between the two countries to continue to deepen, and wish that the people of both countries "move forward together". We also wish that the athletes in Bosnia and Herzegovina will perform well in Beijing.

Translate this from zh to en:zh:48 hours of negative nucleic acid test, set up "buffer zone", the State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism required to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reported by Dong Rufeng and Guo Tiancheng) - The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a notice on strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities at the land border on December 11, requiring people who have left the land port cities (except those with ports connected to Hong Kong and Macao) within the past 48 hours to present a negative nucleic acid test report, and people who have arrived in the land port cities from the land ports must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time limit for the above requirements is from the date of determination of the port city range and announcement by the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional port cities can study to set quarantine zones in their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border boundary trade is an important economic pillar, and there is frequent people-to-people exchanges between the two sides.
By implementing the policy of differentiated management according to regions, the control line will be changed from one to two, which is expected to move the control line forward to reduce the risk of spreading epidemics, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many domestic sporadic outbreaks in China, all of which are imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that it exposed some problems, such as that the epidemic monitoring and early warning were not timely, the closed-loop management of high-risk staff was not implemented, the regular nucleic acid testing was a formality, the disinfection of cold chain links was not up to standard, the management of centralized isolation sites was not standardized, and the epidemic response was not scientific and accurate enough.
The notice requires to focus on nine aspects, such as improving the mechanism of epidemic prevention and control in port cities, strengthening the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing the measures of border control, etc., to make up the shortcomings and weak links of epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and work on epidemic prevention and control with no laxness and accuracy.
The notice emphasized that all ports should research and deploy epidemic prevention and livelihood protection work in parallel, publish and open the hotline for livelihood protection, regularly check the potential risks of basic necessities supply and price, and timely solve and proactively respond to the acute problems raised by the masses.
According to the notice, the ports cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, and autonomous prefectures) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the cities (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the autonomous prefectures where the open land, water, and air ports are located. The specific scope shall be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

Exposing the bloody truth of US military for 20 years - Xinhuanet
(video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro documentary with the title "Killer Robots" on YouTube drew widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States waged war in Afghanistan under the guise of "anti-terrorism", and forced the export of American democracy through war. After 20 years of poverty-stricken, bloody and vicious warfare, the United States committed a series of crimes against humanity.
To use armed drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian sites, distorting human nature and forming a killer group.
Over the past 20 years, U.S. forces have killed thousands of Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up a "black jail" to subject the "suspects" to various torture and humiliation.
Each atrocity just feeds the hatred of the Afghans.
As the video said, the U.S. "war on terrorism" is getting more and more "terrible".
War has brought no peace, no democracy, no prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a ruined country and countless killings and destruction.
Translate this from zh to en:Let's watch the video together to expose the truth behind the US's "war on terror", its bloodthirsty killing spree under the guise of "democracy"!
I came across the following article by chance. From the perspective of business and shelf life, it discusses why this customer wants the logistics company in the free trade zone to pack the goods. Although packaging is a deep processing product that does not fall under the scope of business of the free trade zone logistics company, the following text may be able to explain why the customer wants to do so.
I went to many milk powder factories and saw many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of both powdered milk and liquid milk are the same. There is no difference between them.
So, everyone is bound to ask: why is the shelf life of the bagged product one year, whereas the shelf life of the powdered product is two years or more?
Or: Why is the price difference between ready-to-drink and bag-in-box so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers or mother-level think that it is because of the different raw materials that the quality will be much better.
In fact, the materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the expensive one is good.
There are also consumers who ate it and said that the aftertaste or flavor was different because of the imitation!
Now, I would like to tell you why we have to pretend to be deaf. Where is the dignity in that?
Why is there such a big difference in price when the raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the price is set too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturers is very low or even no profit. So, how can the manufacturers survive?
So, in terms of pricing, they have a lot of room to maneuver to make sure they keep their profit margins.
As a result, most manufacturers focus on earphone packaging, rather than bag packaging.
In addition, there are so many manufacturers who spend a lot of money on advertisements every year. Where does this money come from?
It goes without saying.
Thus, with the development of society and the promotion cost of the market, such as the promotion personnel of the shopping mall, the display cost of the shopping mall, the cost of product gifts, and the advertising cost will continue to increase.
Therefore, various manufacturers will continue to increase new products. In addition, the price of hearing aids will continue to rise. In fact, it is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost of their raw materials will not increase by more than 3-4 yuan.
Some brands go to great lengths to promote their products. They hook up with doctors in hospitals to help promote their products. They take a commission of 30 yuan to 80 yuan from the doctors.
In China, relevant laws absolutely do not allow this kind of operation. In fact, this kind of operation is harmful to consumers.
It is suggested that everyone should buy powdered milk in bags and put it into cans under the premise of having a can at home. This can save costs and increase the storage and sealing of the powdered milk. It will not have any impact on children.
In addition, everyone should not think that the shelf life of the ear packaging is longer than that of the bag packaging. If the shelf life of the ear packaging and that of the bag packaging is the same after opening the bag, but it is difficult to store the bag packaging after opening, and it is easy to absorb moisture and spoil.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and it was cold and hard after cooling, so there was no way to eat it

Don't chill your competitors at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When you go to a book market, you can often feel the popularity of books on success.
Nowadays, many successful books advocate the “best principle”, i.e., assuming or implying that you can “do it”, and then telling you what you should do.
In other words, it skips over the most important and fundamental part, which is how to do it.
As a result, these books all have a common feature: they are either full of enthusiasm and do their best, or they give up altogether; they are either 100% or 0%; they either climb to the top of the mountain or give up right where they are.
This "best principle" can be recognized as "absolutely correct" by everyone, but it will scare away 99% of people at the starting line.
This theory advocates a path of "taking a resolute decision, and making a 180-degree change", which is the fatal weakness of many people.
It is self-defeating to shout at people who are set in their ways, who resist change, that they need to change.
The vast majority of people will be intimidated by the word "change", will be hesitant, and will find it difficult to make a decision; or they will make a decision to make a change based on an impulse, and take a courageous first step, but it often doesn't last long, and they give up after a short while, and it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr Ma's famous "From tomorrow" skit is the epitome of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem of the Golden Rule is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limit of ordinary people and makes the vast majority of people "lament the door".
Perhaps, the "good enough" principle is a path that can lead more ordinary people to relative success.
The essence of the “next-best principle” is to “reduce the threshold”. It encourages the theory of “small victories lead to big victories”. That is, if you can’t get to 100, you can get to 1. Because 1 is always greater than 0. If you can’t climb Mt. Tai, you can climb the sand dunes in front of your house. Because that is also better than staying on the spot.
In general, doing something is better than doing nothing.
Since the threshold has been greatly reduced, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persevere, and the chance of success will be increased as long as they persevere.
It's just that the road to success following the principle of "the next best thing" is a little longer.
In essence, the "Pareto principle" with the slogan of "making everyone successful" can only inspire a small number of people in the end, while the "good enough principle" can effectively inspire more people and make more people benefit.

Qinghai Lake carp resources increase by 0.71 tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xining, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Reporters learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai that the latest monitoring results showed that the tonnage of Qinghai Lake crucian carp resources has increased by 710 tons from last year to this year, reaching 108,500 tons. Compared with the initial protection period of 2002, it has increased by more than 40 times.
The common name of the naked crucian carp in Qinghai Lake is "baitui", which is a precious fish species in Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety and diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s of the 20th century, the population of Qinghai Lake crucian carp was sharply reduced due to the factors of large-scale human hunting and the deterioration of spawning areas of crucian carp. In 2002, the resource stock of Qinghai Lake crucian carp was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the spotted crucian carp at Qinghai Lake was listed as endangered species in the Chinese Red List of Endangered Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has imposed a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and the main river and tributaries of Qinghai Lake, and banned the sale of carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial propagation and release and cleaning of the main inlet of Qinghai Lake, as well as designing scientific and reasonable "passage for fish" and other measures, the protection intensity of Qinghai Lake common carp resource is gradually increasing.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that up to now, nearly 180 million fish have been artificially enhanced and released into Qinghai Lake, accounting for more than 23% of the contribution to the restoration of Qinghai Lake crucian carp resources.
The Qinghai Three River Headwaters Region is an important ecological barrier and water replenishment area for China and even Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological area that controls the spread of desertification in the west.
Since this year, in order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake waters, to protect aquatic wild animals, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a total ban on fishing notices for the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has built a comprehensive ban on fishing management system covering "one river, one river, and one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, so I had to put it in the bag, and it was cold
Is the food delivered in a bag?
We only see one bag
I wonder if it was misdelivered or if someone took it, thanks
It's been an hour and they still haven't brought it
I just read an article that was way too long.
This is for guys who don't know.
Most girls will experience their first period between the ages of 13 and 15, and go through menopause in their 50s.
After that, it will be more regular, once a month, as long as my health permits.
However, this is not a regularity that can be accurately predicted. There is about a week of error, which needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes, bad luck will cause a turnover (suddenly several days in advance).
The duration, amount of blood loss, and severity of menstrual cramps vary from person to person; some last for three days, some for a week; some have little flow, some have a lot; some have no reaction, some are so bad that they need to be taken away in an ambulance; the severity of menstrual cramps will change over time; it doesn't mean that it won't hurt in the future even if it didn't hurt before.
It is impossible to control the menstruation. There will be continuous bleeding for several days from the beginning to the end. The only way is to use sanitary napkins or sanitary pads to stop the bleeding and prevent it from staining clothes and chairs.
Menstrual cramps are mainly caused by the excretion of prostaglandin. It is effective to take ibuprofen to relieve menstrual pain in the early stage of menstruation. However, it has no effect after the onset of menstrual pain.
During the premenstrual period, the uterus is filled with blood and excess progesterone is released, so it is easy to have stomach cramps.
If it's close to that time, you get stomach cramps for no reason, and you come on your period within two days.
It is best to change the sanitary napkin every 2-3 hours. Otherwise, it will breed bacteria. Excluding the time of sleep, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, every 7 days a month, which is 42 pieces. If you add the preparation, it may be 50 pieces. It is not one piece every month.
(This should be changed. The sanitary napkins do not need to be changed frequently. It should be changed every 5-6 hours, and the longest time should be 8 hours)
Hormones during your period might make you grouchy, and during ovulation your emotions might be all over the place, making you act out of character and land yourself in hot water.
However, the official crime rate data can show that the ability of women to control emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional problems as an excuse.
It isn't just blood; it includes the sloughed-off endometrial lining.
The endometrium (the inner lining of the uterus) is the thinnest after the menstruation. Then it gradually becomes thicker, which can be understood as that the uterus is like a house. Every month, the uterus builds a new house (the endometrium becomes thicker). When there is no guest, all the house is taken down (the menstrual blood is discharged). Then the uterus builds a new house again and again.
It is very inconvenient to have a period. For several decades, I bled for several days and nights every month, and I also suffered from abdominal pain and backache. Who would like it?
However, humans are born because of their mother's menstruation. The menstruation is for preparing the house for the first time when you come to this world. We should be grateful to our mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things of women were suppressed. The society brainwashed women as dirty and ashamed. Everyone thought it was like that. But the times have changed.
If someone thinks that menstruation is disgusting, and thinks that the process of making preparations for pregnancy is disgusting, then they shouldn’t say it in front of a crowd. Girls, get up. Don’t think about it anymore. No one has ever experienced it, and no one will ever experience it. These men, who don’t know good or bad, don’t know how to be grateful, shouldn’t be so ungrateful. How can they face their own mothers, and how can they want their own children?
Lastly, give the sanitary pads a go; they're really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival. It is disappointing to send the wrong thing
They have a special children's menu
We hope that the shop owners will take a few minutes to check the products when they are busy.
Did you get an electric shock in the foot bath?
A suitable foot bath basin can have a good therapeutic effect on the feet. Today, Gome will answer this question. Hope it will be helpful to friends.
As people's health awareness increases, foot bath basins are becoming more and more popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different grades have emerged on the market. From more than 100 yuan to more than 1000 yuan, foot bath basins are dazzling, providing consumers with a large space for choice.
On the related data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of health appliances such as massage tank are booming. However, there is no specific industry standard for massage tank, so there are certain safety hazards.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!"
Mr Li told the reporter that he bought a foot bath basin as a birthday gift for his father recently, but his father felt numb after soaking his feet.
Mr Li thought it was caused by the vibration of the footbath at first. However, when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt the numbness in his feet.
Mr Li tried writing with a pencil and was surprised to find that the pencil lit up. He discovered that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant’s attitude was not bad, even though he returned the foot bath basin, Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry standard for foot bath tubs that have been popular for a long time, such as at what temperature it should be set, who it should be used by, what materials should be used to ensure safety, etc.
However, generally speaking, a foot bath will not have a problem with electricity, but there may be some products that do not go through strict inspection before leaving the factory.
So, when purchasing, opt for a separate foot bath.
Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can measure anything with a pencil.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Online - Hunan Online - Huochuang Online
The Hunan Daily reported on December 10 (reporter Zhang Shan Wu Hong Man, correspondent Liu Xia Ling, photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and the Red Tea Promotion Conference were held in the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The event showcased the tea industry, innovative tea technology, and the promotion of tea culture, and accelerated the pursuit of the goal of a tea industry worth 100 billion yuan.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the Executive Council of the All-China Federation of Supply and Cooperation, and Ye Hong, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: the source of Huang Red Tea in Xinhua injects new vitality to the “Hunan Tea”.
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have vigorously supported the development of tea industry, promoted the construction of a tea industry with a value of 100 billion yuan, and formed a development pattern of "Hunan Tea, Three Waters, Five Colors".
The tea industry in the province has stepped up innovation, and the main tea types such as green tea, black tea, and red tea have taken turns to make contributions. The tea-tourism integration in the main production areas has boosted the income of tea farmers.
Feng shui is cyclical, and red tea is reinvigorated.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after completing the green tea harvest, the farmers can earn income from the harvest of red tea, black tea, and that the output value of tea gardens will increase all year round.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders presented licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the “Hunan Red Tea” trademark, and Xihu brought “Hunan Red Tea’s Root”.
In the new tea exhibition hall, Fujian tea merchants saw a high-mountain tea called "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Jun, Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market to some extent, but from the scene of the Tea Expo, there are many highlights.
The red tea of Xinhua is red and infused with the connotation of tea culture. It is popular and has a lot of transactions. The Hubei tea industry ushers in a new spring.

Philosophy is the study of problems that cannot be solved by direct perception, but require rational inference and logic.
Formal logic is the foundation of philosophy, and is concerned with explaining the fundamental properties of being and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is taken from the "System Commentary" of the Book of Changes: "That which is above is called Dao, that which is below is called De". This was translated by Japanese people, Ishizawa Tetsuji (in the Meiji period), from the word "metaphysic".
Philosophical branches include ontology, natural theology and related problems.
Thomism is "the study of what names really denote, and what names merely denote".
Naturalism in philosophy is the denial of the existence of God.
It is based on the theory that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, which was proposed by philosophers who supported science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism is the view that all phenomena should be explained in terms of natural processes.
Psychology is the study of the mind and its relationship with the body, especially the brain.
Polytheism and monotheism are the two main schools of thought with respect to the relationship between spirit and matter.
Epistemology is the study of the nature, origins, and limits of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic study of morality, i.e. of all the rules that a group of people or a culture recognizes as binding.
It is divided into two main branches: deontological ethics (abstractly studying ethical theory or the essence of criticism) and consequentialist ethics (judging various different ethical views and giving ethical guidelines for right or wrong actions.
It studies what kind of ethical behavior people should follow, applied ethics (which applies ethical theory to real life situations, such as biomedical ethics, political ethics), and descriptive ethics (which collects information about how people live and makes generalizations from that).
It is not an examination of ethics from the standpoint of a hypothetical agent, but an investigation of actual decisions made by moral agents (that is, human beings), and the ethical factors involved in those decisions, and the social groups to which they belong.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, and Christian ethics in the Middle Ages.
First part: Humanist ethical thought, represented by Vera and Montaigne, etc.
The second part is the ethical teachings of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
The third part is the political ethics, which is represented by Machiavelli and others, the modern ethics (in the 17th and 18th centuries, the English utilitarian ethics, represented by Hume and others, the continental rationalism ethics (in the 17th and 18th centuries, the French enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire and others, the German academy ethics (in the 18th and 19th centuries, the English evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Hegel, and the German neo-Kantian ethics (in the 19th and 20th centuries, the German new Hegelian ethics (in the 19th and 20th centuries, the German new Hegelian ethics (in the 19th and 20th centuries, the German new Hegelian ethics (in the 19th and 20th centuries, the German new Hegelian ethics (in the 19th and 20th centuries, the German new Hegelian ethics (in the 19th and
Logic is concerned with the "principles and standards of valid reasoning and proof".
Logic generally consists of three parts: induction, deduction, and abduction, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is concerned with the nature and significance of beauty.

This is Ding Zilun to you.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after the death of our relatives. In particular, I thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance since my appeal for humanitarian assistance in 1994, which has continued to this day.
Today, most of the parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, married and have jobs.
Your generosity will help us survive this most difficult time.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is rampaging across the world, and most donors are retired.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop the humanitarian fund-raising for us - the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian relief activity should have drawn a perfect conclusion a long time ago.
I will always cherish your love and believe that your kindness will be recorded in history.
I can only express myself in this way because of various reasons, so I hope my friends can understand!
Please accept my sincere condolences.
Tao Yibo said that he would like to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the history of IFCSS and MCDF, which has been carrying out humanitarian relief for 32 years.
In the process of providing humanitarian relief, AMCHAM Minnesota is a parallel organization to the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation, and the project implementors often have cross-over.

The relief funds are often unable to be delivered to the hands of the victims of June 4th.
In 1994, under the suggestion of Ding, a special group was set up by the "Mothers of Tiananmen Square" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "June 4 Orphans Education Fund", and after 11 years, in 2009, MCDF set up the "June 4 Orphans and Elderly Poverty Relief Fund", and it has been implemented until today.
The funding for these projects was sourced from campus and social fundraising in 1989, generous individual donations, and support from the Hong Kong University Democratic Foundation.
It has received support from the Labor Reform Research Institute since 2018.
Until last year, after 31 years, the Tiananmen Square martyrs finally received part of the donation raised in the name of June 4th in Hong Kong.
During this time, China Human Rights was also carrying out its humanitarian assistance projects independently.
We understand that Ms. Ding stopped the fund-raising for June 4. This is for the consideration of donors. We are indeed some retired people. Our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We hereby express our thanks to Ms. Ding for her "Letter to Friends".
We will respect the wishes of our members and will withdraw from this project within two years, and will re-introduce it if needed.
I would like to express my thanks and respect to those comrades who have always insisted on making generous contributions and delivering humanitarian aid at great personal risk for many years.

[Effect] Photo effect: I took two sets of clothes. Overall, it's not bad. I like this set of photos the most.
[Service] Service details: I was a little uncomfortable during makeup because of pregnancy. The makeup artist and staff were very thoughtful. I took a break on one side and they kept pouring hot water for me
Set price: 1000 yuan
Thanks to the rabbit's review. Originally, I said that the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you, Dandan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction will make us full of power to move forward. We will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great! I highly recommend it to all my friends!
There was nothing wrong with the reception, make-up, costumes, lighting, photography and post production.
The make-up artist is very meticulous, and will match the make-up according to your style. The make-up products used are all high-end brands.
Mr. Tian Liang, in particular, is quite professional in photography.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two little kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing. The better photo studios in Beijing require an appointment half a year in advance. A colleague has taken photos in Beijing. I looked at the results and felt just so-so.
I specifically looked for this workshop, a place with soul and attitude.
We have poor facial expression management. We feel that this is the short version of most people. The photographer, Lang Jia, will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
A makeup artist, a photographer, post production, a well-trained team.
It's just amazing to see it all come together.
I've already recommended it to my bestie, and she loved it just as much as I did.
I hope that this kind of studio will not be buried, and more people will find it, shoot their own style, and not be the same as others.
Thank you for the five-star review from Zhang Yan and Qing Ling. Both of them are very creative new people. We are a creative workshop. We will do our best to satisfy our customers. Thank you for meeting and getting to know each other.
The sweet and thoughtful assistant, as well as the lively and exuberant photographer teacher, everyone in the team is very nice. This is a very wonderful shooting experience, and the effect is much better than I imagined. Thank you all. 😘😘
Thank you, Xiaoyu, for your comment. It is also a kind of destiny to meet you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, our trust in you is a journey of thousands of kilometers. I am happy to meet you. I will come to Qinhuangdao again in the future.

A programming novice who wants to share his personal experience.
If you want to join this industry, you can choose to find a place for training. However, if you do not have this idea, it is better to self-study. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it will take 6 months to learn.
However, if you want to get into the trade, training is a great option, especially for those who are lacking in willpower.
If you have a strong self-discipline, you can choose self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, we should look at the teacher strength of this institution. If the teacher strength is not strong enough, then this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong teacher strength.
Second, inquire about the training institution before choosing. It is best to inquire about the students of this training institution. After all, only students know how good or bad this institution is.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question. Because I haven't made a certain introduction to your own situation. And the relationship between learning and one's own situation is very big.
For example, specialisation, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you want to live in will be related to the industry you want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you are a computer major who has graduated, I recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. In fact, many offline and online training institutions are very good. However, the learning cost is high, and the time investment is relatively large. You need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
However, if it were me, it would be very convenient to self-study. Now there are many learning resources on the Internet that are free, or there are many training resources on B站. If you do not know how to find resources, you can contact me via the introduction to obtain free resources or detailed consultation.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with videos to study.
If you are not a computer major, but you are willing to pay a certain learning cost and time cost, it is recommended to learn at a training institution. This way, learning will not be very tiring. The teacher’s explanation will be detailed, and there will be people to answer your questions. In addition, it will be helpful in learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions will sign employment agreements. There will be internal recommendations, and after learning, the recommendation will be made to the company. This will save a lot of trouble in the interview process later.
This is my opinion. I have only briefly introduced it because I do not know your situation. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
I said, one minute before, I saw it on the app

Cleaning is both work and duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.

Only with sincerity can success be achieved, and only with meticulousness can exquisiteness be molded. We are serious about making a beautiful seam.
Give me a chance and I will make you satisfied. Quality speaks for everything, because professionalism deserves to be trusted. Your encouragement is what I appreciate the most!
It’s hard to do anything these days!
But I always believed that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard-working, I will be better than others, at least better than complaining.
Everything begins in the morning. May you start the day with happiness, good luck, health, and good luck. Start the day with a good mood and stay in a good mood all day. Good morning
When I was young, happiness was something that could be obtained; when I grew up, happiness was something that could be achieved; and when I became mature, I discovered that happiness was a state of mind, and understanding brought happiness.
To be the most authentic and kind-hearted version of yourself, and to follow your heart. There is only one path in life, and that is your own. There are two treasures in life: a healthy body and a good mood. Live life to the fullest!
Every stage of life has its challenges.
Often it isn't ability that holds you back, it's the courage to try.
If you can't avoid it, then you might as well face it.
The more you fear, the more you are defeated; the more you challenge, the more problems will be solved.
China-Saudi Arabia Curators Jointly Present Saudi Arabia's First Biennale of Contemporary Art - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (reported by Wang Haizhou and Hu Gang) - The Saudi Arabian Contemporary Art Biennale - Diriyah Biennale of Contemporary Art was officially opened to the public on the 11th in Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries participated in the exhibition.
This biennale was jointly planned by Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and UCCA Center for Contemporary Art. Tian Wei, curator of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, was the art director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this Biennale is "Picking up Stones", which symbolizes the reform strategy adopted during the social and economic transition period, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabian society and culture.
This biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition spans across six connected buildings. It is presented in six units: “Touching the Rock across the River”, “Inheritance as an Experiment”, “Thinking on the Edge”, “Going to the Public”, “Beautiful New World”, and “The Spirit of Art”.
In particular, the works of 27 Saudi Arabian artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of works in this exhibition, including painting, installation art, and performance art, and the works of 12 Chinese artists were also well-received. For example, Xu Bing used recycled materials in a novel way in his work Infinite Story Series: Xishanwu (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting.
Barkley, Executive Director of the Sharjah Biennial Foundation, said that the biennial hopes to establish an international dialogue and give global audiences an opportunity to understand the cultural industry and creative communities that are flourishing in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interactions and exchanges.
Tian Weiyu said, "The goal of the biennale is dual. It can enable Saudi Arabian contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, and enable Saudi Arabian audience to integrate into the contemporary art world. "
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennale. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of public service positions in villages - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (reported by Lin Bifei) - In order to continue to do a good job in employment assistance for poverty-stricken people, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently introduced relevant policies for the management of public-spirited positions in rural revitalization to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public service positions, which are used for employment of rural poverty-stricken labor force, and have played an important role in helping the poverty-stricken groups achieve employment, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the public services in rural areas.
This new regulation was jointly issued by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and other seven departments. It mainly standardizes the object range, fund management, job development, and job management in the recruitment of rural public service positions.
In terms of position development and setting, the new regulations clearly stipulate that it should be carried out in accordance with the principles of “demand-oriented, job-oriented, dynamic management, and quantitative control”, as well as the principles of “who develops, who uses, who bears responsibility”, and “one person, one position, voluntary publicity, and unified management”.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, examination, publicity, employment, pre-employment training and employment arrangement.
In addition, the new regulation also clearly stipulates the specific duties of the main development departments of rural public service positions, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public service positions, and stipulates that the development departments of rural public service positions should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the rural public service position settlers; and require the relevant departments to regularly monitor the subsidy distribution of rural public service positions.

2. Although the rightists had a prosperous age in history, it was not long, so it was short. It was short because it was bright with a little sunshine and sweating with a cup of water; it was high because it looked down on Sichuan and suffered setbacks.
But in all fairness, right-wingers have made positive contributions to social progress.
The positive significance of the rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the definition of the standard of truth during the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of governance and the protection of human rights.
Three, as far as I am concerned, although I do not agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I am very concerned about his statements and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, and he is sincere about China, and he is sincere about the social problems in China.
But I am against his theory of anti-communism. I think that the counter-revolution is unnecessary. The revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, people's livelihood, and political groups will be mixed with mud and silt.
Changing or improving China should be done with patience and the attitude of being responsible to the country and the people. Those who make political speculation in the fire will not be rightists, but scoundrels.
Let's talk about this.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of orphans of the times and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing views and analyses of their ideas when needed. However, the left has nothing to do with the Communist Party, because the left wants exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth, I have seen some friends lash out at robbers while shaking, and I think it is unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with a traitor or a leftist. They are all stubborn and illogical.
Also, don't try to prove us right, and don't try to make the robbers and lunatics admit it, why should we?
To my friends, I would say: when robbers abuse you and leftists abuse you, it proves that we are right in the middle way!
Many people have ideal when they were young, but forgot the ideal or pursue the ideal and become obsessive.
They grow further and further apart, and in the end, the idealist becomes the villain.
To me, left and right generally mean restraint and freedom. Historically and culturally, China has a natural inclination towards the left.
The right wing in China focuses on efficiency and development, while the left wing pays more attention to supervision and cares more about fairness and safety.
In general, the society wants to pay more attention to fairness now. Meanwhile, the competition between China and the United States is inevitable. It is certain that it will continue for many years.
It doesn't matter if you don't understand. Just give it a thumbs up.
Just say that Flower is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and encirclement of Huawei chips by the U.S. has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also inflicted huge losses on the "U.S. system" enterprises.
The U.S. suppressed China's semiconductor industry and required its own enterprises and allied enterprises in China to block China's semiconductor industry at the same time. This had a direct consequence of affecting the orders and profits of global semiconductor suppliers. This led to the reduction of R&D investment and production capacity of semiconductor manufacturing enterprises, which in turn led to the disorder of global semiconductor supply chains.
Today, the "chip shortage" has affected all major industries around the world. For example, automobile production has been halted, and mobile phones have risen in price. Almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to obtain the sovereignty of "chips", more and more countries of technology giants begin to take the road of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry and suppress the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the United States has made frequent moves in recent days. It has hosted the semiconductor summit and invited 64 countries as founding members of the semiconductor alliance, and it has also supported the domestic technology giants of the United States, such as Intel, the time-honored technology giant of the United States, with billions of dollars to reclaim its leading position in the field of semiconductors by building two semiconductor factories in Arizona in the United States and opening its semiconductor foundry business to the outside world.
Most people thought that Intel's action would have a certain impact on TSMC, and it was very likely to steal TSMC's "cake".
This is because Intel, as a veteran technology giant in the United States, has been engaged in semiconductors for several decades and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves. It must be able to quickly rise up and defeat TSMC in a short period of time.
However, for Intel’s decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongzhe disregarded it.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongbo made a surprising statement. He said that Intel's investment in building a wafer factory was ridiculous.
Zhang Zhongmao's contempt for Intel's entry into the semiconductor wafer field is because he still remembers the grudge between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was a bright pearl in the U.S. manufacturing industry. It occupied the pinnacle of the world and was the hegemon of the world’s semiconductor industry.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were controlled by a small number of strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was completed by one factory from design, manufacturing, and encapsulation. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model made some small enterprises overburdened. Many semiconductor entrepreneurs could not afford the huge cost of building production lines.
In the face of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to see the phenomenon of division of labor cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmo heard that there was a special company to design chips. He thought that since there was a special company to design chips, then it would be possible to establish a special factory to produce wafers.
Soon, Zhang Zhongmo's idea becomes reality, and TSMC is born.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has set its sights on the "wafer fabrication" segment, and does not engage in design, but only provides contract manufacturing services for the fabrication of wafers.
Taiwan Semiconductor, which was just established at that time, was just a puppy in the face of Intel, the giant.
To obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmo once approached Intel for investment. However, Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing segment of the semiconductor industry, and was obviously quite arrogant and looked down on TSMC. Consequently, it resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmao also determined that Intel at that time looked down upon wafer processing services.
It is surprising that the giant who looked down upon the wafer fabrication service in the past now also has to start wafer foundry.
So, Zhang Zhongmo felt that it was ironic for Intel to enter the Wafer Foundry.
Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel.
Facing the strong attack of TSMC, Intel is naturally not willing to stay still.
Today, TSMC is pushing for 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm chips from seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
Come on!
We ordered at 19:06 after 2 hours😅
Let's take a look at some of today's [weird] search trends.
What is normal public opinion?
Please translate this from Chinese to English: Zh: Select three hot searches at random: the uprising of the dragon on February 2nd, the price increase of goodluck, and the warehousing incident. The propagation forms a peak, and then [the index decreases] (smooth curve) is finally dissipated. If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small peak again.
They look identical to the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" that was once displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration.
What's the difference between normal and abnormal public opinion?
We randomly selected six keywords from the same event to display the "peak", "hump", and "cliff" phenomena.
This is called the “peak”, which is artificially heated and quickly climbed to the hot search, attracting the attention of the masses; this is called the “serrated”, which is cyclically heated to ensure that the hot search occupies the hot search rankings; this is called the “cliff”, which is collectively withdrawn, and the hot search has played its “role”, and has received new tasks and rushed to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of an event coincides with the trough of another event, and the time and seconds are exactly the same, which must be the task of a unified army to launch a new round of attack.
The professionalism of black public relations can be seen from the fact that dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time. Which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for science popularization, which ones are used to start a war, which ones are used to divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones are misleading judgments, which ones are used to arouse emotions, which ones are used to influence decision-making, black public relations accounts are divided into batches and nodes, and almost every element in the spread of public opinion is considered.
Spreading is a science. All subjective factors, such as position and emotion, should be set aside, and only objective data should be used. Even black public relations will have no place to hide.
Anyone who passes by must leave a trace. Let's dig it out together.
The data comes from Hot Search Machine.
Mauritius reports first case of omicron variant - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 - Comprehensive reports by the foreign correspondents of Xinhua News Agency: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi reported for the first time that the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus had been detected in patients.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant on 10th day of the month.
The Ministry of Health announced that an infected person is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27, while the other infected person is a local resident who had contact with a person who had been to South Africa recently and tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30.
The two patients, who were isolated at the hospital, tested negative for the virus and were allowed to return home.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that three cases of infection with the Omicron variant had been confirmed in the country for the first time.
All three were students who had returned from overseas at the beginning of this month, and were not hospitalized as they were mild cases.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Senegalese government has stepped up efforts to contain the virus.
From December 6 to January 10, passengers aged 12 and above who arrive in Zambia by air will be charged for nucleic acid testing at the airport.
The Zambian Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it would start to administer Pfizer vaccines to children aged 5 to 11.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Khumbize Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country had detected three cases of infection with the Omicron variant for the first time.
The country's health authorities analyzed 12 new coronavirus samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and found these 3 infections.

360-degree integrated home decoration
Address: No. 156, Huancheng Nanlu, 12th Floor, Happiness Garden
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 for basic decoration.
It starts with a series of scams when you arrive at the shop.
I went to the shop for the first time just to show them my floor plan. They did not go to the site to measure the house. However, they were able to quote a price of RMB70,000 for my 135-square-meter house. They also showed me their materials, but I did not know what kind of materials they were.
They have a second trick up their sleeve, which is that if you go into the shop, they will drag you into putting a deposit down (which is non-refundable, unless you have enough experience and know-how to argue with them).
While you're debating whether or not to stump up a deposit, they'll invite their so-called manager to tell you that the more you put down, the bigger the discount you'll get.
This is a big trap. I am a living example. I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan in a moment of impulsiveness.
He quoted a price of RMB 70,000, which did not include water and electricity, and did not include any doors or cabinets or bathroom. These three items are the biggest expenses in the base price.
They charge more for their services than other companies do.
I lost faith in the company, and they didn't explain anything to me before I signed the contract.
They were very experienced at dealing with people like me who wanted their money back.
At the end of the day, it's the customer's problem if they can't pay.
There are various shirking of responsibilities and many details. I don't want to say them one by one. In short, don't choose them because my friend's house renovated by them is also of poor quality. They will add various costs to you in the after-sales service.
It is ridiculous. They are just the decoration of the original fraudsters. Now they are changed to the decoration of big and beautiful. It seems that they have been bankrupt and changed to other decorations.
So please, stay away from this kind of decoration company.
In the future, when you choose, you can Baidu and check these consultations. After all, the decoration is not a small amount of money.

Is there no other way, like changing the address?
Alright, then don't cancel the conversation. If you don't return my money within 5 to 10 days, I will pursue you.
Is it possible to cancel after 15 minutes?

The Geminid Meteor Shower peaks on the 14th day of the month - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reported by Zhou Runjian) -- An expert in astronomy popularization explained that as the last large meteor shower of this year, the Gemini meteor shower, which is one of the three large meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will have a great peak on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe it after midnight on the same day.
This is the Taurus Meteor Shower captured by Beijing astronomer An Ji on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
The parent body of most meteorite showers is a periodic comet, but the parent body of the Geminid meteorite shower is the 3200 Phaethon asteroid, which is an Apollo type asteroid.
The Geminid Meteorite Shower is also the second known meteorite shower that was not "born" by a comet.
Shu Binpeng, a member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an astronomy popularization expert, said that just like the New Year’s blockbuster, the Geminid Meteor Shower generally appears at the end of the year. The “screening period” can last from December 4 to December 17.
The meteor shower is known for its high intensity and stability. It is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere along with the Leonids and Geminids.
One distinctive feature of the Geminid Meteor Shower is that the speed of the meteorites is slow, the color is rich, and there are a lot of fireballs. It is suitable for beginners to take pictures with both naked eyes and astronomical photography.
Tianjin astronomer Yang Jing on December 13, 2020 captured the Taurus Meteor Shower in Qingzhou, Tianjin.
The astronomical forecast shows that the Geminid meteorite rain this year will peak at around 15 o'clock on December 14. The ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observation conditions, with the radiant point directly above the observer) will be 150.
The Geminid Meteorite Shower Recommendation Chart.
Last year, the Geminid meteorite shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteorite shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the wonderful degree will be a little discounted.
The 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar was on the 14th day of the month. The phase of the moon was a waning gibbous moon, and the bright moonlight would cause interference in observation. Fortunately, the moon would set after midnight, and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower would be higher at this time.
If you like meteor shower, you can observe it in the several hours after the moon sets in the later night. However, it is necessary to pay attention to avoiding cold and staying warm.
How can we try to see as many shooting stars as possible?
"It is not advisable to observe in the city. It is better to choose a place with high altitude, little light pollution, and with a wide view facing northeast. Then, you can observe after the moon has set after waiting patiently.
It is important to note that the Geminid Meteor Shower radiates in all directions, so you do not have to keep looking at the radiant point of the Geminid Meteor Shower.
For friends who like photography, in order to shoot a splendid “meteorite rain”, it is best to choose a wide-angle and a large aperture lens, and use high ISO and the maximum aperture during shooting.
Based on the considerations of stability and continuity, a tripod, a spare battery and a shutter cord are also indispensable. "
Chen Shuangping said.
What is the difference in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the poster should be liquid crystal TV. And there are two main differences between laser TV and liquid crystal TV in terms of market positioning:
First, the laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the all-round market positioning of liquid crystal televisions, laser televisions are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or it can be said that laser televisions were born for large screens.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV size is between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for large screen color TV.
In recent years, the shipment and sales of laser TVs have been increasing worldwide. They accounted for more than 60% of the total sales of 80-inch and above TVs.
According to the forecast of China Joy, the market sales of laser TVs will increase by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for its outstanding performance in the large screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent eye care performance of laser TV.
Based on the imaging principle of backlight reflection of laser TV, the light from the laser source does not directly enter the eye. Compared with the backlight source of liquid crystal TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of natural conditions, and the irritation to the eye is also smaller.
The Sesi Laboratory of China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute and ophthalmologists from Beijing Huashan Hospital carried out strict comparative tests on laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same crowd conditions, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms that laser TVs do have very strong eye-friendly characteristics, and in some aspects can even make improvements.
In a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TVs have not only attracted more and more users with their eye-friendly advantages, they have also opened up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, the laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
While the price of liquid crystal televisions continues to decline, the price of currently sold laser televisions is mostly above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price gradually rises.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV and projector.
Thanks to the super short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is relatively short compared with the traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance. It needs a small space. The main unit is small and takes up little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 nits.
In addition, the heat dissipation is lower, and the equipment consumption is small, so the lifespan of the television is also longer.
In addition to this, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, organic screen and other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more amazing visual and audio experience.
This is not false demand, but a product of subdivision of demand. In terms of picture quality and cost-benefit ratio, laser TV is not a meal for audio players. If you want to combine a large screen and the viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has its pros and cons. After weighing the pros and cons, we can make our own judgments. We should not be fooled by one-sided words.
In simple terms, the ultra-wide angle close-focus projector—laser TV—to get close to the screen had to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and mirrors, which did not conform to the best optical design.
To filter out some of the ambient light, a micro-structured Fresnel screen is used, which is expensive, and the price of a 80-inch screen is basically equivalent to that of a 65-inch LCD.
In addition, I particularly dislike the fact that the projector manufacturers use the advantage of mirror reflection on the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is just direct light. If it is reflected on the ceiling, the eyes can’t see it either. So, why can’t the liquid crystal TV also be “direct light”? The ceiling of the TV is also lit up, isn’t it?
In addition, the projection screen cannot become an image without being diffused.
In fact, the hot spots (spots) of high-gain screens are ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
The Selected Quality Stores of the Photography Gallery of Visual Aesthetics
I added the WeChat booking date, and the lady arranged the available time for me. The reply was quite timely.
I looked at the photos taken in the shop beforehand. Most of them were outdoor wedding photos, which were very beautiful. There were many shooting styles involved.
That day, I exchanged my idea with the lady, and she was very patient to help me try two sets of clothes that I was confused about. Finally, we decided to start makeup and hairstyle. The photographer will prepare some props before shooting, and will guide the action. He is also very meticulous about every detail.
However, it may be because I have not communicated the specific ideas of shooting to you, so the result is not what I want, but it should be good-looking.
After the shoot, the photographer will help select the photos and discuss the post-production style. He is quite thoughtful.
It takes about half a month to repair the film. We have to wait for the effect.
It's the second time for me to take part in a photo marathon. Almost all clothes in the venue can be chosen for shooting.
I ended up choosing a black crepe dress and experiencing a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, including make-up and shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is the younger brother of the 95 generation. I feel a little shy. I hope he can give more advice on the guidance of customer shooting actions in the future. He is quite talkative. The shooting process is quite pleasant.
The Best Quality Stores of Photography Gallery of Visual Aesthetics
Be the first to translate this from Chinese to English:
First, fill in your name and phone number at the store. Then, you can choose the dress and wedding dress. You can try on three or four sets of dresses, and they are very patient. After choosing the dress, the makeup takes a long time. The service attitude is also good. Later, they will teach you how to pose. However, the face looks big after shooting. The post-processing takes half a month. It takes three or four days to send the pictures. It feels like there is no difference from the original pictures
The overall situation is good.
There are a lot of options for clothing.
There are about three make-up positions, and there is a photography studio in the middle.
Quite friendly and attentive.
The stylist was very patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you the moves.
Photographers will also proactively offer to retake the shot if they are unsatisfied.
[Experience] The eyelid may be a little too exaggerated. The original double eyelid was made into a three-eyed eyelid.
The eyebrows are also shaved, which is embarrassing for those who do not draw eyebrows in daily life.
The photo was given to me a few days ago, but I am not satisfied with the photo editing effect. I feel that the effect of the double eyelid is still very obvious.
Because I don't know what kind of style I want. I tried two sets, but in the end, I still chose a black dress. The lady said that this set is more of a retro Hepburn style
After choosing the clothes, I started to make up. The hairdresser and makeup artist are very patient in helping me. I am very satisfied with the result
I started taking photos after I was done with makeup and hair. The photographer directed me throughout the whole process. It was very easy and harmonious
After the shoot, I carefully selected four photos that I liked best. The little brother said that the film was complete. I was very satisfied with the ending.
3 days and counting... as your system doesn't recognise my credit card you won't be able to add me to the #PRS_ORG# Plus scheme!
The weird thing is, I always use the same credit card to pay

Is it okay to exempt you from the monthly fee first, and then collect it after you have finished your investigation?
Is it reliable for umbrella companies to buy insurance?
Little Umbrella is an insurance agency platform on the Internet.
From the perspective of setting conditions, according to the suggestion of the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage (Revised in 2015)", in order to become an insurance brokerage company, it must meet three key words: the shareholders and founders must have no major violations in the past three years, the minimum amount must be no less than RMB 50 million, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very demanding. In summary, it is necessary to have strength, to be approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, and to have a good attitude of the shareholders. As a small umbrella insurance, the policyholders do not need to question whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate. After all, there are these three criteria. Not all insurance companies can meet them.
That's good, it's reliable.
In terms of insurance products, the small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform. For example, the latest Anda Super Mary 5 critical illness insurance, the claiming party and the insurer are Anda Life Insurance, and the small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to doubt its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: the product of Internet platform, because it has saved the cost of operation of business outlets and the cost of salaries of agents, so the Internet product is generally more cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the pressure of payment of insured persons, and can maximize the lever of insurance.
That's a very good thing.
Consider it.
From the perspective of the professionalism of agents: this is particularly important, because insurance is an industry that requires a high degree of professionalism. Many Internet product customers can themselves purchase insurance. This will lead to a lot of misconceptions. In terms of health declaration and occupation, non-insurance professionals will often add their subjective ideas when purchasing insurance. They think they are healthy or meet the requirements. This will easily lead to a lot of claims risks and the possibility of being denied claims.
I used to make insurance phone calls on Tencent Micro-insurance (just like the umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance agency), so I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is real and reliable. What is unreliable is people. The Internet channel does not have professional personnel, and there are many sales misdirection.
For example: 1 yuan insurance for 6 million, buy insurance and get a mobile phone, free to get 600,000 critical illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are superficial. They do not tell the insured people that the first month is 1 yuan, and the second month is charged according to the normal price, ranging from a few to 200, many customers do not know what they have paid for.
You think you can spend a dollar and get $600,000 from the insurance company (falling for the bait).
Free mobile phone delivery is only for special insurance numbers, such as 6666 and 8888. And if you win the short message and do not exchange it, no one will remind you.
(This is a trap for the insured. It is free to get a 60,000 RMB critical illness insurance. However, it is only valid for a short period of time. If you only rely on this and do not have any other commercial insurance, what can you do with 60,000 RMB if you get a critical illness? You will be exposed to life without insurance in the future.
The government is also cracking down on misleading information about internet insurance sales.
In summary, the platform is fine, the product is fine, and the problem is with the professionalism and work ethic of the business representatives.
I suggest that the OP should comprehensively consider this. In fact, many offline insurance agencies have more products. Customers can choose more opportunities and products. And some products have better cost performance than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to insure offline products, saving RMB 2,000-3,000 per year per person.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
I: I have more than 3 years of experience in enterprise management training and have served nearly a thousand enterprise users. I have cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I will start from the needs of customers to customize insurance products for customers. During the purchase of insurance, I will compare three insurance companies for customers. I will try my best to get the best underwriting result for customers. After purchasing insurance, I will organize insurance policies, custodial services, and make customers feel at ease.
Lifelong growth with every customer.
I hope my answer will be helpful to the OP!
According to the definition of the insurance regulator, internet insurance refers to insurance business that can be completed by the policyholder autonomously after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance agent does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although the insurance of the Internet has no "ritual feeling", and even may not have the printed paper contract, but it will not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "call center" operation. However, there will be a fatal problem when purchasing insurance in this way. That is, the after-sales service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for several decades. When we purchase insurance, we should think carefully about the "intermediary" we choose. Is it an "insurance intermediary" that can be with us for a long time and provide services in many years later?
How do I contact the delivery specialist?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Do you want to compensate me?
I said I would like to deliver the goods.
But the cyclist just left it at the door and went away.
They go out of their way to mess things up

Thank you.
In the past, I have always objected to any form of defamation and abuse, and I can't accept this type of personal attack.
In a civilised society we can be tolerant of everything, but we must not tolerate evil.
If you take out the party and the clique, the first thing that needs to be resisted is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From your friend requests on Facebook, to your snarky posts, to your attempts to share the alleged location of my home and my father's name on social media, I've chosen not to engage.
Afterwards, you continued to tag me persistently at the frequency of six meals a day, and even continued to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscene and humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, body shape, good living habits, strawberries on the bed, whether to insert or not, I... It's enough.
How would I know that later, I received many messages from friends telling me that there was a photo of me and sexually harassing remarks on your Facebook friend’s account.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't shut up anymore.
After the news of my report was posted, you became more and more arrogant.

Yeah, you can keep going with the snarky, cynical, belittling, bullying comments, you can keep claiming you're just concerned and caring, you can keep saying that's not harassment, you can keep denying that you drew it or you can keep spewing hateful rhetoric.
That's right, I can't and I won't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and my face and body certainly don't need your comments.
I don't even think there's a girl out there who would willingly allow herself to be humiliated in that way for fame.
How you doing?
I said you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think there's a single girl out there who wouldn't feel violated after something like that.
Whether in the workplace, in society, in politics or business, it is only those who have no basic decency who will choose to use this way to injure any woman.
I believe that justice will prevail.
I will translate some of the comments for everyone to see
Shouldn't it be impossible for anyone to impersonate you on your own feed?
All I can say is that you are an enemy of civilization
Smile to yourself

It's not much to write home about. There are hardly any hardware stores or restaurants, and the restaurant food is nothing to write home about.
This elevator is also very funny. It is just like a person with a serious illness. It goes down by -2 to -1 and up by -1 to 0. It goes back and forth. I pressed this floor. I went down from the safety corridor to the first floor. It is also very funny. It goes directly to a furniture store. The furniture store is closed. It is impossible to go out from the safety corridor!
It needs to be upgraded. There are a lot of places that have not been developed.

The Yangtze River reaches full coverage of water-based green integrated service areas - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (reported by Wang Xian) - The Chongqing Fuling Water-based Green Integrated Service Area was built and put into operation on the 10th day of December as scheduled. This is the second water-based green integrated service area in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Lanzhou Water-based Green Integrated Service Area in Sichuan, which was put into operation on the 8th day of December.
Up to now, the water green integrated service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qi Jianghua, Deputy Director of the Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, said that previously, 10 water-based green integrated service areas have been built and operated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors, and have played an important role in promoting high-quality development of the Yangtze River shipping industry.
The coverage of water-based green integrated service areas is another milestone in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River. The reception of pollutants of Yangtze River ships and the capacity of shipping services have been significantly enhanced.
It is reported that the water-based green integrated service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services for the large number of ships and crew, and it can help the large number of crew to solve the problems of "urgent, difficult, worries and expectations".
This time, two water-based green integrated service areas on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River were built and put into operation. It is a comprehensive service area integrating life, production, and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship maintenance and emergency rescue services as the highlights. It will enable the ships in the port to enjoy “one docking and multiple services”, which will make the work and life of the sailors sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and convenient all year round.
zh:Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China; the most powerful weapon of the U.S. Navy seldom visits Guam; the latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China; the U.S. media also reveals that the most powerful weapon of the U.S. Navy, the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, seldom visits Guam, which sends an important signal to the U.S. allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
The South China Strategic Sensing Platform, a Chinese think tank, reported on January 9 that a satellite found the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the vicinity of the Strait of Malacca.
The Malacca Strait links the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the First Island Chain of the West Pacific.
The platform is expected to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the F-35C fighter aircraft and the CMV-22 "Osprey" ship-based transport aircraft are deployed on the "USS Carl Vinson".
The U.S. Navy aircraft carriers now roaming the Pacific are not only the USS Carl Vinson, but also the USS Abraham Lincoln, which had set out from the U.S. on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the first F-35C carrier air group, which belonged to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy has also deployed the USS Ronald Reagan, which is berthed in Yokosuka, Japan, in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Hainan Lake" frigate and the "Stockdale" destroyer.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers gathered in the vicinity of China. The most powerful weapon rarely visited Guam. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite image. It showed that the three U.S. aircraft carriers gathered in the vicinity of China.
(Weibo @South China Strategic Sensing) Three U.S. aircraft carriers gathered in the vicinity of China. The most powerful weapon visited Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the U.S. transport aircraft CMV-22B.
（Weibo @South China Strategic Sensing） According to the report of CNN on January 17, the most powerful weapon in the US Navy Weapons Depot was seldom visited to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, which carried 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China. The most powerful weapon is seldom visited to Guam. It is analyzed that this is a signal to the friend and enemy of the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016, and the second time it has been openly visited by Guam since the 1980s.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers gathered in the vicinity of China. The most powerful weapon rarely visited Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
This is the view of Wanshou Island, part of the Nansha Islands in China.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada enhanced the cooperation between the U.S. and its allies in the region during its visit to Guam, demonstrated the U.S. capabilities, flexibility, deployment readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Submarines propelled by ballistic missiles are often called "boomers".
The whereabouts of the 14 "Seawolf" submarines in the U.S. Navy are usually kept strictly confidential.
Around the ballistic missile submarine, the "Lyon submarine" has become the "most important survival weapon" of the "nuclear triad", which also includes the launching tube ballistic missile in the United States and the B-2 and B-52 bombers that can carry nuclear warheads.
What did Zuckerberg say in response to the 26% drop in Meta and a loss of $251 billion in market value?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its income mainly comes from advertisements. Today, the advertising company that makes money is itself a traffic channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on are all traffic channels of Meta, no matter what kind of functional positioning.
In addition, Meta is the largest "advertising alliance". Many apps are connected to Meta's advertisements, and the monetization is achieved through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, Apple’s privacy policy adjustment makes it difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users. It will obviously remind users whether to allow the App to obtain their information. Most people's normal reactions are certainly not to allow it.
Next, if Google stabs one more time, it will have a greater impact on Meta's income.
Second, the China factor in Meta's previous income growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it definitely exists).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual income comes from China, which is mainly contributed by the overseas business companies in China.
There are about a few hundred people in Meta's office in Hong Kong, and several agents in Mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand into overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel. Most of the money spent went to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's major competitors, but two years ago, it made a lot of money from Byte.
All the agents in China are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and the performance of Meta in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but I'm sure it's not better than before.
The era of massive spending by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms, including TT, are no longer in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not only at current income, but also at the prospects for the future.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were too low.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about “Metaverse”.
While the metaverse is definitely a trend for the future, the realization of the metaverse will take a long time. This story will not be enough to support Meta’s market value in the next two or three years.
So in the next two years, it will be a very difficult period for Meta.
While Facebook is in the spotlight now and makes $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue every year, in fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no safe moat.
Although his several social software have relatively high daily activity and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., he has no confidence to face the rapid development of TikTok. The revolution between them is just a blink of an eye.
The concept of metaverse is an unattainable concept in the near future. Therefore, there is no hope for success in a short period of time. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and continued to find new tracks. However, I think his track selection is wrong.
