Shouting at the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland is considered to have gotten off to a good start, and the calls to action heard in the wilderness are starting to pull in people from all over the world.
“You need Iceland, I need Iceland," says a woman in a comment on a YouTube advertisement for the campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland.
Another spectator says that he will keep Iceland in his heart forever and a young woman says that she has to come to Iceland as soon as possible because her boyfriend lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States, so she will have to wait for a few more months.
Another spectator asks whether the path to Iceland is open, since there are no planes.
It is not known whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson from the advertising agency Peel, who worked on the ads together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the response has been beyond expectations.
“I have been involved in many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already breaking records.
At its core, it's about creating PR value, which is getting foreign media to talk about the campaign, and it's gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in over 700 media outlets around the world, reaching more than two billion people.
The value of the coverage is estimated at ISK 1.8 billion.
It's not bad."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has been going very well there, despite the fact that the United States is not on its way to Iceland at the moment.
According to Egill, known markets such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also taken well to themselves, as has Russia, which comes as a pleasant surprise.
There were responses from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically targeted.
“These ads have traveled further than we expected,” says Egill, and it should be noted that more than four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better start.”
The pictures here were taken by Árni Sæberg, a photographer for Morgunblaðið, during the shooting of advertisements with the slogan „Let It Out“ in the middle of last month.
Filming took place in various locations, including Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, Reynisfjara, Skógafoss, Sólheimajökull and a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cameraman was Óttar Guðnason.
The Icelandic actress Anna Jia and the Cuban-American Murphy Cardenas, who is from Hungary, were in the roles.
Hundreds of Icelanders were involved in the making of the advertisements, at the same time as filming took place in South Iceland, another group was filming in West Iceland and the Westfjords.
According to Egill, "Let It Out" is only the first phase of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, with a winter campaign planned in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
„This is just the first phase of this work for Icelandic Tourist Board,“ says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone very well.
„Það er frábært að vinna með þeim.
In projects like this, it is crucial to have a foreign partner with knowledge of the markets we are talking about."
Sprengisandur: Talk about the situation on the labor market, pension funds and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Iceland's Minister of Social Affairs and Children, will appear on Sprengisandur at 10:00 on Bylgjan today.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the situation on the labour market, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also talks about regional issues and the transfer of jobs out to the countryside, which has gone badly and been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the president of VR, will also appear in the show. He will discuss his criticism of pension funds' investments and will present his ideas on how the labour movement and employers should withdraw from the boards of the pension funds in order to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then, we will talk to Ivar Ingimarsson, a tourism entrepreneur in Austurland, and Árnheiður Jóhannsdóttir, CEO of the Markaðsstofu Norðurlands, about the situation in tourism in the countryside.
They will look ahead to the autumn and wonder whether the success of the summer is an omen of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, starting at 10:00.
This is how she looks today, 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teen-oriented television.
However, she achieved worldwide fame for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also appeared in Sabrina, the Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills, 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has been heard of her recently, but she was persuaded to look back over her career and talk about Clueless on Australian television recently.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, and says she was a wonderful person.
„I have to admit that I based the character mostly on girls I met in school who weren't nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said about his role in Clueless.
Did not want to leave the police station after an overnight stay
Fifty crimes were reported to the police in the greater Reykjavík area today, and according to the police log, the crimes were varied.
The day at the Hverfisgata police station started with the police having to deal with a man who had recently been released from a holding cell after being detained for drunk driving.
Did the man not want to leave after he was released and did not follow the police instructions to leave.
Did the man's continued presence at the police station earn him that privilege?
In the morning, a man was arrested on suspicion of burglary at a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to intervene in two men in Breiðholt due to a report of a physical assault.
It also came to light that a woman who was eating in a shopping mall in Kópavogur was unable to pay for her bill at the end of the meal and was subsequently called by the police.
A car was also stolen in the city centre in the morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked for her for a moment and took her by force.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Pink Panther - The Terrible Fate of the Pink Panther
The theory that a curse has been placed on the "Glee" series has taken flight on the Internet, after the show's star Naya Rivera drowned in California earlier this month, making her the third main cast member to die prematurely.
The Glee series is a popular TV series about singing, dancing and joy.
The series dealt with the so-called joy band of high school students, their loves and their fate.
It wasn't always a bed of roses to be a part of the band, but through singing and dancing, the characters on the show seemed to be able to overcome whatever obstacles came their way.
Outside of the set, major tragedies have befallen the cast and crew of the show, so much so that rumors have begun to circulate that the show is cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez, a cheerleader who wasn't afraid to speak her mind.
Eftir að þáttaröðin hafði runnið sitt skeið gekk Rivera að eiga leikarann Ryan Dorsey og átti með honum sitt fyrsta og eina barn, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they subsequently separated.
Dorsey, however, refused to press charges and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was reported that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found asleep in a life jacket aboard the boat and was able to tell authorities that he and his mother had gone swimming and that Rivera had come back to get him but never returned.
An extensive search was launched for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the area's police chief announced that they were assuming Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially declared dead.
It is believed that she was caught in a strong current in the water and used her last breath to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded as accidental drowning.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson, the American football player with the angelic voice who brought Glee to prominence.
Outside of the show, Moneith was struggling with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and it was difficult to get away from it.
In 2013, his co-workers on the show stepped in and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed to be on the road to recovery.
Just two months after completing treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to party with friends.
The cause of death was a lethal combination of drugs and alcohol.
It was not considered to be a deliberate act.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for drugs had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death hit his co-stars hard, but with the help of his on-screen love interest, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue the show, dedicating an entire episode to his memory and his character, Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow Glee Club members, until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of possession of child pornography.
During a search at his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and the case soon became public.
It was clear that Salling was finished.
He was subsequently indicted and convicted of his crimes.
He was facing up to four to seven years in prison, as well as having to register as a sex offender and seek treatment for pedophilia.
Before the judge had ruled on the sentence, Salling, who was out on bail at the time, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
Not only did the cast of the show die young, but so did many of the show's writers.
Jim Fuller was the co-executive producer of the show.
He died in his sleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
Another woman, named Nancy Motes, also worked on the show.
She was the younger sister of Hollywood starlet Julia Roberts and didn't have a good story to tell about her sister, accusing her of being controlling and abusive.
Motes took her own life in 2014, after struggling with severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her fiancé in which she blamed her mother and sisters for what had happened to her.
My mother and so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory of how they caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and harassing her co-stars on set and having an over-the-top ego.
Jesse Luken guest starred in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a huge scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
She was victimized in 2010 when hackers broke into her computer and posted nude photos of her online.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the series and were in a relationship outside of the series.
Later, Benoist said that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything
It increases children's development when they are allowed to play outside in the garden with their parents, planting flowers and watching them grow.
It is also endless what you can do with flowers, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just spending time with the kids in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the smell and of course the precious time they got to spend with their parents.
Keypti sér bát eftir tíunda bekk
“I don't think there are many fishermen working in preschools across the country," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who works as a fisherman in the summer and is studying psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter."
Strandveiðarnar eru mjög þægilegt sumarstarf þegar maður er í námi.
If you fish well, you can make good money and I think it's great that I don't have to take out student loans.
The income is enough for me to get through the winter as well," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, 25-year-old psychology student, who has been engaged in beach fishing for the past few summers.
Axel had just docked at Tálknafjörður when a reporter caught up with him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
When I was in tenth grade, I took my captain's license for boats under twelve meters and I bought my boat the summer after I finished high school.
I have fished for lobster off my boat every summer since then.
I bought the boat from a friend of mine, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after him.
Hartmann was an adult when I bought the boat and was no longer at sea, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat was named after him.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, who bought the boat for three million crowns.
I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half of it, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I was finished fishing.
At the end of that first summer I owned the boat debt-free."
But how could a boy have $150,000 to pay off a boat when he had just graduated from high school?
„I had been saving up and collecting money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was out fishing with him every summer and I got my share.
I also put my confirmation money into my boat fund."
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his mother's family is from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
“I can fish here in the Westfjords because I have a residence permit with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I learned about these areas here in the west from rowing with my dad.
I move between fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all of West Iceland.
Although I prefer to fish in the west, I have also fished around Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
I've also fished in the south, mostly lobster, but," says Axel, who always goes out fishing early in the morning and sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, alone, for hours on the open sea.
The internet connection at sea is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't mind being on my own.
Of course I try to avoid accidents, but occasionally something has happened, but never any real danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishing is going at the time.
“In the pelagic fishery, I am never more than 14 hours at sea at a time, but I have also been fishing in other quota systems, for example in the leased quota, but then I have been out at sea for up to 1.5 days at a time fishing.”
He says the quota system for coastal fishing is such that he is allowed to catch 770 kilograms a day, which he finds restrictive.
Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish for twelve days a month, these four months that coastal fishing is open, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to row instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and being able to row as they see fit.
So, too, could the regional division go as well for me, and fishing ports that are well-situated for fishing should be able to benefit from that," says Axel, who mainly catches salted cod from the sea on his coastal fishing trips, but also occasionally catches some pollock and other species.
Axel works over the winter with his university studies at Núpi kindergarten in Kópavogur.
“I don't think there are many sailors who work in kindergartens in the country," says Axel proudly, adding that he had only planned to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
„I got stuck there because I love my job so much.
I hope that the psychology degree will be useful to me on the pre-school level in the future," says Axel, who is also studying business administration.
Villa in registration prevents homecoming quarantine
The villa in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country led to an individual, living in Iceland, not being called back for a retest.
There is no requirement to enter a national identity number if the form is filled out in English, as is the case when it is filled out in Icelandic.
“This will be looked at this week,” says a specialist in infectious diseases at the Landlæknisembættið.
Three domestic cases were detected at the virology department of Landspítalinn yesterday.
One of them tested positive after arriving in the country on July 15, two days after the so-called home quarantine rules came into effect.
Those who are resident in Iceland are then screened on arrival in the country and again called in for testing four to five days later.
According to RÚV's midday news, the person in question went by the old system.
The screening at the border was negative and he was not called back for a follow-up test for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in infectious diseases at the Landlæknisembætti, says in an interview with RÚV that this is due to a mistake in the electronic registration form.
Fill out the registration form in English is not a requirement to enter a national identity number, as it is in the Icelandic version.
After all, it was primarily aimed at foreign tourists.
Hence, the individual did not receive an automatic invitation to come in for a test.
Kamilla says that many have followed the quarantine rules even though they have filled out the English registration form and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people back for testing after they have arrived in the country.
“This will be looked at in the coming week to see how we can make it easier for people to access this and raise awareness of the process.”
The man is in isolation and six people have been placed in quarantine.
All of them will be tested, but two of them were already showing symptoms.
Contact tracing is ongoing for the three cases identified yesterday, but is largely complete for the two cases identified on Friday.
In both cases, the genetic sequencing of the Icelandic Genetics has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the bonds have been directed at Israel, even though it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be clear tomorrow where the other virus is coming from.
Alls eru nú 15 í einangrun samkvæmt vefnum COVID.is.
135 are in isolation.
Four of the five infections are unrelated
Five domestic cases have been reported in Iceland over the past few days.
Four of them are completely unrelated and, for example, the source of the infection that broke out at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday has not yet been found.
Smitrakning is still ongoing.
Originally, 30 exceptionally sent individuals were placed in quarantine, but their number was reduced to 16.
In total, 34 people are in isolation due to these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that an infection has been detected at a sporting event, and this has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications officer at the National Police and Security Agency, says it is possible, as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
We are constantly reminding everyone who lives here that they need to keep up with their individual hygiene measures.
We also need to remind people who are organising events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
Then you can hold events," says Jóhann.
He says that it is possible to prevent the spread of infection by maintaining individual hygiene measures.
Rules and guidelines are also subject to constant review.
What needs to be done, and what Almannavarnardeildin and embætti landlæknis are constantly reminding people of, is to focus on these individual hygiene measures.
Both at home and also at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use hand sanitizer.
It prevents the spread of infection," says Jóhann.
“We need to remind people that we are on a good path and that we need to continue that path in order to maintain the success that we have had so far.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had type 2 diabetes
Devon Brumfield heyrði í gegnum símann hversu erfitt faðir hennar átti með að ná andanum.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was killed.
The death was attributed to sudden respiratory failure due to a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed as a contributing factor on the death certificate and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same thing could happen to him.
The Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
The figures from a new study commissioned by US authorities show that nearly 40% of those who died were suffering from type 2 diabetes as an underlying condition.
When the proportion of those under the age of 65 is considered, the proportion rises to half.
A study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) looked at more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in infectious diseases at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
A poll of 12 countries carried out by Reuters showed a similar trend.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Colombia, have not yet reported underlying illnesses.
Diabetes was already an epidemic in slow motion.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful tsunami," has Reuters quoted Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among black and Hispanic people, who have also been hit harder by the coronavirus.
The best defense for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease in check with exercise, a healthy diet, and the help of health care professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
The high price of insulin has forced some to continue to go to work, putting them at risk of exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that U.S. authorities should have been aware of the danger posed to people with type 2 diabetes by the virus.
When the SARS coronavirus spread in 2003, more than 20% of those affected were hospitalized, and in the 2009 swine flu pandemic, this group was three times more likely to be hospitalized.
When MERS emerged in 2012, one study found that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of COVID-19 may last longer, the pandemic has lifted the veil on a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’re going to see a tsunami of problems when this is over,” says Andrew Bolton, president of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could indirectly lead to an increase in complications associated with diabetes, such as kidney disease.
One new study suggests that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in the number of cases of diabetes.
Scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes, according to Reuters.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs already weakened by diabetes in many people.
Then, a high proportion of glucose and lipids among diabetics can trigger a true "immune storm," as it is called, when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
„Þetta er allt eitt stórt púsluspil,“ segir Dela Cruz.
“It’s all interconnected.”

“We were offered champagne and then they left the room”
The couple, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason, accepted the unusual offer from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was setting up in Paris.
“We loved each other so much that it wasn’t complicated.”
Atli Bollason never forgets the moment he met his wife, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
„Ég varð mjög heillaður af henni.
Of course, it was just the glow, but I also thought it was incredibly cute.
And that's still the case," he says.
Asrún remembers this too, since her husband often reminds her of their first meeting.
„Ég er alltaf að heyra þessa sögu.
Just over the weekend," she says, who was also attracted to her husband at first sight.
„I felt and still feel a lot of hype around Atli, which I like.
There is a lot going on and a lot happening, and I was fascinated by it."
Atli segir þau hjónin hafa lagt áherslu á það í sambandi sínu að fara sínar eigin leiðir.
We do not tie up our baggage in the same way as our fellow travellers.
We avoid routines that we identify around us."
Maybe that's why they took the Ragnar Kjartansson artist's proposal with such enthusiasm, even though it was quite unusual.
Kristín Anna, a mutual friend of ours, contacts us and asks if we can join her, Ragga and Ingibjörg, Ragnar's wife, for dessert at Snaps.
They accepted the invitation, met the three amigos on Snapchat and had desert wine and their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar as he led them through his plans for an art exhibition he intended to set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris this autumn.
He had a multi-screen video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it simply."
Ásrún says he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and the last thing he said to us was that he wanted to know if we were interested in being a part of it.”
Senan that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was meant to show a young middle-class couple falling in love in a minimalist apartment.
„Þetta er samfarir frá upphafi til enda,“ segir Atli.
The couple did not know Ragnar well, although they knew of him and he of them, "but they knew us and thought we would fit in.
They said they didn't want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people but people who would get sexual gratification from performing for others."
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
When we walked out of Snaps, we said: Aren't we just going to do this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his whole team," says Ásrún, and Atli agrees.
“It’s about love and intimacy”
Senan was recorded in a fine apartment on Mýrargatan.
There was a very small film crew there; the cameraman, Ragnar, sound man and the couple.
After the recording started, everyone left the room to wait in the car, except Atli and Ásrún.
„We hadn't decided anything about how we were going to be.
We got some small instructions, but we tried to forget time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no acting, we just loved each other so it was easy," says Ásrún.
Was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a bit romantic,” says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.
We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on holiday in a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was impressed with the couple's performance in the piece that moved them.
“When Tommi, the cameraman, saw this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful,” says Atli.
It's just as much about love and intimacy as the actual sex, says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice of her son at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
„Þá snýr hún sér við og fer að pæla í þessu,“ segir Atli.
Mamma og pabbi sáu þetta í París.
We didn't tell anyone this, but then my dad just sent me a message and said: It was nice to see the little family in the Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.
And participation in the work has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
„At least we are still together, so maybe it deepened something.
At least it deepened my relationship with my in-laws," says Ásrún and laughs.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
„It was a bit difficult not to be with you, but with someone else,“ she says, turning to her husband.
„En það var gaman að sjá þetta því þetta er bara ein sena í miklu stærra verki og þegar maður sá þetta með hinum verkunum er þetta mjög flott.
Ég gat aðeins slakað aðeins á og var bara stolt.
And there was a little bun in my belly," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scene was filmed.
„Þetta var bara fallegt.“
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Ásrún and Atli in Love Stories on Rás 1.
Swansea won the first leg of the semi-finals.
Swansea won a 1-0 victory over Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first match between the two teams in the semi-finals of the play-offs for promotion to the English Premier League.
The game was played at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The score at half-time was 0–0.
The home side Swansea were awarded a penalty on the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew failed to score from the penalty spot and the ball was saved.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, received a red card.
Brentford spilaði því restina af leiknum manni færri og á 82. mínútu nýttu leikmenn Swansea sér liðsmuninn.
Andre Ayew made up for his penalty miss by scoring a great goal and securing Swansea a 1-0 victory.
Swansea lead the tie 1-0 after the first leg, with the second leg taking place next Wednesday at home to Brentford.
No ambassador for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the US ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted to hire an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.
However, it has not always been easy for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador to Iceland.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as US ambassador in April 2009, the country has been without an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned from her post in unusual circumstances, Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Order of the Falcon.
While on her way to a farewell ceremony with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the Presidential Office informing her that she would not be awarded the title.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at the U.S. Army War College.
Sixteen months later, in September 2010, Van Voorst's successor was appointed.
This can partly be attributed to the fact that Robert S. Connan was appointed as ambassador but then withdrew.
Finally, Louis Ariega took over, having worked in the foreign service for over a decade.
He resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
This was followed by another period of ambassadorial vacancies.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015 and took up his post shortly afterwards, having been the first ambassador to the country for 13 months.
Barber was not a diplomat, but a political appointee who had worked as a lawyer for Barack Obama's campaign.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office as president on January 20, 2017, as is customary for political ambassadors.
Trump's administration was unusually long in appointing both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the federal government in Washington.
It took two years for the United States Congress to call Jeffrey Ross Gunter to a hearing to ask him questions and confirm him as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony before the court, he stated that he had never been to Iceland, but had often been to Western Europe, but his wife, who is deceased, was of Dutch descent.
Gunter is a political appointee, having previously been a dermatologist in California and a prominent figure in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the group, and Adelson is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, after no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest period without an ambassador in Iceland.
The reason is both the length of time that the Trump administration was taking to nominate people to key posts, as well as the fact that, over the past few years, the work of the U.S. Congress has dragged on, including the confirmation of ambassadors.
Since 2009, Iceland has been without an ambassador for a total of five years.
This, however, has not prevented the embassy from carrying out its projects, which recently opened its headquarters at Engjateigur.
The construction is said to have cost around 6.5 billion euros, and the building is surrounded by bulletproof walls and bulletproof glass in all the windows.
However, it does not seem to have been enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security, as he is said to fear for his life and has requested armed bodyguards.
A former ÍBV player was subjected to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former player for ÍBV, says he experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This comes from an interview with Tonny, which was published by the Ugandan media outlet Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, who play in the top division in Uganda.
In an interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland, where he played for ÍBV, Valur and Þróttur.
„When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle like I was used to.
The captain of the team was in that position, and he was also wearing the jersey number that I wanted, so I didn't get either of the things that I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right wing with ÍBV this season.
Tonny talks about racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
It's happened to me once, but because I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard about the case and then I asked my friend what the case was about.
He told me that my opponent had made racist comments about me after I tackled him."
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
There, he says he made the mistakes he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to break into the starting line-up at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
He then asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he then went to Valur.
It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had stayed longer in Norway, I would have got the chance I wanted," says Tonny, who hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would go further.
He claims that the loan to Iceland put an end to his dreams of playing for a big club in Europe.
A worm was found in the throat of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 inch long black worm in the woman's throat.
Surgeons were able to remove the worm with forceps.
An investigation revealed that it was a parasite.
CNN reports this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which are thin slices of raw meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, the number of cases where parasites have been transmitted to humans has increased since sushi became popular in the West.
Fear that a second wave is about to start in Europe
Spain is now in the spotlight in relation to concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where governments have taken action to curb the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.
In Catalonia, all leisure activities have been suspended for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action in response to the increase in cases in Spain, with the UK requiring all arrivals from Spain to go into self-isolation, like in Norway, and the French being warned against travelling to Spain.
The number of cases is also rising again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between containing the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
The situation in Europe is still good compared to the rest of the world, but the number of new infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 a day, with the most infections in America and South Asia.
The number of confirmed cases worldwide has reached 16 million, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, and the death toll from the virus has risen to 644,000.
Gerð's mosaic work finally gets the recognition it deserves
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavík there is a large and deep hole.
Above them are men wearing orange helmets.
There is also a large grave there.
And smaller pieces of machinery.
The road is closed to traffic.
The pavement is passable, and now many stop to admire the mosaic artwork — as if they've never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At the very least, he has not considered it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it were parking spaces that were always occupied.
People parked there, locked their cars in a hurry and then ran off to take care of their business in the city centre.
“Vibrant and diverse public spaces” and “a welcoming cityscape” are the guiding principles for the redevelopment of Tryggvagata, which is currently underway.
The aim is to beautify the area and allow Gerðar Helgadóttir's mosaic at the Customs House to be seen better.
In front of the work there will be a square, and since the area is well exposed to the sun, it is considered suitable as a resting area for pedestrians.
The artwork will be illuminated and the material will now be better displayed on this 142 square metre surface.
There will also be small "mist jets," or water sculptures, that offer play and a certain mystique to the area.
The works are described by Reykjavíkurborg, which is carrying out the works in cooperation with Veitur.
Water, heating and electricity pipes will be renewed.
Many of them are over 100 years old, but the sewage and cold water mains are from 1925 and have served the city centre for almost a century.
When the road is reopened after the works have been completed, cars will be able to drive along it again.
However, it will be a one-way street and at the same time, it will create a calmer and more accessible space for pedestrians.
According to information about the Customs House on the Customs Director's website, the building was opened in 1971, and the architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because the harbour warehouse extended through the house, there was a 250 square metre windowless wall facing the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a plaza would have a detrimental effect on the overall appearance of the street, unless special measures were taken to enhance the appearance of the building.
The parties agreed that it would be reasonable to assume that a permanent work of art would be installed there.
At this time, Gerður Helgadóttir, visual artist, was much talked about, says the summary.
She had worked a lot on mosaic art in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether or not to hold a competition for the work.
It had often been said that the work needed to reflect life at the docks, as the docks had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since they were built.
When talking to the artist, she became so fascinated by such a work.
She had to agree that she would get drawings and other assistance before she left the country again, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður was given the time she felt she needed, and when she returned home she put forward a few proposals for discussion.
It was immediately decided to ask her to do the work.
In addition, it was requested that a comprehensive contract be made with her and the famous German art restoration company, the Oidtmann brothers, as Gerður had worked with them for a long time in the restoration of famous works of art all over Europe.
Agreement was reached and Gerður completed the artwork in the workshop of the brothers, who then took care of the installation in the Customs House.
The entire work was carried out exceptionally well, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, according to the summary.
It has withstood the harsh Icelandic weather ever since.
It took Gerði about two years to complete the work, which was created and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Toll House was completed, at the age of 47.
Preparing the transfer of more institutions to the countryside
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, the Minister of Social Affairs, announced that more public institutions will be moved to the countryside in the near future.
The minister said this in the Sprengisandur program on Bylgjan in the afternoon.
Recently, it was announced that the Fire Safety Department of the Housing and Building Agency will be moved to Sauðárkrók in the autumn.
There are fire safety specialists working at the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency north, and the Fire Brigade Union has criticized the relocation.
„Ég held að við eigum að stíga frekari skref í þessa veruna.
I am preparing to take further steps in this matter.
Further transportation," said Ásmundur.
He says he is convinced that a large majority of the population wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
„I think more political decisions need to be made about moving public jobs out to the countryside, like I did with the Housing and Construction Agency,“ said Ásmundur, who also took the example of other institutions that have been moved out to the countryside, such as the relocation of the Food and Veterinary Authority to Selfoss, Land Surveying Iceland to Akranes, and unemployment benefits to Skagaströnd.
All the latest news from the second day of the World Championships
The Icelandic championships in track and field came to an end at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri today.
Some records were broken on the second day of competition.
It was expected to be an exciting competition in women's javelin throw at Þórsvöllur, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic record in javelin throw in 2014, which stood until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR broke the record in May last year.
Vigdís regained the national record earlier this summer and has been in great form recently, having improved the national record three times so far this summer.
Elísabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and was not at her best today.
She had only one valid throw of five, throwing 25.69 metres, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the farthest today, 60.08 meters in her last attempt, and set a new tournament record.
Her national record she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters and she was far from that.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day. She improved her personal best with a throw of 50.18 metres.
In the men's competition, FH's Hilmar Örn Jónsson, who is the national record holder in the discus throw, won the competition with an easy victory. He threw 73.84 meters in his second-to-last throw and set a new competition record.
His national record in the event is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympic athlete and Icelandic champion in discus throw, won a competition in shot put at Þórsvöllur yesterday, but today he competed in discus throw, which is his main discipline.
Guðni Valur's Icelandic record is 65.53 metres, but he threw the furthest today, 59.13 metres, to secure the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest throw of the day, with one valid throw of 49.43 meters, good enough for second place.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Icelandic champion in long jump, won the long jump competition with an outstanding performance. Hafdís jumped 6.25 meters today, which is almost 40 cm from her national record.
In the women's 200m, it was ÍR's Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, crossing the line in 24.04 seconds. Her national record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri as she won two gold medals yesterday in the 100 metre run and in the 4 x 100 metre relay, and today in the 4 x 400 metre relay.
In the men's competition, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first to cross the finish line in the 200-meter run in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Máni Samúelsson from Ármann.
Just like Guðbjörg Jóna won gold in the 100m yesterday, Kolbeinn Höður also won gold in the 400m.
Does not receive a fine for 27 million króna Bitcoin harvest
The Tax Appeal Board has rejected a claim by the tax prosecutor who demanded a fine be imposed on a man for under-reporting his capital gains from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The committee comes to the conclusion that the tax prosecutor did not present clear arguments as to why it was necessary to fine the man.
In the ruling of the committee, it is stated that the tax inspector considered the man to have fulfilled the formal requirements of the tax returns for the years 2016 and 2017.
He had under-declared his capital gains from the sale of cryptocurrency Bitcoin worth 27 million euros, either wilfully or through gross negligence.
The man would be fined for his actions.
The man denied this in a letter to the committee.
However, he did admit to selling $2.7 million worth of cryptocurrency in 2016.
Hana he would have obtained by means of grafting in the years 2009 and 2010, when it was both easy and inexpensive with a normal home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the tax treatment for such a sale was very unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been difficult to expect ordinary taxpayers to be aware of such arrangements on their tax returns.
He had not intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and had declared his ownership of the account as an asset on his tax return.
He had contacted both experts and the tax authorities to find out how this worked, but without success.
Therefore, he believed that it was necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
Therefore, he would have been in a worse position than others to understand complex rules that the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion on.
The man therefore considered it appropriate that his taxes for these two income years would be recalculated and a penalty imposed, but otherwise no punishment.
He also reiterated that he works in Iceland and has paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to evade his responsibilities in an improper manner.
The demand for a fine would be out of all proportion and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur raises eyebrows: "This guy knows what football is all about"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been a bit of a lightning rod this season, drawing both praise and criticism for his play with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max-deildinni.
Breiðablik will be in the spotlight tonight when they take on ÍA in a live broadcast on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is suspended for four yellow cards during the season and will therefore not play with a new haircut as he has done in the games so far this summer.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his forehead before the match against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
„I don't know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but talking about character, this guy was really trying in the game.
He did not hide.
He wants the ball every time and if someone was going to equalize the game, I thought he was going to do it or create it," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in Pepsi Max stand, when asked about Brynjólfur.
“I’m supposed to be here for the people.”
„Sometimes it's hard to figure out what position he's in.
He looks a little bit to the left as the game goes on, but he has a very free role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson says that Brynjólfur is a real entertainer and he is happy to have such a colorful man in the team: "There is no doubt that this is a character.
This is a fun character and I love the hair, and being ready for interviews all the time.
It's amazing how many people are obsessed with him, which tells me that this guy knows what football is all about.
„Ég er skemmtikraftur.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and have fun with it."
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólfur, people are paying to get in and watch what's next on his head.
This guy is just a genius," said Máni.
A KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with a few teams in the B-deild"
KR-leikmaðurinn Tobias Thomsen virðist vera á förum frá félaginu.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Fótbolti.net also reported on the case.
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country, but first he has to terminate his contract with KR, as the Danish league starts before the Icelandic one.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias told Bold.
I have been in contact with a couple of teams in the B-Division and will probably move before the end of the Icelandic season.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay off my contract with KR."
He then says that he will probably have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
“Organizations in Denmark have probably felt the economic effects of the virus more than in Iceland.“
The bike thief Bjartmar has recovered bikes for millions - now he's responding to DV
For the past year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby that is different from most others.
He sniffs out and recovers lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the nickname "bike whisperer" as a result.
Yesterday there was quite a stir when a man posted a story about his interactions with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to discussions on the Facebook group of Vesturbæingar, where it was stated that Bjartmar had spoken to the man on Austurvelli and said that the scooter might have been stolen.
Wasn't it possible to infer from the original writings of the electric scooter man that Bjartmar had stolen him?
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV article has been updated to reflect that.
Bjartmar says the original reports of the incident do not accurately reflect what actually happened yesterday on Austurvelli.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victim of the electric scooter attack that these were, in fact, his electric scooters.
The alleged owner received the information from someone else, but the information turned out to be false, says Bjartmar.
„I saw the guy and I recognized the scooter, because I had information that this was a scooter that had been missing for a long time and was being searched for.
I hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to drive off in the taxi, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was convinced of his guilt, so I decided to have a talk with the man.
In general, I go very well in such cases, but before I could finish what I wanted to say, the man had taken the word out of my mouth."
Bjartmar says that the man in the electric scooter offered to show him the receipt for the bicycle and called the police himself.
„Já, flott,“ sagði Bjartmar, „fáum þetta bara á hreint.“
The owner of the e-scooter then proved ownership of the e-scooter and drove off.
Later, the rightful owner of the electric scooter told his story on Facebook, as previously reported.
In the short time that Bjartmar has been practicing this, he says he can count on one hand the number of times he has gotten into trouble with people.
„I have been in peaceful negotiations with the toughest men in Reykjavík,“ Bjartmar said, pointing out that bicycle thieves are usually the smallest brothers and sisters of society, drug addicts, mentally handicapped people and other people who end up on the street for some reason.
The addiction is a hard-nosed landlord, and somehow the next dose has to be financed, unfortunately theft is an easy way to achieve that goal, says Bjartmar.
My relationship with this group of people is so good that I've managed to bring a lot of the good people with me.
There are examples of people going through treatment and getting their act together and coming to me for help with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar's interactions with cyclists are courteous.
Some know of him and what he's doing and offer to show him receipts, bike numbers and so on.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has received little attention.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even going so far as to tell people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous reporting of DV and says that he is not some kind of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked whether he is not, after all, on thin ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar replies that this is indeed the case.
Of course the police should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are not doing this.
For example, I have seen police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen bicycles.
She is absolutely useless when it comes to these matters."
“When the police are not doing anything about it, and this is right in front of your face, and the experience has shown that I have been able to achieve results in this field, then why not?” Bjartmar asks.
Hann claims to have achieved such a high level of success in recovering stolen bicycles that he sometimes runs into his "clients" on the street, only to find that they've just given Bjartmar the bikes they had previously stolen.
In the cases where Bjartmar has called the police for help, they have actually failed to show up.
„It’s not working with the police, and it’s not my fault and it’s not the bike owners’ fault,“ said Bjartmar, who is disappointed that victims of bike theft have to suffer because of the police’s inaction in this area.
There is no disagreement about Bjartmar's success.
There are many stories of people thanking Bjartmar for getting their possessions back to them.
According to Bjartmar himself, he has long since lost count of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts run into millions, if not tens of millions.
Vega there electric bicycles, electric scooters and electric tricycles, which are heavy, but electric bicycles can cost up to half a million.
During the day, Bjartmar works at a daycare center, and every other weekend he works at a shelter.
His bicycle search is therefore unpaid work he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a significant year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had been receiving pensions from the Danish King since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for civil servants was established, which eventually became a pension fund for all public servants.
The basis for the current pension system for ordinary wage earners was laid with the general collective agreements on the labour market in 1969, whereby provisions were made for occupational pension schemes with compulsory membership and full pension accrual from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were passed on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to grow after that.
The pension system for wage earners was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century won through its struggle for wages.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a famous strike in 1955 in a similar way, and the organization also gradually achieved its demands for sick leave and pension funds, significant holiday rights, shorter working hours, improvements in housing and other matters that mattered a lot.
All these rights cost a lot of hard and bitter struggle, but in retrospect, they proved to be much greater and longer-lasting gains than the increase in wages in one's pay packet, which vanished just as quickly as inflation, which characterized the period after the war and up until 1990, as many remember.
The background to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although in the end men agreed that the funds would in fact be owned by the members, the labour movement had to accept that the boards of the funds would be made up of equal numbers of representatives of employers and members.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of labourers in the boards of the funds was often discussed in labour circles, but it never came to fruition, and so we are still stuck with the unnatural situation where the representatives of the fund members are not in the majority in the boards of the funds.
In Article 36 of the Act no. 129/1997 on compulsory pension insurance and the operation of pension funds, provisions are made for the investment policy of the funds.
In the first bullet point, it says that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the pensioners as its guiding principle."
Also, in the 5th paragraph, it says: "The pension fund shall set ethical guidelines for its investments."
In the investment policy of the Lífeyrissjóður verslunarmanna, there are the following provisions, in continuation of the aforementioned legal provisions:
The pension fund is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the United States and Europe.
The rules cover how an emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to better investment outcomes for investment funds.
In this way, the interests of investors and the objectives of society as a whole go hand in hand in a broader context.
LV considers it important for companies, especially those listed on the stock exchange, to have a public policy on: good corporate governance, remuneration and social responsibility, and environmental issues.
Lífeyrissjóðurinn Gildi, which is one of the largest pension funds in the country, has set itself "a policy on responsible investments" and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all brought up here as an introduction to the latest buzzword in Icelandic, "shadow governance".
Since the word is new in the language, it is not to be expected that it has been fully defined, but the following definition seems to be the "most taken": Shadow management is when a trade union leader says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the trade union to the board of the pension fund with instructions or instructions on how they should take a stand in a certain matter.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the first opportunity.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about dismissal, then it is not "shadow management" after all, since such communication between people is always the case in the financial world, as in any other.
I leave it up to the reader to decide which path is "darker."
There are two men who have tried to shape this definition as of the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
It is Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, governor of the Central Bank of Iceland.
The reason for both was that after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (firing them), Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, president of the Reykjavík Verslunarmannafélag, sent out those recommendations to the representatives of the company in the board of directors of the Lífeyrissjóður Verslunarmanna to not support the possible purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they might be forced to resign.
A short time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and in the wake of this, Ragnar Þór also withdrew his recommendations, which were of course based on the decision of Bogi.
Despite this, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to comment on the matter in the Friday edition of Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow government, lawbreaking, and the urgent need for changes to the law.
There, a small tuft really did manage to move a heavy load, even though the blessed tuft was in the passive voice and, in addition, was quickly eradicated.
Since the matter is important, let's focus on the substance at the end.
I outlined above the provisions of the law on pension funds relating to this matter.
This entails that pension fund managers must act in the interest of pension fund members and have ethical guidelines in their investments, and these aspects are further defined in the statutes of both Gildi and the Icelandic National Pension Fund, as I mentioned.
Pension funds, on the other hand, SHOULD NOT focus solely on short-term profitability in their investments.
Such a course of action would indeed be highly dangerous, and there is no need to look far for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have been channelled to reckless adventurers and environmental vandals, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was clearly on thin ice when he thought it would be a good idea to fire an entire group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed on the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-à-vis investors.
Fortunately, he saw the error of his ways and retracted his statement.
Time will tell whether the investment of the pension funds in the company is deemed to be a responsible investment when all is said and done.

One of the infected did not observe home quarantine
One of the three who tested positive for Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in Iceland from an Easter Baltic country on the 15th of July, about one and a half weeks ago.
He is an Icelander who is not living here permanently and therefore did not receive clear instructions to observe the so-called home quarantine after arriving in the country and take another test a few days after arriving.
He received a negative result from the screening at the border.
“But he is in the Icelandic community, and in fact, he is supposed to go into that treatment," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist in infectious diseases at the Landlæknisembætti and deputy chief medical officer while the chief medical officer is on vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered, you are not automatically invited to the second test."
She says that the man was able to use the English registration form because he was actually living abroad, but because of his ties to the country as an Icelander, he should have used the Icelandic form.
However, he did not realize this.
If the number is not registered, you have to apply for the second test yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realised that this was the right thing to do," says Kamilla.
So it is clear that we need to improve the information on this while we try to find a way to make an automated booking system even though Icelanders do not register their ID numbers.
Or else to make it more obvious who is participating in Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the person in question has only been in contact with a few people since arriving in the country, even though he is classified as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelandic citizen.
Only six people have been sent into quarantine since he was diagnosed yesterday, and these six people were all in contact with him.
They are scheduled to be tested, but two of them are already showing symptoms of a Covid-19 infection.
The man tested negative in a sample taken at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says it is likely that he was recently infected with the virus and that it has not yet been possible to detect it in his body when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the possibility that the man contracted the disease in Iceland, but did not bring the virus with him to the country.
“It’s not quite possible to say that this is definitely an imported infection because it’s been so long since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like the two who have caused a small outbreak in connection with the sporting events.”
However, she says this is very unlikely because of how few people he was in contact with here.
“It is actually very unlikely," says Kamilla, but adds that it is not possible to rule it out until the Icelandic Genetics Institute has sequenced the virus in the man.
“If we get a virus type that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he brought it to the country.”
Pepper spray and tear gas used against protesters
There were clashes between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and non-lethal grenades on protesters, who broke windows and set fires.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Protests against police brutality and racism were held across the United States last night, with the Seattle protests in solidarity with those in Portland, Oregon.
One protester was shot and killed in Austin, Texas.
According to BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered for peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows at the city's courthouse.
Following this, the police said the protests were riots and there were clashes between groups of protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of National Guard members gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her home in March.
The group carried firearms and marched in formation at a closed intersection where police ordered them to disperse from a group of people who were protesting the protests and also carried firearms.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man killed by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: This is not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, manager of Manchester United, does not want to overstate the importance of today's game against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose to Wolves, ending Solskjær and his men in fifth place and missing out on the Champions League.
However, they still have a chance to qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League in the next month.
„We are not at the end of the road.
If we get a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we have not had a bad season," said Solskjær.
„But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a long way to go to catch up with the teams above us,“ said Solskjær.
It is clear that the nerves of men will be stretched at 15:00 today, but Solskjær tried to act as if it was just another game.
„If you want to be part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is what the company is based on.
We have created ourselves a great opportunity to end the season on a high and now it's up to us to take it," said Solskjær.
„Þetta er ekki mikilvægasti leikur tímabilsins, þetta er bara næsti leikur.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our season, we have already had many moments that define this season."
“Bruno Fernandes’ arrival has made a big difference to us and I believe we are in a better shape both physically and mentally than last season,” said Solskjær.
65,000 cases per day
65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were reported in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
To date, a total of 41,780,210 cases have been confirmed in the United States.
900 people died of the virus yesterday, but in the four days leading up to that, more than 1,000 people died of the virus each day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, the number of deaths caused by the virus is expected to reach 175,000 by August 15, according to the projections of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Fear a second wave of the pandemic
The Spanish government is now struggling to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19 on both Thursday and Friday.
The number of new cases has not been higher in 24 hours since the beginning of May, and the news comes at the same time as Spaniards begin to lift one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.
The backlash led to the UK government now requiring travellers from Spain to self-isolate on arrival.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is at its worst in Catalonia in the northeast of Spain, where the authorities have imposed far-reaching restrictions in an attempt to stem the spread.
In the city of Barcelona, bars and nightclubs will be closed for the next two weeks and nightclubs will have to close at midnight.
Now, a curfew is in effect for 200,000 residents of Segria province in Catalonia's western region.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the influx of foreign tourists and has been badly hit by the pandemic.
Tui, the largest travel agency in the UK, has cancelled all flights to Spain and the Canary Islands scheduled for today.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for a second wave of the pandemic, but little appetite seems to be for a return to the widespread lockdowns that have devastated economies.
For example, Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, has taken a very dim view of this and compared it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Jean Castex, Prime Minister of France, has said that the country "would not survive economically or socially" if a nationwide lockdown were to be reintroduced.
Many leaders are hoping that localized measures that target individual towns, cities, or regions will be enough to slow the spread of the virus in the next phase of the outbreak.
Five new cases of COVID-19 in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic cases were detected yesterday, in addition to two more at the border.
Five individuals tested positive for COVID-19 in Iceland yesterday.
According to a statement from the Civil Protection, one of the infections is related to the infection detected yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been placed in isolation and the sixteen people who were in close contact with him have been placed in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in a sports club in Reykjavík and is, according to the announcement, "only a part of the sports team" in quarantine.
Others who were sent into quarantine are connected to the man in other ways.
The source of this infection is unknown and contact tracing is ongoing by the National Police Chiefs' Council.
The organizers of the ReyCUP tournament have adhered to the guidelines and regulations of the Chief Epidemiologist and the Civil Protection Authority, and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures from yesterday's game attracted attention as they showed players in very close contact to celebrate their team's good performance on the field.
Just before 11:00 today, the organizers of the event posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
There it says, "ATTENTION: Parents please respect the rules that competitors must collect their own equipment from the school.
Foreldrum er EKKI heimilt að gera það.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection detected the day before.
According to the announcement, "Icelandic Genetics has sequenced the infections and a new strain of the virus has been identified that has not been found here before."
Smitrakning is also underway in the case, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 people are in quarantine due to the infection.
The third case involves a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15.
He was diagnosed in the southwest of the country.
He is now in isolation and the six who were in close contact with him while in quarantine.
Two of them are already showing signs of infection.
In addition, two were detected at the border and are awaiting the results of further investigations, as the procedure for detecting infections at the border stipulates.
Finally, the statement says: The Icelandic National Commissioner of the Police and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer urge people to take precautions and pay attention to individual infection prevention.
If there is any doubt that symptoms of the COVID-19 virus are present, the individual is asked to go to the nearest health center for a test.
Patreksfjörður says campsite is fully booked for Easter - directs visitors elsewhere
The campsite in Patreksfjörður is fully booked for the weekend, according to a notice from Vesturbyggð.
Guests are advised to look at other accommodation options.
It names Vesturbyggð as Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes on Rauðasandi, Hotel Flókalundur and Hotel Breiðavík as other options.
There is a lot going on in Patreksfjörður this weekend, because as in previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentaries, is being held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
Based on the interest in the campsite, one can expect a good turnout this year, if the weather does not get in the way, as DV reported earlier today.
However, the worst weather is expected in the south, and there is hope for Patreksfirðingar.
The bb.is website was the first to report, saying that all other accommodation in the town was already fully booked.
An entire apartment block is crumbling down in the best location in the city
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18–20.
Meanwhile, the owners are seeking a building permit for the renovations, but their application has been languishing in the system for three years.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjavík stands a large apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the building, there are approximately 600 square metres of retail space.
Behind the house are two stairwells, each with four fairly spacious apartments.
They are between 93 and 130 square metres, though most are over 100.
The house has a rich history.
It was built in 1959 and has also housed a video rental, Skóstofan, Mjólkursamsölunni's milk shop, Jói the gunsmith, a fish shop, and most recently the University Printshop.
The house has, to put it mildly, seen better days.
The house is now badly damaged, as can be seen in the pictures below.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
According to the company register, the owners of D18 ehf. are, among others, Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús was in charge of the owner group of Borgun and was the managing director of the ownership company Borgun.
Among the shareholders of Borgun eignarhaldsfélagsins is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also a co-owner of a third of D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, ran the shipping company Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has done little to maintain it since then.
Neighbours say the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily over the years, though most recently.
On a Facebook page for residents of the neighborhood, one resident said the house had been "not very lively" in recent years.
This may be due to the fact that the owners have been trying for several years to change the house and the plot.
Neighbours say the house has been in disrepair for a long time.
“It’s long overdue to do something about this eyesore and it’s a shame it’s taken so long.”
He also says that he is pissed off at the owners of the house for not finishing it, finding a common ground with the neighbors, and ending this "legal battle."
“Just do it in consultation with the community around you so that you can get it done and finished.”
The "legal bottleneck" that the resident refers to is the planning process for the area, which has been ongoing at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build an extra floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind it, a new lift house and a one-storey extension, as well as a basement.
The permit granted for that construction was appealed to the Administrative Court of Iceland and the court annulled the permit since the construction was not in accordance with the zoning plan and the public notification was insufficient.
Reykjavíkurborg started the zoning plan process and completed it with an announcement in Stjórnartíðindum in July last year.
The same plan was also contested and was declared null and void by the committee in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit, and the owners of the property on the corner lot.
The house had deteriorated considerably by this time, and the neighbours were beginning to tire of it.
When DV asked neighbors about the situation and their reactions, the answers were varied.
Some understood the intentions of the owners of the house, others did not at all.
Others directed their anger at the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily at anyone in particular.
Others said the parking spaces were a thorny issue, but neighbours have been using the unused parking spaces at Dunhaga 18–20 for their cars.
One of the complainants in the case said he was fed up with the bureaucracy:
„That we should have to go through the process three times is just unbelievable.
It's like Reykjavíkurborg can't read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the city's laissez-faire administration and the noble intentions of the owner and many years of work by them, now at a standstill.
When a reporter arrived at Dunhaga 18, the doors were wide open and a pile of rubbish greeted him.
A Playstation console and a new TV lay among other rubbish on the ground - victims of Icelandic summer cleaning.
The door was open into the old office of the University Press, and there were quite a few cats in there, judging by the smell.
It is clear that someone has taken up residence in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of couches and beds, and a few stacks of geology pages, which probably were going to be a book, lay around.
The stairwells of the apartment building were open and life was in both of them.
The reporter was so lucky to run into a resident of one of them.
There were Romanians cooking potatoes for dinner and invited the reporter in.
The Romanians work for the staffing agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and according to DV, the company has not paid for the premises except for heating and electricity.
Due to the condition of the building, it is not considered reasonable to charge rent.
From the post boxes in the foyer of the building it is clear that there has been a large number of foreign workers living there in recent years.
The operation of staffing agencies has not been immune from the effects of the Covid-19 situation, as the downturn in tourism has led to a downturn in the construction industry, and these two industries have been the most active in using the services of staffing agencies.
Despite this, it seemed as though the residents of Dunhaga 18 still had plenty to do and the work clothes and gloves were hanging out to dry in the communal area after a long day in the rain.
It should be noted, however, that despite the appalling state of the house, the boys' shared accommodation appeared to be well-maintained.
When the Romanian reporter said goodbye to the boys, the irony suddenly became clear to him: In the best location in Reykjavík, a 1,500-square-metre property is in ruins.
The owners want to improve the building and the neighbours want better conditions, but they disagree about what constitutes "improvement".
In the middle sits the city's planning department, a victim of endless appeal and complaint routes in the planning process, and a slow-moving Administrative Court of Environment and Natural Resources.
In the house live Romanian workers, perhaps exactly those who will improve the situation when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in the weekend edition of DV on July 17.
In an effort to combat obesity in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic
Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson will give £10 million to a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his own illness, partly caused by his weight.
It is understood that Johnson will launch the Better Health campaign tomorrow (Monday), with the initiative encouraging doctors to prescribe cycling to overweight patients, as well as a drive to increase the number of cycle lanes.
Advertisements for fast-food outlets will be banned from television after 21:00, according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has woken us up to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we use this time to become healthier, more active and eat more healthily,” the spokesperson said.
Johnson has himself struggled with weight issues, and was admitted to intensive care when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly because of his weight that he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women are better suited to lead the changes
She said the new constitution is the biggest step the country can take towards greater decentralisation, transparency and in the fight against corruption and for the common good.
“We need to change gear a little bit now and who is better placed to lead that change than that section of society that is more comfortable with those values.
It's women," said Helga.
Women in Iceland are famous for their women's solidarity.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
So now it's just up to us to lead these changes."
She said she was a little concerned about the focus on Iceland as "the best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
„Þá erum við ekki jafn tilbúin að skoða hvað þarf að gera.
Like the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
There's a lot of it.
We have to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We do not all live by the same rules here," said Helga.
When asked, she said that women are in many ways doing well in Iceland, but added that, like in many other places, Icelandic men still live by very masculine values.
According to her, politics revolve around self-interest, power and control, which are the forces that perpetuate injustice in all societies.
„Women have now set up this group and come together and are just getting a bit fed up with the fact that the Icelandic parliament keeps on ignoring this referendum from 2012," she said.
„Það eru þessi kvenlægu gildi sem við erum að hugsa þetta út frá.
From the perspective of human rights and environmental protection, cooperation and the fact that we are all sitting at the same table, really," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the founding principles of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country in terms of natural resources and it's ridiculous that people are living in poverty here.
It's crazy, we can do it differently," said Helga.
It's ridiculous that there's some kind of natural law that says that women's jobs are always going to be paid less.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses are constantly having to fight for decent wages."

Tried to rob a pedestrian in the city centre
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after he threatened a pedestrian and tried to steal money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbæ, where two people were arrested in connection with the case.
The police stopped a motorcyclist in Hlíðarnar, where the motorcyclist was driving at 146 km/h in a 60 km/h zone.
In addition, he had previously been stripped of his driving licence.
The Icelandic police in the greater Reykjavik area had their hands full in the night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police log from 5pm yesterday to 5am today.
There were a lot of noise complaints about parties.
In the early hours of Saturday, eleven noisy parties were reported and this was considered a lot in the police log.
In the night, however, 22 noise complaints were filed with the police.
Sex menn voru vistaðir í gæsluvarðhald í nótt.
Police were called to the Árbæ area last night after shots were fired into the air.
However, they had managed to get away by the time the police arrived.
Nine drivers were stopped for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Four people were arrested in connection with the brawl in the city centre last night, one of whom was taken into custody.
Two were taken to the emergency department after falling on their faces, one in the city centre and one in Vesturbær.
One person was transported to the emergency room after injuring themselves while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who was pulling a trailer on Kjalarnes yesterday.
The trailer's hitch was in "very bad condition," according to police reports, and was impounded.
It is possible to stay in Monet's house during the holiday
The house that the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life in is now available to rent on Airbnb.
The next available nights in the house are over the August bank holiday weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two sitting rooms and three bathrooms.
It was in this house that Monet first got the inspiration to paint his famous gardens.
If someone wants to rent the house, they must rent it for at least two nights.
According to Airbnb's website, it's available in just over a week's time, on Sunday of the upcoming holiday weekend, so it might be a good idea for some retail workers on holiday to book the painter's house while they're at it.
The two nights over the holiday weekend cost only 964 US dollars, or about 130,000 Icelandic krónur, according to Fréttablaðið.
Hundreds in quarantine and some of them showing symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus within the past three days, and most of those who are infected are not connected.
Dozens have been placed in quarantine as a result and some of them are showing symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people tested positive for the coronavirus in Iceland yesterday and two at the border checkpoint.
A specialist at the Office of the Chief Medical Officer says that the increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in society.
The first domestic infection has been sequenced and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been circulating undetected in the community for any length of time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very vigilant now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, a specialist in infectious diseases at the office of the Chief Medical Officer.
The majority of those who have been infected have been in contact with individuals who have come from abroad.
Further tests will be carried out in the coming days, but a number of those who were in contact with the infected have started to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Now we don’t have influenza circulating, and there are fewer other respiratory infections, so we can be a bit more liberal in doing these tests on individuals who, during influenza season, would have been recommended to do something else first,” said Kamilla.
Most of the contact tracing has been completed, but it is not ruled out that more people will have to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected individuals tested positive after attending a sporting event.
Has this raised questions as to whether it is appropriate to hold such events.
The head of emergency communications says it's possible as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says it is practically impossible for the infected to have contracted the disease at the sports event.
„If more people do not go into self-isolation as a result of these individuals having been in contact with them at these sporting events, then we can say that our measures at the events have worked.
We don't know yet," said Kamilla.
The prosecution of the Civil Protection Department is constantly being reviewed.
“We need to be ready to step in with further advice or restrictions if necessary,” said Kamilla.
After about a week, it is planned to increase the limit to 1,000 people.
This new position could affect the easing of restrictions.
A "certain meditation to cook" - See Elísa Viðar's menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an athlete in football and plays for Valur.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food technologist.
She needs a lot of energy to get through the day and often takes the time to cook a healthy and nutritious meal.
A normal day for me starts with going to work around eight in the morning," says Elísa.
“After work, I go to the grocery store to be able to prepare dinner before picking up my daughter from daycare at three o’clock.”
Elísa finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early from nursery.
It's good to have time with her before I go to training in the afternoon.
After a workout, it's nice to come home and not have to warm up the food.
In the evenings, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to clear our minds."
Elísa does not follow any particular diet.
She is currently working on her master's thesis in nutrition and knows exactly what she needs to eat to have enough energy for work, school, family, and training.
“What works for me is eating a variety of foods that are well-balanced with protein, carbohydrates and fat.
I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not to categorize food as good or bad, healthy or unhealthy.
It's okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time."
Elísa is very interested in cooking.
There is a certain meditative quality to standing in the kitchen and cooking, which I really enjoy.
I have to say that confidence is with me in the kitchen and I really believe that I am a good cook."
Breakfast: oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, soaked in almond milk overnight.
Finish off this meal with whatever is on hand.
Usually it's banana and crunchy muesli & COFFEE.
I am a big coffee drinker.
Minimal: It varies a lot, but fruit or vegetables, flatbread, plain yoghurt with banana and muesli, bread with toppings and I could eat hummus with a spoon from a box if that's what's on offer.
Lunch: I often make big salads out of what's in the fridge, quinoa or wheat, falafel balls, romaine lettuce, baked vegetables with a good dressing is what I'm working with.
If the planning goes out of control (which happens often), the egg whisk at work has come to my rescue many times, and that's two slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, I won't put any more on you.
Pre-workout snack: Something with carbohydrates, such as bread with toppings, muesli or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is often on the menu at my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
Local authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of emergency following widespread protests in the city's downtown.
Police used tear gas and pepper spray yesterday to try to clear a large area that protesters had taken over and stretched across several blocks near the Capitol.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into the vandalism of a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with a bomb.
Borgar- og lögregluyfirvöld segja að mótmælendur hafi grýtt lögreglu með grjóti, flöskum, hvellsprengjum og öðru lauslegu og var einn lögreglumaður fluttur á sjúkrahús þar sem gert var að meiðslum hans.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They were called in to show solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there have been repeated clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal law enforcement officers.
There, as in many other cities in the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, remembering George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systemic racism in the American society and demanding improvements.
Not revocable until after the vote
It is still not clear whether the dismissal of the Icelandair flight attendants, which is to take effect next month, will be revoked.
Electronic voting on a collective agreement for Icelandair cabin crew, represented by the Icelandic Airline Cabin Crew Association, will end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the chairwoman of the union, is certain that Icelandair will not make a decision about the layoffs until the results of the vote are in.
“This is definitely connected,” says Guðlaug Líney.
“There have been no cancellations reversed, this has to be put in place so that the planes can be manned.
Of course, people are also eager to find out whether they will have a job after the end of the month."
A vote is being held on a treaty that was signed last week, on the night of July 19.
It is expected to run until the end of September 2025 and is based on a previous agreement that the cabin crew had previously rejected in a ballot.
On July 17, the board and the executive committee of the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association voted to call for an all-out strike at Icelandair, which was approved by the members in a vote.
It never came to pass, but it was decided in the wake of Icelandair's decision to end negotiations with the flight attendants' union, to dismiss all of its flight attendants and seek a collective bargaining agreement with another union.
At that time, the airline's pilots were to take on the role of safety officers on board on a temporary basis.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's difficult to say.
People are still reeling from Icelandair's attack, when the airline fired all its flight attendants and announced it would negotiate with a different union.
Now we'll see if it has an effect," she says.
940 flight attendants were working for Icelandair at the end of April, when 900 of them, or 95%, were told their contracts would not be renewed.
Their notice period varies, for those with the shortest working life, it is three months and ends at the end of July/August.
About 90% of Icelandair's flight attendants are in that group.
What happens if the agreement is not accepted?
Then we are looking forward to continuing the dialogue with our counterparts.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair's requirements.
If he is turned down, it is clear that the flight attendants feel that he has gone too far."
Voting on the collective agreement will end tomorrow and Icelandair will announce its third-quarter results tomorrow.
Voting on a new collective agreement for flight attendants will end at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's second-quarter results will also be published tomorrow, with preliminary results indicating that the airline's revenue fell by 85 percent from the same period last year.
Electronic voting on a collective agreement between the Icelandair cabin crew union and the Association of Icelandic Employers began on Wednesday, July 22, and will end on Monday, July 27, at noon.
Those who are entitled to vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the Icelandair Flight Attendants Association.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective bargaining agreement in the early hours of Sunday, July 19th, after Icelandair ended negotiations with the union on Friday, July 17th, after flight attendants rejected the previous collective bargaining agreement in a vote at the beginning of July.
Icelandair had fired all of its flight attendants and ground crew on Friday, but the dismissals were rescinded after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed.
According to the new collective agreement, flight attendants will have to fly five hours more per month for the same salary.
The collective agreement is valid until 2025, and it includes provisions for pilots and flight attendants on how long they can work in one shift.
The agreement was presented to FFÍ members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and many flight attendants who spoke to the news agency expressed their dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most seemed to agree, however, that the agreement would have to be accepted to keep FFÍ alive.
Icelandair's second-quarter results will be announced tomorrow, and the company's EBIT, operating profit before interest and tax, is expected to be negative by 100 to 110 million US dollars, or 15 billion Icelandic króna, according to preliminary results.
Icelandair sent the stock exchange preliminary figures last Wednesday, which showed that the company's revenue amounted to around $6 million, or 830 million ISK, in the quarter.
Cash and cash equivalents were $154 million at the end of the quarter, around $2.1 billion.
Icelandair is also aiming to offer shares in the company for sale in August.
Icelandair is aiming to complete negotiations with 15 lenders, the government and Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before going ahead with a share issue.
A new strain rather than a new species of virus
„Ný veira þýðir bara að þetta hefur verið einstaklingur sem kom erlendis frá.
This is not something that has been simmering here domestically," says Már Kristjánsson, head of the infectious diseases department at Landspítalinn, about the news that a "new type of virus" has been detected here in Iceland.
Three domestic cases were confirmed yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the Rey Cup football tournament, and the source of the infection has not yet been found, and the epidemiological investigation is ongoing.
In addition, the virus was detected in an individual who arrived in the country on July 15, and two people who were in contact with him have begun to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, a new infection was detected that is related to the infection detected the day before, and after genetic sequencing by the Icelandic Genetics Institute, a "new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
Smitrakningu er lokið í tengslum við það smit.
Már points out that this is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread all over the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to talk about a new strain of that virus rather than a new species of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could say anything about the start of a second wave, Már says that at the moment it is a single case and it could be that nothing more will come of it.
“However, if there are cases within the country that are not connected to the outside world and are of the same strain as this particular variant, then it would be possible to draw that conclusion [of a second wave], but it is premature at this stage,” explains Már.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Iceland's happiness to be found in the hot tubs?
BBC producers lead viewers to believe that it is likely in an amusing video that sheds light on the nation's sauna and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is unique in the world and it is claimed that there are more bathing places per capita in Iceland than anywhere else in the world.
The natural geothermal energy is the basis of it, but also the tradition of swimming.
Swimming lessons for children were made compulsory in 1940, but older people are just as keen to make use of the hot water for their health.
Boat trips are described as an integral part of the general welfare of the nation.
In pottinum eru allir jafnir, óháð stétt og stöðu.
Away from mobile phones, people talk to each other on a personal note about home and abroad or enjoy the healing power of water: meditate and recharge the batteries of the soul and body.
It's going to be a tough hundred days in the run-up to the elections
There are 100 days until Americans go to the polls to elect a president for the next four years.
Donald Trump is running for re-election, but he is facing an uphill battle.
Joe Biden, demókrataframbjóðandinn, hefur mikinn forskot á Trump á landsvísu, sé mið tekið af skoðanakönnunum.
According to a new poll by the Associated Press news agency, a record number of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans than ever before believe that the president is handling the economy poorly.
Specifically, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the pandemic and 48 percent say he has handled the economy well.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average of FiveThirtyEight, Biden's support is 49.9 percent nationwide, while Trump's support is 41.9 percent.
Trump sjálfur hefur reynt að færa athyglina frá frammistöðu hans gagnvart faraldrinum að Biden, ýta undir svokallaðar menningardeilur og boða stefnumál sem eiga að snúa að lögum og reglu.
However, Biden's campaign is putting a lot of effort into keeping the focus on Trump and believes that there are good chances of winning if the election is really about how Trump has performed over the past four years.
The unpopularity of Trump also seems to be affecting Republicans in Congress, and there are fears that Democrats could even gain a majority in the US Senate, which has been considered very unlikely until now.
According to Politico, the Republicans would suffer their worst defeat in decades if the current support for the parties and the candidates remains the same.
The suburbs have proved particularly troublesome for the party in the 2016 general election and it looks like that trend will continue.
Trump hefur á undanförnum dögum reynt að hræða íbúa úthverfa til að fylgja sér, meðal annars með því að segja að verði Biden forseti, muni hann rústa úthverfum Bandaríkjanna og ýta undir kynþáttadeilur.
Among other things, Trump has rescinded a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in suburban areas.
He then urged "housewives" in the suburbs of the United States to read an article by a former deputy governor of New York, in which she claimed that Biden would destroy the suburbs of the United States and took Trump's side.
„Biden mun rústa hverfum ykkar og bandaríska draumnum.
I will preserve it, and even make it better!" said the president.
Residents of the suburbs of the United States are a growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the most votes from this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney received a majority of the vote from this group, but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that, despite Trump's narrow victory in the suburbs in 2016, his support there has plummeted.
Although the margin varies from poll to poll, Biden has been polling with a fifteen-point lead over Trump in the swing states in recent polls.

Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision was made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that has only been interrupted by world wars, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic flame would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," referring to the coronavirus pandemic that the world is currently going through together.
Athletes have an extra year to prepare and Japan's authorities are footing the bill for the postponement.
Everyone holds their nerve, after all, it's a lot at stake.
When it was announced that the 2020 Olympic Games would be held in Tokyo, Japan, the joy of the Japanese athletes was genuine.
They cried and laughed alternately, for Tokyo had applied to host the Games in 2016 but lost out to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
This time it was Tokyo and Japan's turn to bathe in the world's attention.
The Games were scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed by a year and will begin on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If it is not possible to hold the games, if the coronavirus is still too much of a threat, the games will be cancelled.
Nevertheless, no one wants to think it through to the end.
The Olympic Games are no ordinary sporting event.
Nothing is spared, the show must always be spectacular and strive to top the last games.
The selection of the host city for the Olympic Games is based on the assessment of the bidding cities by the evaluation committee.
The more spectacular the presentation - the greater the chances of winning.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to keep the 2016 Olympics, or about $20 billion in today's money.
In the second time, when they applied for the games in 2020, 75 million dollars, about 10 billion ISK, were invested in the campaign.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the games this year, Japanese authorities had already spent 30 billion yen on the project.
The amount is, however, just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build an Olympic village, venues and generally to strengthen the infrastructure of the country to be able to host such an event, prepare for it and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which were postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
However, in a report from Japan's auditor general, which was released at the end of last year, it was stated that the actual cost was closer to double that figure.
It is likely that it will not be possible to determine the full cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost an additional two to six billion dollars on top of the initial cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could run as high as $1.5 billion to $3 billion.
The numbers are so high that the tax revenues of the Icelandic government would only cover about half of an Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of analysis by economists, who try to look at the numbers and assess the benefits and advantages of the Games.
In short, it seems that a lot of people have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games is far from being positive for the economies of the cities that host them.
Short-term effects are noticeable, for example, a lot of jobs are created in the short term, but in the long term, cities often end up with a debt burden and high operating costs for little-used infrastructure.
Rio de Janeiro in Brazil is saddled with huge debts from the 2016 Games and has struggled to fund the upkeep of all the large sporting venues built for the Games.
Statistics have been analyzed after the London 2012 Olympic Games, and it has come to light that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
This means that there were not many new jobs created.
In general, cities have not fared well financially from hosting the Olympics due to the exorbitant cost of the facilities built for the games.
However, there is often considered to be a benefit in increased tourist traffic to the Olympic cities after the games, which is, however, a great uncertainty about the games in 2021.
It is also unclear whether it will be possible to accommodate the large number of spectators who normally attend the games.
The main thing, however, is the honour of being chosen, which is difficult to put a price on.
Even though the cost is enormous, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not of a kind that can be put a price on.
Even though the exhibition is often spectacular and no expense is spared, it is not just about money.
The focus is on the sporting heroes.
For some elite athletes, postponing the Games is just what the doctor ordered.
The Australian pentathlete and gold medalist in her event at the 2016 Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is pregnant and would have been out of action this summer, but is hoping to be in competitive shape for the 2021 Games.
Therefore, she is one of the athletes who is quite happy with the postponement, for obvious reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after the Games this year, they would have been held at the right time, which means that postponement of the Games in some cases means that they retire before the Games even begin.
Just don't trust your body to go through another year of intense training.
Very few athletes at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games captured the hearts of spectators as much as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold medals and one bronze.
Biles has appeared in several interviews in her home country of the United States in recent weeks to discuss the Olympics.
She is aiming for the Games in 2021, but she is not sure if she will still be at the top in 2022, when she will be 24 years old.
Although it is not generally considered to be a high age for a gymnast at the top of her game, it is in the upper echelons.
“It’s a sensitive subject,” Biles says in the interview, but she’s smiling as she says it, in an Instagram video posted by the U.S. Olympic Committee. Asked if she’s aiming to go as far as she did in Rio in 2016, she says, “It’s a sensitive subject.”
„Ég veit ekki hvort ég verð enn á toppnum eftir heilt ár í viðbót af æfingum,“ segir Biles.
She has previously talked about her body not being able to handle the stress of gymnastics training for much longer.
Despite this, she is training hard for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admitted that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop training when the pandemic was at its peak and the gymnastics gym was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles or anyone else during the seven-week closure of all Olympic venues.
All of her Olympic gold medals couldn't buy her any extra access, she had to find other ways to stay in shape like everyone else.
The basic form is, of course, a little better than with most people.
We have a strict plan in place now.
It was difficult to start training again after the gymnastics hall reopened.
We started off slowly, but we're back in full swing again and I'll be increasing my training as the year goes on.
Of course we don't know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we are practicing as if they will be, we can't do anything else.
I'm not ready to walk away from the sport just yet," Biles said.
Like her and many others, there is a nagging doubt that the Games will not be held in 2021 after all.
However, predicting it is impossible.
No one knows how the situation with the global coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021, and the only thing to do is to prepare for the Olympic Games, taking into account that they will be held a year later.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Postponed wedding due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
„I think there are more important things to think about right now,“ the actress said in an interview with People.
„Við viljum endilega gifta okkur einhvern tímann og eiga þá draumabrúðkaupið og hafa alla viðstadda sem eru okkur kærir.
We decided to postpone it and focus on what's important right now, which is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I'm more interested in world issues than wedding issues these days.
There's a lot going on and we should be paying attention to what's going on in the world."
