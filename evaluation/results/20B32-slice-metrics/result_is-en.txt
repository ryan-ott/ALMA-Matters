He shouted at the world.
The marketing campaign "Looks Like You Need Iceland" has been well received and cries and shouts can be heard in the wilderness all over the world.
"The Icelanders have a colony, I need Iceland " says a woman from the other side of the world in commentary on the advertisement from the marketing campaign " Looks Like You Need Iceland " on the YouTube channel.
The second viewer says that he will keep Iceland in his heart forever and an unmarried woman says that she will come to Iceland as soon as possible because her husband is living there.
In the meantime, she is in the United States, where she has to wait for a few months more..
Another spectator asks whether the roads to Iceland are open, because there are no planes.
It is not known whether he comes from another time belt.
Egill Þórðarson from the advertising agency Peel, who worked on the advert with the international advertising agency M & C Saatchi, says that the response has exceeded expectations.
" He has been involved in many of Iceland's " Inspired by Iceland " campaigns, which have been very successful, but this new campaign is already breaking records.
In essence, the goal is to create a PR effect, that is to get foreign media to cover the campaign,, and this has gone extremely well.
In a relatively short time, they have received coverage in over 700 media outlets around the world, reaching more than 2 billion people.
The value of the coverage is estimated at 180 million krones.
It is not a bad thing.
The main market for the campaign is the United States, and it has gone very well there despite the Americans not being on their way to the country.
According to Egil, known markets such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also taken well to it, as well as Russia, which came as a pleasant surprise.
There have been reactions from foreign areas, such as India, that were not specifically targeted.
"Theses advertisements have traveled further than they expected, " Egill says, and it is estimated that over four million people have watched the material on YouTube.
" They had not been able to ask for a better start. "
The pictures here were taken by Årni Sæberg, a photographer for the newspaper Morgenbladet, during the filming of advertisements with the slogan " Let It Out " in mid- the last month.
The filming took place all over the country, in Reykjavik on Skovorodden, at Reynisfjord, at Sólheimajökli and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfda.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cameraman was Óttar Guðnason.
In these roles, the Norwegian Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
The Icelandic crew worked on the making of the advertisements, at the same time as recording took place in Southern Norway, while another group was working in Western Norway and the Vestfjords.
According to Egil, " Let It Out " is only the first part of the " Looks Like You Need Iceland " campaign, but a winter campaign is planned in cooperation with M & C Saatchi.
"This is the first phase of the work for the Icelandic Tourist Office,, Egill says, and adds that the collaboration with M & C Saatchi has gone very well.
"It's fantastic to work with them.
In such projects, it is crucial to have a foreign partner with knowledge of the markets they are talking about.

As soon as he read the script, he knew who this character was., said Donovan about his role in Clueless.
He did not want to leave the police station after the night shift.
Fifty cases were brought to the police in the capital area on the day, and the police's daybook states that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to intervene in a man who had been recently released from custody after having been detained for drunken driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man was allowed to stay at the police station because of his behaviour..
In the morning, a man was arrested on suspicion of breaking into a company in Kópavog..

The death of the Gleestar - The tragic fate of the Gleestars.
This theory has gained popularity on the Internet, as the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California a few days ago and became the third lead actor to die before the age of 40 in the series.
The Glee series is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The series dealt with the so-called happy band of high school students, their love affairs and their fate.
It was not always taken with joy to be a member of the choir, but through song and dance, the characters of the series managed to overcome the obstacles that arose in their lives.
In the absence of the filming location, great tragedies have befallen the actors and crew members of the series, to the extent that rumors have begun to circulate about a curse on the series.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the series, a cheerleader who did not call all her mother.
After the series ran its course, Rivera went on to marry actor Ryan Dorsey and had one son, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they separated as a result.
However, Dorsey declined to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On 8 July last, it was announced that Riveru was missing after her four--year old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a lifeboat on board the ship and was able to tell the police that he and his mother had jumped into the water and were rescued by Rivera, but never returned to the ship.
The search for Rivera began in earnest.
The day after the search began, the police chief of the area announced that it was believed that Rivera had drowned.

Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson, the American football player with the angelic voice, who played a key role in bringing the Glee choir to fame.
Outside of the shows, Moneith was struggling with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his colleagues in the series found that he had become a burden and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith went into treatment at that time and seemed to be on the path to recovery.
Only two months after he finished treatment, Moneith was found dead in his hotel room after going out to celebrate with friends..
The mixture of drugs and alcohol was deadly.
It was not believed that it was an act of will.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for drugs had decreased so much that a substance that he had previously tolerated well proved to be lethal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
The death of his co---star, Lea Michele,' s boyfriend, was a heavy burden for his co-- stars, but under the auspices of Michele' s girlfriend, it was decided to continue the series and dedicate it to the memory of Moneith and his character, Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah " Puck " Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow Glee Club members until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.

During a search of his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found and the matter quickly became public..
Ljóst was that Salling was finished.
He was charged and convicted for his crimes.
He had been sentenced to four to seven years in prison, in addition to having to register as a sex offender.
Before the judge had decided on the punishment, Salling, who was then out of custody, was found near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not only the actors in the series who fell away long before they reached old age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the episodes.
He died in his sleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
Nancy Motes was also involved in the production of the show..
She was the younger sister of the famous actress, Julia Roberts, and accused her sister of being a bully and a bad person.
Motes took her own life in 2014 but she struggled with severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her husband, in which she blamed her mother and sisters for what had happened to her.
" His mother and his so--called siblings have nothing after him except the memory of the fact that they were the ones who caused his worst depression. "
Lea Michel was a star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying her co--stars on the set and abusing her star status.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunken driving in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
In 2010, she became the victim of unscrupulous computer hackers who posted pornographic images of her on the Internet.

Það is possible to put flowers on almost everything.
It enhances the development of children when they play in the garden with their parents and cultivate flowers and watch them grow.
It is also possible to do with flowers, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
It is only the time spent with the children in the garden that is never forgotten..
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and of course the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat after the tenth grade.
"There are not many fishermen who work in daycare centers in Norway, " says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who works as a fisherman during the summer but studies psychology at the University of Oslo during the winter.
Strandveiid is a very pleasant summer job when one is studying..
If the fishing is good, it is possible to earn a good income and it is fantastic to be able to give up the idea of taking a student loan.
The income from the summer is enough for him in the winter as well. " says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25- year old psychology student, who has been doing coastal fishing in the summer as well as in previous summers.
Axel was new to the dock at Tálknafjord when a newspaper reporter caught up with him late in the evening of the first week of the month.
"The winter he was in tenth grade, he took the boat captain's license for boats under 12 meters and bought his own boat the summer after graduating from high school.
He has been engaged in coastal fishing on his boat all summers since..
He bought the boat from a friend, named Hartmann Jonsson, and named the boat after him.
Hartmann was already an adult when he bought the boat and had stopped sailing, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after Axel took over the ship, and he bought the ship for three million.
" He made a contract with Hartmann to pay half of the money, one and a half million in the beginning of the summer and the other half in the end of the summer when he had finished fishing.
He had the boat free of debt at the end of his first summer on it.
In other words, a boy with one and a half million krones in his pocket was able to buy a boat when he had just finished high school..
"He had been working with his father at sea when he was a boy, he was out fishing with his father all summer and got his share.
He also put his confirmation money into his sailing fund.
Axel was born in Isafjord, where all his mother's family is from, but he has lived in Kopenhagen since he was a boy.
"I can hunt in the west of the country because he has a residence permit with his grandmother in Isafjord.
He learned to ride horses on this area in the west of the country with his father.
He travels between the fjords depending on how he feels, because this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although he prefers to fish in the west, he has also fished in the waters around the island of Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
He has also fished for salmon in the south, where he often talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky in the early hours of the morning..
"Netsamband out at sea is good, so that he can call, listen to radio broadcasts and listen to music.
It's no problem to be alone on a boat.
Naturally, he tries to avoid being in danger, but there have been occasional storms, but he has never suffered from sea sickness. " says Axel, who is lucky because he has never suffered from sea sickness.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes each time.
In fishing, he is never more than 14 hours at sea at a time,, but he has also been fishing in other quota systems,, for example in the leasing quota,, where he has been out at sea for one and a half days at a time fishing.
The arrangement for coastal fishing is such that he is allowed to catch 770 kilograms a day, which he finds hampering.
"Other restrictions are that he may not fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and that he can only fish for 12 days in a month during the four months of stranded fishing in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days based on weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to sail instead of having 48 days over the summer and being able to sail at their own discretion.
In the same way, the area division could also apply to him, and that the fishing stations located close to the fishing grounds should be allowed to profit from this,, says Axel, who mainly fishes with salmon on his coastal fishing trips, but also some other species float with him.
Axel works during the winter with his university studies at the Nupi kindergarten in Kópavog..
"There are not many sailors who work in the children's playgrounds of the country,, says Axel proudly and adds that he had only planned to work temporarily at the children's playground.
"He stayed there because he thought it was an amazing job.
He hopes that the psychology degree will be useful to him on the secondary school level in the future, says Axel, who is also a long way through a degree in business economics.
Villa in the register came in the way of the homecoming investigation.
The villa in the registration book that people fill out when they come to the country was the cause of the fact that a person who was living in the country was not called back for a re-examination.
There is no obligation to register if the person fills out the application in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be examined in the coming week, " says a specialist from the Department of Disease Prevention at the Ministry of Health.
Three domestic infections were detected in the virology department of the Landspitals on the previous day.
One of those who turned out to be positive arrived in the country on the 15th of July, two days after the introduction of the so-called homecoming quarantine..
Those who were búsetted in Iceland were screened upon their arrival to the country and again four to five days later.
In the afternoon news, RÚV reported that the person had followed the old system.
The screening at the border was negative and he was not called back for a second screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in the disease control department of the Ministry of Health, says in an interview with the news agency that this can be traced back to a flaw in the electronic registration passport.
Filling out the registration sheet in English is not a requirement to register, as it is in the Icelandic version..
It was first and foremost intended for foreign tourists.
This is because the person in question did not receive an automatic invitation to take part in the survey.
Kamilla says that many have followed the rules about homecomings, although they have filled the registration forms in English and in some cases, employers have also been aware of the need to send people back for a second test after they arrived in the country.
"This will be examined in the coming week, how it is possible to make it easier for people to gain access to this, to raise awareness of it. "
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all underwent a test, but two were showing symptoms.
Smitrakning is now in progress with the three smits detected on the previous day, but it is mostly completed due to the two smits detected on the previous day.
In both cases, DNA analysis by the Institute of Genetics at the University of Oslo has revealed that there is a new strain of the coronavirus that has not been found in Norway before.
In the other case, the bonds were directed to Israel, although it was known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries..
Kamilla says that it would be clear on the next day where the virus was coming from.
There are now 15 people in isolation according to the web site, Covid. is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four of the five infections are unrelated.
Five domestic infections have been reported in Norway in recent days.
The four are completely unrelated and, for example, have not been able to find the origin of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup athletics competition in the previous day.
Smitrakning is still ongoing.
Originally there were 30 individuals who were sent to isolation, they were reduced to 16.
In total, 34 are in quarantine due to the new infections that were detected the previous day.
This is the second time in a short period of time that an infection has been detected at an athletic event and has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jøhann K. Jøhannsson, head of the communications department at the Ministry of the Interior Police Directorate, says that it is possible, as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
" They are constantly urging all those who live in the area to carry out individual protective measures.
They also need to warn people who are organizing events that there are certain rules that must be followed..
Then it is possible to hold events,, says Johan.
He says that it is possible to prevent the spread of infection by raising awareness of individual infection prevention.
Rules and guidelines are constantly being revised.
"What needs to be done, and what the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health are constantly urging people to do,, is to take care of their individual sexually transmitted disease prevention.
Both at home and at the service company.
People wash their hands and use spray.
It prevents the spread of infection, " says Johan.
"They need to encourage people to continue on the good path they were on, in order to maintain the success they have achieved so far..
40 % of the victims of COVID 19 were suffering from diabetes 2.
Devon Brumfield heard through the telephone how difficult it was for her father to breathe.
Her father was suffering from diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was buried.
The death was attributed to sudden respiratory difficulties due to the coronavirus infection.
Sickle Cell Disease was listed on the death certificate as the underlying cause and Brumfield, who also has Sickle Cell Disease, is afraid that he will die for himself.
The Reuters news agency says that Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
The results of a new survey commissioned by US authorities show that nearly 40% of those who died were suffering from syphilis type 2, which is the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those under 65 is considered, the proportion rises to half.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) took to more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in infectious diseases at the CDC, says the results are striking, especially for those who have syphilis and their partners.
The number of births in the low birth rate countries is similar to the number of births in the high birth rate countries.
10 states, among which are California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet able to differentiate the underlying diseases.
"Sickle Cell Disease was in an epidemic at the time and was spreading rapidly.
In the meantime, the COVID - 19 has broken through as a powerful tsunami,, " according to Reuters, Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, which also suffered worse from the coronavirus.
The best protection for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease in check with physical exercise, a healthy diet and the help of health professionals.
The coronavirus epidemic has, however, made it difficult for many to maintain routine.
Then, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue to go to work and stopped them from being exposed to the virus..
Reuters reports that American authorities have been aware of the danger posed by the syphilis 2 virus.
In the SARS epidemic of 2003, more than 20% of those with the disease were affected, and in the swine flu epidemic of 2009, this group was three times more likely to be admitted to hospital.
When MERS became more prevalent in 2012, one study showed that 60 percent of those who died or were hospitalized had syphilis.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID 19 virus may last longer, the disease has stripped away the veil from a number of previously unknown complications.
" He fears that there will be a flood of problems when this is over, " says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the world association of diabetics.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus epidemic could indirectly lead to an increase in complications associated with syphilis, such as kidney disease and kidney failure.
There are new studies that suggest that the coronavirus could lead to an increase in cases of syphilis.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the connection between the coronavirus and syphilis.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weakened by syphilis.
Then, a high proportion of glucose and lipids among sycrosis sufferers can cause a true " bacterial storm " as it is called when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Damaged intracellular membranes can also lead to the formation of bubbles, which again can cause fatal blood clots.
"This is all one big jigsaw puzzle,, says Dela Cruz.
"It is all interconnected. "
The report has been corrected.
"They were offered champagne, then they left the room. "
The couple Åsrún Magnúsdottir and Atli Bollason received the unusual bonus from the painter Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was setting up in Paris.
"They loved each other so much that it was not complicated. "
Atli Bollason never forgets when he meets his wife and mother-in law, Åsrún Magnúsdottir, for the first time.
" He was very impressed by her.
It was natural that it was just the radiation,, but he also thought that she was so sexy that it was unbelievable..
It is still the case, he says.
Ásrún also remembers this, because her husband constantly reminds her of the first time they met.
"I's always hearing this story.
The last weekend,, she says, she was also attracted to her husband at first sight..
"I felt and still feels a lot of noise around Atle, which she likes..
There are a lot of things going on and a lot of things are happening and he was fascinated by it.
Atli says that the couple have emphasized the importance of going their own way in their relationship.
"They do not tie their baggage to the same knot as their fellow travellers.
In the past, they avoided routines that they observed around them.
It is possible that this is the reason why they took the offer from Ragnar Kjartansson, the musician, with great enthusiasm,, though it was quite unusual.
"Kirsten Anna's common friend has contacted them and asked if they could come to eat dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg, at Snaps. "
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and one each after dinner.
They listened to Ragnar as he led them through his plans for a painting exhibition he planned to set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
"He had a film called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way.
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he wanted to shoot and at the end, he told them that he wanted to know whether they were interested in taking part. "
Senan, who Ragnar asked to take part in, was to show young middle- class couples how to love in a minimalistic room.
"This is a meeting of the beginning and the end, " Atli says.
Parið þekkted Ragnar little, though they had known of him and he of them " but they knew them and thought they fitted in.
They said that they did not want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who were sexually frustrated because they had to perform for others.
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take long.
"When they walked out of Snap, they said, " We're only in this for a short time. "
It was just like that.
Eg trusted Ragnar as an artist and the whole team he had. " says Åsrún and Atli agree.
"This is about love and intimacy "
Senan was taken up in a fine apartment in Myrargate.
There was a very small film crew, the director, Ragnar and the sound man and the couple.
After the recording was started, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
"They didn't know what they were going to do.
They received some instructions, but they tried to forget time and place.
To be unaware of what they were doing and for whom.
It was not played, they just loved each other, so it was not complicated. " says Åsrún.
En was romantic.
" Yes, it was a little romantic, " says Atli and Åsrún agrees.
"They were offered champagne before they left the room..
It was like being on holiday in a luxurious hotel in Paris.
The team was pleased with the couple's performance in the play that moved them.
"When Tommi the cameraman saw it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful. " says Atli.
" It's just as much about love and intimacy as it is about the actual sex itself. "
The couple's parents have seen the play and Atli says that his mother heard the voice of his son at the National Theatre in Reykjavik and then realized that he was part of the play.
"Then she turns around and starts to think about it,, " Atli says.
"Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
They had not said anything like this to anyone, but he sent a letter to his father saying that he had met the little family at the Palais de Tokyo.
And the participation in the work has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atle.
"They are still together, maybe even more than before..
That deepened his relationship with his extended family,, says Åsrún and laughs.
Sjalf worked with his colleagues in Copenhagen.
"It was difficult for her to be with someone other than her husband,, " she says and turns to her husband.
"It was fun to see this, because it is only one scene in a larger work, and when it is seen with the other works, it is very impressive.
He was able to pull himself away from it and was proud.
There was a little baby in her belly at the time,, says Åsrún, who was pregnant with her second child when the scene was filmed.
"It was just beautiful. "
Anna Marsibil Clausen was interviewed by Åsrūn and Atla on RAS 1.

Ambassadorless for five years from 2009.
Jeffery Gunter Ross, the American ambassador to Iceland, is in the limelight after CBS reported in the morning that he wanted to have armed bodyguards because he feared for his life.
It has not always been easy for the President of the United States to appoint ambassadors to Norway..
From April 2009, when Carol Van Voorst resigned as US ambassador to Norway,, the country has been without an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned from office under unusual circumstances,, but in 2009, Kastljos reported that she had been nominated for the Order of the Falcon.
On the way to the farewell ceremony with the President, she received a telephone call from the President's office that she would not be awarded the Order.
After she left Iceland, she became acquainted with international relations at the Army War College.
Six months passed until Van Voorst's successor came into office in September 2010.
It is to some extent due to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador, but then resigned.
In the course of his work, Louis Ariega had worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for more than a decade.
He resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
This was followed by a second period without a diplomatic representative.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015 and took up his post shortly afterwards, with no ambassador having been stationed in the country for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but was not a diplomat, having worked as a lawyer and campaign fundraiser for Barack Obama.
He resigned as ambassador on 20 January 2017, the same day that Donald Trump took office as president.
The Trump administration was unusually long in appointing both ambassadors and high--ranking officials in the Washington government..
Two years later, the United States Congress called Jeffrey Ross Gunter to its meeting to appoint him as the United States ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony to the parliament, he said that he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, and that his wife, who is deceased, was of Norwegian descent.
Gunter is politically appointed and was previously a plastic surgeon in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Sheldon Adelson, the owner of Spilavit, founded the organization, but Adelson is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, when no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months.
The reason for this is both the length of time it took for Trump to appoint people to key positions and the fact that, over the past few years, the work of the United States Congress has dragged on, including the appointment of ambassadors.
Since 2009, the embassy has been without an ambassador in Iceland for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the embassy from carrying out construction work on its new headquarters at Engjateig, which opened in 2008.
The construction is said to have cost around 65 million euros, and the building is surrounded by bulletproof walls and bulletproof glass in all the windows.
However, this is not enough to satisfy the current ambassador's security concerns, he is said to fear for his life and has asked for armed bodyguards.
A former player of ÍBV was subjected to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland "
Tonny Mawejje, former player of ÍBV, says that he was subjected to racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This comes from an interview with Tonny, which was published in the Ugandan newspaper Daily Monitor.
Tonny joined the Ugandan Police team recently. the team plays in the top division of Uganda.
In an interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Norway, where he played for ÍBV, Val and Þrótti.
"When he came to Iceland, he did not play in the midfield as he was used to..
Fyrirliði of the team was in that position, but he was also wearing the jersey number that he wanted, so he did not get either of them. " said Tonny but he played on the right wing during the season with ÍBV.
Among other things, Tonny talks about the racism he experienced in Norway.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
"This happened to him once, but because he did not understand the language, he ignored what was said to him..
Later,, he learned of the case and asked his friend what it was about.
He told him that his opponent had made racist remarks about him after he tackled him.
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
He says he made the mistake that he regrets the most.
Tommie had not managed to break into the starting line-up at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to qualify for the national team.
He then asked to be loaned back to Ísland but he then went to play for Val.
"It was a mistake to return to Iceland on loan.
He held that if he had stayed longer in Norway, he would have received the opportunity he wanted, "Tonn said, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would go further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland made it impossible for him to fulfill his dreams of playing in a big club in Europe.
A worm was found in a woman's throat.
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 inch long black worm in the throat of a woman who was admitted to the hospital.

Research led to the conclusion that a parasitic organism was involved.
CNN reports this.
Kona had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the tapeworm was removed, but tapeworms are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi became popular in Western countries, the number of cases where parasitic worms have infected people has increased, according to CNN.

Confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University's count, and deaths attributed to the virus have reached 644,000.
Mosaic work by Gerða is finally given its due.
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavik, there is a large and deep hole.
Above them are men wearing orange helmets..
There is also a large excavator.
and more of the smaller work vehicles.
The road is closed for traffic.
The gangway is wide and there are now many people standing there and admiring the millions of mosaic pieces that make up the artwork., which they have never seen before.
They may have never seen it before.
At least, he did not see it for himself.
It has been hidden up until now, it was in front of it, there were parking spaces that were always occupied.
People left their cars locked in a hurry and rushed off to their assignments in the city center.
" Lively and diverse public space " and " attractive cityscape " are the guiding principles for the reconstruction of the Tryggvagate.
The goal is to improve the appearance of the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerda Helgadottir at the Tollhouse to be seen better.
In front of the construction site, a square and the area where it is well exposed to the sun is considered to be suitable as a rest area for travellers.
The sculpture is lit up and is now able to be seen more clearly on the 142 square metres of space.
In the area, there are also small " mists of water sculptures, a kind of water sculptures that offer play and provide the area with a certain mysticism.
In this way, the renovations are described by the municipality of Reykjavik as being carried out in conjunction with Veitum.
The water, heat and electricity supply networks are to be renewed.
Many of them are over 100 years old, but the sewage pipeline and cold water pipeline were built in 1925 and have therefore served the residents and businesses in the city centre for nearly a century..
When the road is reopened after the completion of the works, cars can be driven on it again.
However, it is a one--way street, and as a result, it creates more peaceful and accessible spaces for pedestrians..
In the history of the Tollhouse on the toll office's website, it says that the building was opened in 1971 and was designed by Gisle Halldorsen.
Because the ship hit the house, there was a 250 square metre wall of windowless wall facing the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a flat surface would have a negative impact on the overall cityscape, unless special measures were taken to enhance the appearance of the building.
The parties agreed that it would be appropriate to erect a permanent monument there.
At this time, there was a lot of talk about Gerði Helgadottir, the artist, in the summary..
She had worked on many mosaic projects in Germany and elsewhere.
AFRaradi was to have first contact with her before deciding whether a competition would be held for the work.
Often there had been discussions about the need to reflect life at the harbor, since the harbor had been the lifeblood of Reykjavik since it was built.
When the artist was interviewed, she became fascinated by the work.
It was agreed that she would receive sketches and other assistance before she left the country,, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
