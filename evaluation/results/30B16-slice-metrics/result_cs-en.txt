Slavia promised Berbrovi a million for the title, Tvrdik denied it.
In the current corruption case, it was alleged that the former president of the Football Association of Romania, Roman Berbr had received a million korun from Slavia for the league title in the 2018-19 season.
It was reported by the football magazine, efotbal, that it had received a part of the police's files.
The president of the club, Jaroslav Tvrdik stated that there was no corruption in the club.
The server revealed police recordings in which Slavia's former sporting director, Jan Nezmar,, who left the club in the summer of 2010, was a central figure.
The former influential member of the Communist Party was in frequent contact with both Berbrem and the former sports director of the second division Vyšehrad Romanem Rogozem, who is involved in the case.
Criminalists apparently worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi promised financial compensation for winning the title.
In 2019, Slavia won the first league title.
The police organization was informed that, after winning the league,, Roman ( Berbr ) was given a one million euro bonus by the Slavia club's executives.
On the day after,, according to the criminalists,, Berbr also met with Nejmare and the president of the Slavie Tvrdiik football club.
The information from the spy is still unclear, whether the police are still using this information.
Tvrdik rejected all forms of corruption.
In the years 2015 to 2017, they actively tried to change the structure of Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
Tvrdic said that the club had not been involved in any illegal activity, that they had not attempted to influence the decisions of the referees and that they had not received any financial compensation in relation to the incident.
In contrast, Nezmar and some other former players of Slavia have also criticized their former coach Tvrdi..
In October 2011, a police raid on several locations, including the FAČR headquarters in Bucharest, took place.
The most prominent figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football activities.
In the middle of January, the former director of the Vyšehrad stadium, Rogoz, was released from custody.

This is the biggest problem of the whole pandemic..
He had to deal with the fact that he was suffering from a very dangerous disease for a short time,, but he managed to overcome it without major problems.
It is difficult to cope with the fact that a large part of the population, from all its layers,, has been in a state of idiocy for a long time. This is still a problem.

It should have been more dramatic.
The number of people between the ages of 35 and 40 who have no sex throughout the year has increased.
More and more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
The main focus is on the religiously- inclined people, according to the Daily Mail.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of people aged between 35 and 44 who were sexually active decreased from 8 to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35, who said that the number of sexual encounters in the last year was more than in the previous year.
The decline in the number of sexually active individuals is also influenced by other factors, revealed by a survey conducted by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them is the economic consequences of the epidemic of the coronavirus and the higher percentage of unemployment.
It was also possible that the presence of media and social media, such as pornography and video, made sex with men of lesser importance and less priority for young people.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who have had no sex in the previous year has increased. "
In married couples, sexual activity is more frequent, in 2021, only 5 % of them stated that they had not been sexually active in the previous year.
In the 29 % of the free people, Stone added that marriage in the age of less than 35 is only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also due to the fear of the pre-marital relationship and the religious background.
However, in married couples, it is more likely that they are sexually active, that the percentage of married couples and married couples aged between 35 and 35 years is still decreasing.
Young people's views on premarital sex are divided, about 30 % believe that it is a bad thing and about 70 % believe that it is normal.
"The truth is that among the free individuals in this age group, there are a minority, but their behaviour is pushing the trend. " says Stone about the 30 percent of the population.
Most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex are motivated by their religious beliefs.
Since 2008, the number of young people between 35 and 40 years of age who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to more than 60 percent.
Among the " less believers " the trend rose from 10 to 20 % .
The decline in sexual activity is also influenced by other factors,, such as less social interaction and mainly alcohol consumption during the period of the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex was lower among people without jobs or those with lower income.
The second reason is the expansion of the digital media, which is likely to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time on the internet, as a result of which this need is replaced.
This trend was most pronounced during the lockdown during the period of the pandemic of the coronavirus.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, it is necessary for the society to force a part of the population to behave in a way that they do not want,, but which can save their lives.
It is a relatively difficult question, one of the most important issues of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether, if they are not allowed to die and they die,, it is their fault.
His argument is that the deaths of the 80- year old people were caused by a lack of understanding of what they were doing and a lack of understanding of what they were doing. As a result, they did not know what they were doing and eventually died.
On the other side, he does not believe that the death of the opponent of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia, who was persecuted by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia, was caused by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia.
From these statistics, it is clear that the vast majority of unvaccinated old people belong to the second group, which means that they are able to take care of themselves.

The government of Prime Minister Andreje Babiše is at the end of the law that would have ensured respect for the interests of towns and their inhabitants in the selection and approval of deep underground radioactive waste..

The powers of the local authorities to decide on the use of the land are to be strengthened from 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which demands a Czech nuclear law and European directive.
The new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, intends to reorganize in cooperation with the cities.
Minister Karla Havlicić's proposed law, which is based on the Platform's platform, does not meet the demands of the cities and the public in the process of choosing a location for the construction of a nuclear power plant.
In reality, it can be effective only when the city or the public can influence the continuation of the process in that locality.
To be able to obtain the approval of the local authorities, the authorities in charge of the site had to ask for the approval of the local authorities before the commencement of the specific operation.

In the draft, there is a lack of a system of compensation for the villages for the entire process of searching and selection of the location for the landfill and its approval and operation.
The leaders of the villages, in reality, do not have much possibilities to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place to settle.
Only in some jurisdictions, they are allowed to submit their complaints or to appeal,, but the decision is made by the court or the minister.
The pending lawsuit has no impact on the conduct of surveying or construction work.

The Platform for the Protection of Underground Nuclear facilities is composed of 51 members ( 35 towns and cities and 16 associations ) for the purpose of promoting changes in the state's handling of radioactive debris and other radioactive waste that are not limited to underground nuclear facilities.
The Platform also proposes that the decision on the location of the storage site was dependent on the prior consent of the affected communities.
