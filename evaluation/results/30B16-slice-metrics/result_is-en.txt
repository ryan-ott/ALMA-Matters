Þetta is all replayed here as an introduction to the newest form of government in Iceland, " shadow government " .
Þar where the word is used in the language, it is not clear that it has been defined to the end, but it seems that the following definition is " the most common " . The shadow leadership is when the leader of a trade union says in the press that he intends to send representatives of the union to the board of the welfare fund in order to take a stand on a particular issue.
Ef they fail to follow the orders, they are killed and expelled from the government at the first opportunity.
Ef the foremost man does not use this in the media and does not talk about resignation, but it is not a " shadow leadership " because there are always contact between people in the financial world and other places.

The Olympic Games end with the lighting of the Olympic flame at the end of the track.
is.
Afreksfólk have an extra year to prepare for the Olympics and the Japanese authorities have increased funding for the postponement.
All of them hold on to the idea that they have a lot of money in the house.
The announcement that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympic Games in 1964 was met with enthusiasm by the Japanese delegation.
Þeir grreted and shouted to celebrate the end of the Games, which were held in London in 2012, but were held in a lower level than the 2008 Games in Beijing, China.
I in this time, Tokyo and Japan attracted the attention of the world.
23 July 2021 to 8 August 2021.
Ef it is not possible to hold the Olympic Games, if the coronavirus is still a major threat, the threat of the Olympic Games is halted.
Enginn wants to think the thought to the end.
The Olympic Games are not a normal athletics competition.
Ekkert has been spent on the production, the show is designed to be spectacular and is aimed at surpassing the previous production.
Valið on a city for the Olympic Games is based on the judgement of the selection committee on the presentation of the cities.
is Því the advertisement is more impressive, the likelihood of success is greater.
150 million dollars were used to try to hold the Olympic Games in 2016, equivalent to about 20 million Norwegian krones.
In the second time,, when the Olympic Games were held in 2020,, 75 million dollars and 10 million krone were spent on the promotion.
The 2013 decision to award the 2012 Olympic Games to Tokyo resulted in the Japanese government allocating 30 million krone to the project.
is. The amount is only a drop in the ocean compared to the amount needed to build the Olympic village, the Olympic stadium and to strengthen the infrastructure of the country to be able to hold the Olympics, to prepare for the Olympics and to hold the Olympics themselves.
126 million dollars were estimated to have been spent on the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, which were postponed from 2008 to 2009 due to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.
100 million dollars were spent in 1990, 200 million dollars in 1991, and 300 million dollars in 1992.
Likely it would not be possible to assess the cost of postponing the matches, but it was estimated that it would cost between two and six million dollars in addition to the original cost.
Heildarkcosts for the Japanese Olympic Committee and the Japanese government were estimated to be between 15 and 30 million dollars.
Það is a huge amount of money that has been spent by the Norwegian government for the 2004 Olympic Games, compared to the lowest possible cost..
The Olympic Games are events of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of scrutiny by economists, who have examined the impact of the games in terms of profit and benefit.
In short, it appears that the impact of the Olympic Games on the economies of the cities that host them is less than favourable.
In some cases, there is a large increase in the number of jobs for a short period of time,, but in the long term, the cities are often characterized by high unemployment and low operating costs of man-made structures.
The city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil is in dire financial straits because of the 2016 Olympics and has struggled to maintain all of the large athletic facilities that were built for the games.
10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
is Það þýðs that there was no talk of new jobs, except at a small level.
In general, cities have not come out well financially from hosting the Olympics due to the huge costs associated with building facilities for the games.
e.g. the increase in the number of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities in the wake of the Olympic Games,, which is uncertain due to the upcoming Olympic Games in 2021.
Einnig, it is unclear whether it is possible to accommodate all the thousands of spectators who normally attend the games.
The most important thing is the honour that the boroughs are awarded for being chosen,, but it is difficult to assess the amount of money.
Því despite the enormous cost, it is also possible to say that the joy that the actors bring is not of the same type as that which can be attributed to the actors.
þough the show is often spectacular, there is no shortage of money, it is clear that it is not just about money.
Þa it is the athletes who are in the foreground.
Fyrir some of the athletes, the postponement of the games was unprecedented.
2008, 2010 and 2012, she won gold medals in the 200m freestyle, 100m freestyle and 400m freestyle at the 2008, 2010 and 2012 Olympic Games. 2008, 2010 and 2012, she won gold medals in the 200m freestyle, 100m freestyle and 400m freestyle at the 2008, 2010 and 2012 Olympic Games. 2008, 2010 and 2012, she won gold medals in the 200m freestyle, 100m freestyle and 400m freestyle at the 2008, 2010 and 2012 Olympic Games. 2008, 2010 and 2012, she won gold medals in the 200m freestyle, 10
Hún is one of the athletes who is more satisfied with the postponement, for reasons that are understandable..
Fyrir those athletes who had planned to retire after the Olympics in 2008, the postponement of the games in some cases caused them to retire before the games started.
e. He does not feel that his body is strong enough to go through another year of strenuous training.
Few athletes made themselves known to the audience at the Olympic Games in Rio in 2016, and the fencing star Simone Biles.
Hún came home with four gold medals and one bronze.
Biles has appeared in several interviews in her home country of the United States to talk about the Olympic Games.
Hún ætalled to participate in the 2021 Olympics, but she was not sure that she would be on top of the podium at the 2012 Olympics. She was 24 years old at that time.
Þótt it is not generally considered to be a high age, it is in the first place for a female athlete in the first rank.
" This is a sensitive issue, " Biles said, but added that she is still interested in competing at the 2016 Olympics.
" It is hard to say whether he is on top of the world after a year of training in addition to training. "
I has previously said that her body is not able to withstand the stress that comes with training for a long period of time.
2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, 2012 and 2013, 2014 and 2015 and 2016 and 2017 and 2018 and 2019 and 2020 and 2021 and 2022 and 2023 and 2024 and 2025 and 2026 and 2027 and 2028 and 2029 and 2030 and 2031 and 2032 and 2033 and 2034 and 2035 and 2036 and 2037 and 2038 and 2039 and 2040 and 2041 and 2042 and 2043 and 2044 and 2045 and 2046 and 2047 and 2048 and 2049 and 205
Biles says that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop training when the 2008 Olympic Games were at their peak and the Olympic swimming pool was closed.
The only exceptions were Biles,, who was allowed to compete while all other athletes were banned for seven weeks.
is = All of her Olympic gold medals were lost, she had to find a number of ways to keep herself in shape like other athletes.
The basic form is, in fact, better than with most people.
