He also stated that people who have weak immune systems may be able to transmit the disease more easily than those who have strong immune systems.
He explained that the strain of the virus, " Ockmion " could be dangerous.
The cause of the disease is unknown.
The scientists believe that the bacterium originated in a tele infected with the bacterium VICch. or in a tele with a deficient immune system.
He did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
He scored more aggressively.
When he realized that the immune system had not responded to him, he became very aggressive.
It is believed that there are more than 100,000 of them, that their antibodies have not undergone mutations during the mutations and that their antibodies have not undergone mutations during the mutations.
In the case of people with a weak immune system, they are able to transmit the disease more easily than those with a strong immune system.
The strong response of the organism to any infection is not always beneficial.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This happens when young people between 30 and 60 years old are infected with pneumonia, older people between 30 and 60 years old are infected with pneumonia.
The immune response of young people is completely inadequate, it is only possible to shoot at birds with cannons. - concluded Sergey Purosev.
In addition, Rac also mentioned that the coronavirus has dangerous symptoms and the most dangerous of them is pneumonia.
Bacterial and viral infections are the most common.
If the first treatment is successful and quickly, in the second case, the symptoms are often only symptoms of the organism.
The first symptoms of pneumonia are the onset of intoxication of the organism, which is characterized by high temperatures, weakness and lack of energy.
The respiratory symptoms are difficulty in breathing and coughing in the throat and chest.
Pain to the left or to the right of the abdomen may be indicative of a developing problem.
At the end of the year,, in Russia, young people between the ages of 12 and 18 can be vaccinated.
