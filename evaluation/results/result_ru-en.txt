Germany - The fourth wave of the coronavirus is unavoidable.
The fourth vaccination is required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
In the opinion of experts, the current vaccination in Germany is not conclusive and continues with new strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of vaccine from the coronavirus are unlikely to provide full protection.
In this assured leader of the Association of publicly practicing doctors Ulrich Wagefeldt.
On the 11th of December, Die Welt reported on this.
They expect that the fourth vaccination is needed in the summer, the latest in the autumn. - according to the expert.
In addition to this, Vaigelldt believes that the fourth vaccination from the coronavirus can be carried out " in conjunction with a vaccination from the flu.
This helps to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus " Omicron.
The new variant is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the likelihood of re-- infection with the " Omicron " strain is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of the preliminary research conducted in South Africa.
As a result of this, the producers of BioNTech and Pfizer planned to release a vaccine adapted to the Omikron in March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against the new variant of the coronavirus " Omicron .
The research of BioNTech and Pfizer showed that the effectiveness of the two doses of the vaccine decreased by more than 25 times.
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection from infection with the omicron strain - emphasized BioNTich and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
The experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, president of the German Society of Infectious Diseases Bernd Salzberger advocates shortening the interval between the second and third vaccination.
In addition,, according to Salzberger, the accelerated vaccination has an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel is very convincingly demonstrates this, - emphasized the expert.
Blobber Pontoon 21, Bet- A Vib, 54 Silent, 8.5 g.
The Bet A series is a special branch of the Bet A series from the company Pontoon 21.
Ona ( as well as the series Kalikana Vib ) is different from many other fishes in that it was originally created with the intention of being used for underwater fishing.
These animals are larger than their close relatives, have a higher density, which has a positive impact on the use of these interesting playthings..
The other well--known feature is the upper plastic plate, made of hard and elastic plastic, which produces additional vibrations when it is played vertically or horizontally.
As a " winter fish " when fishing in the distant Beta Vib, it demonstrates a very aggressive game.
Most often, the most captivating animation is simple and monotonous, consisting of movement up and down almost without pauses.
Planning for deviation from vertical axis that is not very large, which is convenient for fishing in confined underwater vegetation, rocks and other obstacles.
In addition, there is a small deviation in catching salmon and large trout, and especially in the middle of the winter, when a precise and aggressive throwing of the lure is required.
Reaching the furthest points of their trajectories, the Beta- Vib immediately unfolds and returns to their initial vertical position.
Bait A. Vib is equally successful for winter salmon fishing in fishing ponds..
In order to satisfy her whims, two modifications are available, with or without the noise capsule ( NS - Nano Sound ) or without it ( SL – Silent ) .
It is also noted that the Bet- A Vib game is capable of disrupting passive ducks that do not react even to the presence of a live duck.

For lobster, sturgeon, eel and pike, as well as irregular and " staggering " movements. sometimes with " chirping " on the bottom.
If they are caught in enclosed areas, they can be changed from a triplet to a doublet, which reduces the likelihood of capture.
Among his peers, Bet A Vib is one of the most durable and, as a result, one of the most durable.
With equal success, it can be used on relatively small areas as well as on relatively deep areas.
All the models are equipped with the Owner St.36 hooks.

" Examples of successes - " in Syria they defended and restored peace there, " the decision on " Northern Stream 2 " and " the whole world was frightened by the most powerful weapons and the Crimean peninsula was seized. "
The main failures are the conflict with Ukraine, the confrontation with Western countries and the isolation from the world.
The government of Dubai has completely rejected the printing industry - all government services also became only computerized.
The Government of Dubai announced its complete withdrawal from the printing industry and the transition to the use of computer technology.

The transition to an electronic government and the computerization of documents began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, that amounted to 14 million hours of human labour and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
The former mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobiyenin said that electronic services cost citizens 2 days a year.

Production and export of cars in Turkey fell below the 2020 level.
Production and export of cars in Turkey fell sharply in November due to the decline of the lira.
In the result of the 11 months of 2011, the industry's results were worse than those of the previous year, according to Bloomberg, citing the results of the Association of Romanian automobile producers.
According to the associations, in November, 115,000 cars were produced in Turkey, 20 percent less than the previous year.
About 759,000 machines were exported, a decrease of more than 25 percent compared to the previous year.
In the first 10 months of 2012, the automobile sector of Romania demonstrated a positive dynamism compared to the previous year, and by the end of the 11 months of 2012, the production of aircraft was 0.3 percent lower than the previous year.
The cause of this decline was the rapid decline of the Turkish lira, which fell by 29 percent in relation to the dollar in November.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 members of the MSB received postponement of payment in 2021.
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smajlovic spoke about the situation with the provision of privileges for small and medium businesses, reported by MIA " Kosinform " correspondent.
According to information from the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the regulation and development of the financial market, in the year 2021, in fulfillment of the orders of the heads of state from 1 April 2021, the President of the Agency issued a decree on 9 April 2021 No. 127 " on the approval of the order for the provision of postponed payments for small and medium businesses.
He reminded that the procedure for granting postponement of payments from contracts issued before April 1, 2021 was to be given to institutions and organizations conducting microfinance activities, including IPs, between April 1 and June 30, 2021.
The period of suspension ranged from 30 to 90 days, depending on the choice of the MSCB.
In the announcement, it was stated that the deadline for the payment of compensation could be postponed.
In the period of the suspension of employment, the employment contracts were suspended, the announcement of the need to repay the overdue debt and other payments were made, and the commission of creditors and other payments were made.

A pulmonologist, Pulurasev, suggested that people with a weak immune system are able to easily carry the strain of " streptococcus " .
The doctor suggested that people with weak immune systems may be more susceptible to the disease than those with strong immune systems.
Pulmonologist Sergey Purosev explained that the strain of the coronavirus " Omicron " could be dangerous.
The cause of the infection is to be found in the conditions in which the virus is born.
Scientists believe that " HIV " originated in infected tissue or in a person suffering from immune deficiency.
In other words, the mutation did not meet any resistance from the immune system.
He became more aggressive.
Because of the lack of an immune response, he became very fast.
Apparently, there are more of these spike proteins and sharps than are allowed in the mutations, their antibodies have not been eliminated during the mutations - commenteered by pneumologist Sergey Puurasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weak immune systems may be able to transmit HIV more easily than those with strong immune systems.
It turns out that the strong response of the organism to anything, to any infection - is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
In the case of pneumonia caused by pneumococcus, when young people between 30 and 60 years old die, old people between 60 and 60 years old die in the form of pneumonia.
The immune response of young bears is completely inadequate, they can only scratch with their claws, but they shoot like cannons at woodpeckers - concluded Sergey Purowarasev.
Rac also pointed out that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is caused by bacterial and viral infections.
If the first treatment is very successful and quick, in the second case, the symptoms can be cured only partially - all hope for the organism.
The first sign of the developing pneumonia is the onset of intoxication of the organism - this is indicated by the temperature and weakness, lack of strength.
Afterwards, respiratory symptoms occur, such as difficulty breathing, breathing in the throat and coughing.
Pain on the right or left side of the abdomen may also be indicative of a developing problem.
By the end of 2012, Russia could begin to vaccinate the underage population from 12 to 18 years old.
The virologist and director of the genetic engineering laboratories at the Romanian Institute of Physics and Astronomy, Pavel Volchins said that this category is very vulnerable to the disease.
The number of interactions between young people who go to school is the highest..
This is the most socially active group,, as well as children from children's schools,, said Pavle Volchins,, a virologist and head of the genetic engineering laboratory at the Institute of Physics and Technology.

Teath in.
In the distant 1970s and 1980s, no dance floor was without the music of this group.
At home, they gathered with friends and staged dances to their music.
The immunologist proposed the hypothesis that people with immune deficiency become victims of the disease.
The authors studied the tissue left from bariatrics operations and found that liver cells, known as adipocytes, could be infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells, located in the glandular tissue, macrophages, were also infected and exhibited a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the tissue of patients who died from the disease and found particles of the coronavirus in the tissue surrounding various organs.
It is known that viruses such as HIV and grippe can hide in cellular tissue, using it as a reservoir in attempts to avoid the immune system.
Possibly, SARS- CoV 2.
The biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Gološeićin named the causes of dementia and described the methods of its prophylaxis in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to the World Health Organization, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome manifests itself gradually as the ability to orientate in familiar surroundings becomes increasingly difficult.
More often than not, dementia is caused by neurodegenerative diseases, injuries to the head, some infections and metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, increased levels of cholesterol, obesity and alcoholism.
On a behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and the absence of active cognitive activity are possible. - he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by bad habits such as smoking, excessive use of alcohol, irregular sleep patterns and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first symptoms, the experts noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in abstract thinking.
There is a discussion that loss of hearing can be one of the early manifestations of Alzheimer's disease, or one of the factors that increases the risk of its emergence - the biologist added.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical strength, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously professor of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics at the University of Bucharest.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the department of cognitive impairments at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolekova described the causes of memory impairment.
Egypt returned about 30,000 artefacts illegally removed from the country.
In the last 10 years, the government of Cairo managed to return 30,000 artefacts illegally exported from the country.
He said in an interview with the television channel Al--Hayat on 11 December,, the chief inspector of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Ghawaad.

According to his words, one of the recovered artefacts was found in the ancient skeleton of a human who is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bronze bust of King Tutankhamun, which was auctioned in London.
The auction house Christie's held an auction on 4 July, during which a 3,000- year old bust was sold for $5.97 million ( approximately 680 million rupees ).
This caused discontent in Egypt.
The Egyptian side also asserts that artifacts were illegally removed from the Carnarian temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamon, depicted in the form of the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and was not displayed on the market until 1985.
The manner in which relics arrived in Europe is unknown.
Egypt in the last years has actively pursued the repatriation of ancient artefacts illegally removed from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the ancient artefacts are the result of archaeological excavations by " black diggers " .

The last year of Sergei Eseinin's life (1925) was productive in terms of his creative work, but the most difficult for his life as a poet and his " ego.
He has not been a member of any literary organizations, he has distanced himself from imaginism, but he is well- known, popular and sometimes harshly criticized by critics, but he is widely accepted by the reading public.
More than 60 poems were written during the year, many of them were genuine masterpieces and the cycle of " Persian themes " was completed with the publication of the poem " Anna Snyagin " and eight books were published in the collection " Soviet Russia ".
The main achievement was in the end of June 2005, the state publishing company signed a contract with the Ministry of Culture to publish his works in three volumes.
None of the modern Sergey Alexanderovic poets have achieved this honor. he was the first to do so.
At the same time, this was a very lucrative contract, with a monthly salary of 1000 roubles for 20 months ( the director of the factory received 300 roubles a month, the engineer 200 ).
In the year 2009, they were needed as never before.
Eseinin married the niece of Leo Tolstoy, Sofya Tolstoy, and had to take care of his sisters Kata and Sasha, as well as his mother.
In the meantime, life has been reestablished, there is something to celebrate, but for him, everything is colored in dark tones, like a nightmare from the poems " Black Man " ( written in November 1925 and published after his death ) .
His friend, his friend.
He is very and very ill.
I don't know where the big came from.

It is as if the sun rises in September.
Alcohol burns the brain.
Many of his acquaintances noted that Eseinin was severely weakened, poorly appeared and was clearly ill.
More and more breakdowns and nervous breakdowns.
and probably not only in alcoholism.
On the other hand, the diagnosis of alcoholism given by Sergey Alexander Kem was not confirmed by reliable documents.
In 1923, Eseinin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Aisdorea Duncan, improved his health in a clinic in Paris, under the supervision of Professor Peter Gannanish. Two years later, Eseinin met him again in Moscow.
However, there are witnesses to the poet's scandals on this occasion, scattered across dozens of memoirs.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a terrible romantic poet with a green dragon emerged rapidly.
In the late autumn of 1923, Eseinin lived for a short time with the painter Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, despite his high income, he never had his own house in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, and he lived in rented apartments, in guesthouses or with friends.
"In 1992, the Romanian Ministry of Defense, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
He only stayed overnight, and in the majority of cases in a drunken and intoxicated state.
One day, returning home at four in the morning, Eseinin fell from the staircase landing.
Padaiya cut his own face and blew his throat.
When he regained consciousness, he began coughing and spitting all over the floor.

"The only things he saw there were cabaret houses and streets.

According to the first partial results announced in the afternoon of 12 December, most of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted in favor of independence during the referendum.
On the other hand, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 35.1 percent (27,55 people) voted for independence from France, while 96.49 percent (75 762 people ) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90 percent, more than 80,000 inhabitants of New Caledonia took part in the elections.
The outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubts, as the proponents of independence called on the electors not to participate in the voting.
The initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on 12 December, considering that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago made it impossible to conduct a full--fledged and " honest " pre-- election campaign.
As a result, the third victory of French New Caledonia after referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 percent of the population voted against independence, in 2020, 53.3 percent.
The separatists said that they did not recognize the results of the last election and opposed them in the UN.
As announced on 12 December in the Elysian Palace, President of France Emmanuel Macron would announce the results of the referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence was revived in the last two weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several candidates for the presidency spoke in favor of the territory remaining part of France, because it is " the last remaining territory of the European Union in the Pacific Ocean.
" New Caledonia must remain French " - repeatedly repeated by Eric Zemmur.
The same announcement was made by candidate from the Republicans, Valerie Pecreaux, who in the end of October published a column in Le Figaro calling on Caledonians to remain French.
On his side, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position because it was not his responsibility.
Nevertheless, the president added: " France would have been less beautiful without New Caledonia.
Prime Minister Jean Castecs, on his side, expressed a " strong desire for the election of the Caledonians to be held in France. "

Ukraine begins to produce the new generation of reactive unmanned aerial vehicles.
On the new Ukrainian- Turkish factory, began to create reactive unmanned aerial vehicles ( BPLA ) type Anka.
On 11 December, deputy chief of staff of the President of Romania, Alexei Arestis said.
They are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other unmanned aircraft.
Even against aircraft piloted.
The planes will be equipped with Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish aviation. - citing his dialogue with Ua.
Commenting on the main features of the Ankas and Arestovich aircraft, he said that they are reactive and not piston-- powered.
According to his words, this new generation of unmanned aircraft after the Bayraktar is superior to it in all aspects.
The first batch of BPLA would be produced at the end of the following year, concluded Arestovich.
The aerial vehicle Anka was created by the Turkish aerocosmic agency in February 2014.
The development of the unmanned aircraft began in 2010 in collaboration with several private companies.
The Romanian General Staff revealed details of the use of the Bayraktar and Javelin missiles in military operations conducted by the combined forces in the Donbass.
On 6 December, President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky announced that construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern unmanned aircraft began in the country.
According to his words, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Romanian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement for the construction of a training center in the region of Bucharest, in which Romanian personnel would be trained, as well as the testing and maintenance of the Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The press office of the Ukrainian leader called the memorandum " a major realistic step forward.
At the airport, two lions escaped from a container.
In the Indonesian airport of Changang, lions were stolen.
According to The Straits Times,.
The two hunters managed to escape from the container with seven lions, arriving on one of the planes.
It is not known from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the fugitive lions climbed onto the roof of the container.
The animals were not able to escape from him because of the set of protective fences that were set up around him..
The antagonism ended after the arrival of the staff of the Mandai Wildlife Group, who are in charge of all the zoos in Singapore.
They moved the lions with the help of drones with tranquilizers and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that in Pnompenne, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Specialists warned of the threat of rabies from vitamin B9.
Research suggests that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can cause rabies.
The Daily Express reported.
In the opinion of specialists, there are significant evidence that people who do not suffer from a lack of folic acid are less likely to suffer from certain types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, excessive doses of antibiotics actually promote the growth of bacterial cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietologist Bett Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only when it significantly deviates from these figures on the one side or the other.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without the recommendation of a doctor, to observe the dosage and to avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
The earlier consultant on nutrition Raycheal Fain called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Because she is among other things contained in the avocado,, Fain recommended men over 50 to eat this fruit more frequently.
In Great Britain, by April, due to the omicron strain, about 75,000 people could die.
The British researchers' predictions show that, due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in the next five months in England, up to 75,000 people could die, if the existing restrictions were lifted in the winter.
This was reported by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) according to The Guardian.
According to the most optimistic prognosis of the experts who are part of the scientific advisory group of the British Cabinet, by April 2022, the country had recorded more than 25,000 deaths from the strain Omicron and a total of 175,000 hospitalized patients.
At the peak of the epidemic, more than 2,000 infected persons were admitted to the hospitals each day.
"Serious measures to fight against the coronavirus may be necessary to prevent overcrowding in the National Health Service if the Omicron strain is more virulent than the Delta strain and the existing vaccines do not prevent infection. " said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Earlier in the year, the Agency for Health and Safety in the United Kingdom reported that if the rate of spread of the Omicron strain remained at the current level, by the end of the year there would be approximately 1 million cases of infection.
At the same time, in the middle of December, the strain omikron may become the dominant strain in the United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom, 1898 cases of the Omicron strain of the coronavirus have been recorded, of which 633 were recorded in the last 24 hours.
On the other hand, on 9 December, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid stated that the actual figure could be as high as 10,000 cases.
He wanted to write a witty comment,, but did not finish until he reached this point.

Proceedings on super-heavy aircraft increased in the world in the fourth quarter.
Construction of the world's fastest aircraft in 2016 and orders for the following year broke all records, despite calls to reduce the use of fossil fuels and to fight climate change.
In the world's register of ships, the number of ships ordered amounted to 1,200 units, 25 percent more than in the previous year.
In the era of battles against the consequences of climate change, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money to build a permanent residence worth more than 50 million US dollars. writes The Guardian..
However, they become more and more numerous.
In this year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that such a frenzy on the market has not been seen in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford to own a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Previously, all these people worked in offices and met with partners in business, now, the absolute majority of them work remotely and negotiations are conducted by telephone.
Broker William Christie told the newspaper that shipyards would accept orders for new ships in 2025 and later.
This meant that the owners of the yachts were prepared to pay more, only if the yachts were ready for two years or two years earlier.
"The people simply crave freedom, the super- rich can afford to do so., he says.
In western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The wealthy say,, according to sociologists, that they do not want to understand that in times of lack of space travel in space, life on yachts or flights in private aircrafts causes discontent in society because the elite does not want to be separated from responsibility for climate change with the rest of the human population.
Economists urge the government to act and propose new taxes and rules for the super- rich, although they realize that it would be difficult to implement.
In the meantime, the impressive number of superyachts ordered, but also their characteristics..
Of the 1200 ships, 27 have a length of the bow above 100 meters.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a yacht 183 meters long.
After sinking, it would be the largest ship in the world.
On the yacht, a " lunar swimming pool " and also a submarine designed for studying the depths of the sea.
In contrast to the total amount of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide emissions produced by superbombers, the amount of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide emissions produced by superbombers is insignificant.
However, it has symbolic significance, since there are more than 2000 multimillionaires in the world.
This is another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists discovered that the emissions of millionaires were millions of times greater than the emissions of the average inhabitants of the planet.
When one person produces an average of 5 tons of carbon dioxide per year, Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33,9 tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the ship's 162,5 metre long hull were damaged.
Even if the owners of the yachts are not on board, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and order the ship to sail,, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Owners of superyachts do not attract sympathy from other people when they, as the most wealthy woman in Australia, Gina Rainhard, owns ships on the continent and complains through YouTube that their giant ships do not have a dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call for the construction of marines for ships with a length of 50 meters.
Determined to be a dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of rabies in the kidneys.
American scientists determined that the amount of alcohol consumed in a week increases the risk of developing cancer.
According to the Daily Express,.
Specialists came to the conclusion that the consumption of four or more portions of alcoholic drinks per week is associated with increased risk of developing oncology.
However, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
In addition, moderate smokers are at a higher risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases than non-- smokers.
The exact cause of the development of this type of cancer has not been determined, but it has been noted that certain factors lead to harmful processes in the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two--year old child.
Many, more precisely all dog lovers believe that these creations are very intelligent.
However, they are not aware of the extent to which four--legged animals have evolved.
Over the course of many years, biologists conducted various experiments to determine how intelligence develops in animals.
Although the vocabulary of dogs is not as extensive as that of humans, new research has shown that dogs can react to 89 words or phrases.
The work of the scientists was revealed in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs are not allowed to play chess or write poetry, they have no meaning in politics, economics and art, but they often outwit their own masters.
The representatives of some species are considered by experts to have the best understanding of human language,, but the statistical data for precise conclusions is lacking.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered to be fox-like geniuses, for example, the Labrador.
Scientists concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and their ability to learn is comparable to that of a two--year old child.

China is encouraging the development of railway transport.
American, German and French companies were attracted to the Chinese international exhibition of railway and production machinery in 2021, which was held in the city of Chongching in the province of Huainan in Central China.
The main technologies developed by the company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow locomotives to automatically detect and diagnose technical defects, noted the representative of the company Hou Chaoyuan.
High- speed trains operating on the railway line between China and Laos, which was inaugurated in the beginning of the month, are already equipped with these technologies that ensure increased reliability and operability of the locomotive component.
In the last six months, China significantly increased exports of railway transport vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe became witnesses of " Chinese speed.
In May 2014, the production line of the company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. produced the first two--level high speed electric trains designed for export to Europe.
At its maximum working speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains would run on railway tracks in Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the higher- ranked company for Turkey began.
The plane would fly along the line of the metropolitan line connecting the center of Bucharest with the airport of the city.
The opening of this line of the metro will take place in the following year.
This is the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.

China is the country with the highest level of electrification of railways and the highest operational performance on high- speed and urban railways.
The biologist identified the early signs of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences, Semyon Gološeichin in an interview with radio Sputnik described the early symptoms of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia include forgetfulness and a number of other cognitive disabilities, such as the inability to concentrate and plan, as well as a decrease in abstract thinking.
At present, there are discussions about the possibility that loss of hearing may be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, or one of the factors contributing to its emergence, said the specialist.
Gološein emphasized that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative diseases, injuries to the head, certain infections and metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and heart disease are the most common causes of this syndrome.
A biologist noted that, on the present day, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to begin its prophylaxis at an early stage.
According to him, studying foreign languages and actively participating in society reduces the risk of developing dementia.
Also, the WHO recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity and regularly training cognitive skills with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logic thinking.
There are recommendations for the use of various BAADs,, but their effectiveness and purpose are still debated in the scientific community.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity and regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logic muscle.
The earlier benevolent organization for the research of dementia in the United Kingdom announced that the disease often affects people between the ages of 40 and 50.
Medicians named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first symptom of the disease can be considered the problems with vision,, due to which the patient has difficulties in recognizing objects.

Estonian scientists are searching for life on Venus.
The Institute of Technology in collaboration with the Tartarian Observatory and other research institutions and companies is preparing three cosmic missions to Venus for the search of signs of life in the atmosphere, announced on Sunday " Actual Camera ".
The goal of the five- year missions is to assess the habitability of Venetian planets and then search for life there.
For the project of Venetian scientists, they proposed instruments for measuring acidity and the concentration of oxygen in Venetian clouds.
Until recently, it was thought that Venus's clouds were too acidic to support life, but that initially Venus was a planet similar to Earth.
In the course of the third mission, a probe was sent to Venus.
It is assumed that if life is found there, the main question is whether it is similar to or different from earthly life.
If life on Earth is very similar to that on other planets, it is likely that life on Earth did not originate on Earth.
However, it is possible that life may have originated on Earth - said the leader of the Estonian team of the " Venus Life Finder " project, Mikhail Paijasal.
