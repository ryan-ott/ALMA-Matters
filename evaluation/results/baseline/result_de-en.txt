The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods...
I am a #PRS_ORG# large customer, so it is not a problem for me.
All I need is a number or instruction as to what I should put on the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get a refund?
In general, I think it's not fair to ask children to take on a parenting role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it's good for big siblings to take care of the little ones to a certain extent.
Looking in for a few minutes, helping out for a few minutes, bringing the bottle etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is alone for a short time and it's okay for him, that's good.
You can best judge whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not so that he should wind K2 and accompany him for hours while falling asleep.
Legally, it's probably dubious.
Perhaps this is also the reason for the psychologist's statement.
After all, if something were to actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Ob that's a risk you're willing to take is, of course, up to you :)
Help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago and I can remember almost the entire plot, but I can't remember the title. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by drowning himself in food and going into his enclosure with his big cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who gets involved with the therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats patients with fears.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is hired anonymously to go to the place of the suicide and document it and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, forcing the patients to face their fears to the extreme.
(a woman jumps out of a window, another drives herself to death on purpose)
The act of confronting one's fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital where the fire started.
That's the gist of it, I'm pretty sure the book was written by a French author/authoress.
If this action is known to anyone or if someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What should I do next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumb nail
A four-year-old child has wood splinters under the fingernail (outer side) from the entire length.
Attempted to pull him out with a pincer.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance.
Tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to speed up booster vaccination
New cases of the Omikron variant are causing concern among politicians and scientists in the UK.
As a result, all eligible adults in England will be offered a vaccination by New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to speed up the rollout of booster vaccinations against Covid-19 in the face of rapidly rising Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the chance to get a booster dose by the end of the year, provided three months have passed since their second vaccination, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to speed up the vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omikron variant, we are confronted with an emergency, which is why the vaccination must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose.
“Get vaccinated now!”, said Johnson.
Another 1,239 cases of the Omicron variant were recorded in the UK on Sunday, taking the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, it was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price if the item is collected?
I believe that everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns
I sent in an application.
Today, the invitation to a meeting came by e-mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, however, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I looked it up and depending on where they come from, it's either a man or a woman.
**I don't know how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone help me?
**I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on a civil servant's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should think of pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
There are four of them.
Only the one thing I bought today doesn't work
Apparently, the chair had a hidden defect at the time of sale.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
However, this has already been the case for some time.
Not more than 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for them.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims do not seek help or think that we cannot help them.
I know that we can't do everything and that it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I cannot do anything in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to put up with violence.
Often I wish I could help in some way... I know I can't.
But it will never be easy.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
“Arcane” on Netflix: How good is the series for “League of Legends”?

Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick could be relied on.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back on the cup defeat in early October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
However, she did not lie down after the game, but instead increased her efforts in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
While the result itself was disappointing, it was the manner of the performance that was even more so.
Representatively, a statistic is cited that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was a mere 13 percent, 4 shots (all by the young Johannes Patrick) from a total of 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer came from John Patrick: "We weren't concentrated enough after the victory in Tenerife, and we didn't implement what we practiced".
That is, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim, on the other hand, reacted quite differently: "A great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like being in front of 10,000 people.
Only 750 spectators were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they were not disappointed.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game of his team.
“The best playmaker I’ve ever coached”, Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team, the main performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points of closing the gap to 39:59, after they had already trailed by 39 points.
Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Luckily, there is not much time to whine.
On Wednesday (7 p.m.), the giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different e-mail address, but I changed it.
Yes, I registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have consulted a lawyer again and have therefore written to them again.
We had already contacted them six months ago.
Always as if peeled from an egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He can captivate his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on tour with the programme "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform at all.
Originally, Max Raabe was going to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "at the behest of the authorities" to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Other of his planned appearances during the Advent season will also have to be postponed, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists then want to make up for the postponed dates from 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot since he was a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of schlager and chanson in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has taken it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair neatly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer missing from the current German-speaking music scene.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück". dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be combined with existing furniture and so we can check beforehand whether it matches in terms of colour
It still doesn't work, I can only turn the page but not flip it.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Through expropriation, no new apartment is created
The new Federal Minister for Building and Housing, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as it has been demanded in a popular initiative in Berlin.
“With a confiscation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes”, said Geywitz in an interview with the Tagesspiegel (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants peace of mind that their rent will remain affordable for the next few years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is, in fact, the best protection against monopolisation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts to decide how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement envisages a rent cap until 2029, a cap on rental increases in stressed housing markets, and the expansion of the rental index.
I will talk to the Justice Minister to get it implemented as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not calm down, "we will talk with our coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician emphasized.
Hello, I wanted to order something and I noticed after a few days that I had forgotten to complete the last step of the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or whether it will ever come again?

This is absolute cheek
At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes tore through the United States.
Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The pictures from there look like a war zone.
Several tornadoes hit the United States overnight on Saturday, causing widespread destruction and possibly up to 100 deaths.
The storms have left a roughly 320-kilometer-long swath of destruction, particularly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He predicts up to 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising by the hour.
Hallo, ich habe gerade gesehen, dass Vitrine #NAME# ausverkauft ist.
That's very sad.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the catalogue?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
Until when do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the blanket and have it delivered to Germany from the shopping cart?
I sent an article back via the contact form, or a return request, and wanted to check if it had arrived or was being processed, as I have not received a confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccine bonuses and change slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccine bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial incentives for getting vaccinated.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - following the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
He has changed jobs and is now working for a company he used to make fun of.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He has, after all, not stuck to his old job and has been looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, who cares.
After all, he didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron greetings!
I'm currently DMing an adventure for a group of 4 friends, Over the Gryphon's Pass, and I want to seamlessly transition my players into a campaign I've written specifically for them.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been thought up and now I'm writing the introductory adventure and I'm stumbling over my own feet already at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are tasked with transporting a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
That is where the further action will take place.
A few miles from the village, the heroes are ambushed by a group of goblins and lured into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: by convincing, by acting, by threatening, by recognizing the danger early on, whatever comes to the player's mind.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords
The goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a hollow way and flank the wagon on both sides with bows, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If the heroes are defeated in battle, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all unconscious and are then found by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf, and healed.
The cart is, of course, gone.
2. If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and helps the hero in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is fine.
How do you feel about Deus ex Machina's solution 2?
Is the encounter too much of an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will later play an important role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely implement many of your ideas and I now have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Sadly, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back
Can you then send the receipts to come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm fed up with Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality of the German Sky has deteriorated so much that I want to take this opportunity to vent my frustration with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to be able to start the F1 previews on time.
Despite the delayed start and the crash at the start, the schedule was still far behind the planning, but the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!) could still be shown.
Apparently, however, it is so that for legal reasons F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice here.
Still dumb, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to its end.
Despite this, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was another rule infringement by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, who did not know that you can change tyres under a red flag.
Although there were similar situations in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change his tyres only after receiving corresponding radio messages about this from Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
In my opinion, one should just know such basic rules when commenting on Formula 1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first time that there has been speculation about what is now possible or mandatory according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainty in the topic of rules.
In general, Roos' artificial commentary style does not appeal to me, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste.
But seriously, even Heiko Wasser from RTL is better than that.
On top of that, there are constant jokes that make both of them look unprofessional, like ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
In particular, the latter brings a lot of turmoil to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not to mention that advertising has simply taken over at Sky, with Sky being the only broadcaster that goes to commercials in the closing stages, as one can hear on F1 TV, where the German commentary track has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two stations also make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster.
While I have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make up for the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's schedule is also very sparse and full of repeats.
In general, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster to show Formula 1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are allowed to broadcast until the end of the season.
So, at any rate, does the grandiose F1 season make much less fun than it would with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'd be interested to hear your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG#-pendulum light, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hey, I ordered an article that was supposed to be delivered last week, but it hasn't been delivered yet.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing has happened.
The first lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second lady told me she would check her email and send it, and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12, 2019.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I would appreciate your help.
Air pumps are excellent for supplementing an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system with air lifters.
This series is available in 3 variants from us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There, you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run entire systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, you will need a pump with two or more outlets so that you can connect multiple diffusers.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. Fans can also be used to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with a curtain of air (available in our shop) or with a decoration that turns the air bubbles into a function.
A treasure chest, a shell or something similar should be mentioned here.
The MK series has a special, sound-damping construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected via an air hose 4/6 mm to an outlet o.ä. ... and it can start.
The pump should be the same height or higher than the water level, and should be placed outside.
If the pump sits lower than the water level, a backflow preventer should be installed in between.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water flowing backwards, which would cause the water from the pool to run through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture.
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that use little energy
Even though we list the processing time as 3 days on eBay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
As long as everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to take a little precaution so that nobody gets upset just because it took a little longer than usual.
It would be like that, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in logistics... of course, here the coronavirus doesn't stop.
Please do not rate poorly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely the fault of the courier companies.
Ob man natürlich gerne über diese Dienste schimpft, auch wenn wir im Moment sagen,...sie haben es verdammt schwer
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Could I also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends daughter and TV host to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The ten-minute flight took off and landed in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly-minted astronauts back to Earth.
“Welcome back,” Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, said as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in the air for 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 10,700 meters.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled the mission of her father after the short flight.

New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometres
The "New Shepard" rocket flies mostly autonomously.
The capsule detached from the rocket during the flight and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometres above the Earth, at times experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed.
The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to outer space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was the third crewed flight for Blue Origin: The first in July saw Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
During the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was there, as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or is studying biochemistry
I'm currently in my first semester studying biochemistry and I find the subject itself quite interesting and I don't mind being in the lab (I've already done the inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course, I also researched career prospects before starting my studies, but I also thought at the time that I would definitely complete my PhD.
At the moment, however, doubts are creeping in, especially depressing me are the career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear super career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear again and again of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really like to know:
What are you working on at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What have you studied/ what qualifications do you have?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thanks for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and I'm thinking about dropping out of my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as a computer scientist.
If you have any experience with this, please feel free to share it.
Extra stress before holiday and weekend breaks
This topic came up last week with me.
I had to make the most of my long weekend to relax.
That's why it wasn't added until now.
Not only during big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
It seems that there is also one on holidays and bridging days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which we call "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a semi-official half-day off.
So there was a long 4-day weekend last week.
So, what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that had to be sent out before the holiday, orders here, orders there, everything *urgent* before the long weekend.
Because... well, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time has passed and that can't be right?
Or because people really want to achieve so much in a shortened week as they would in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also really annoyed.
What is this self-imprisonment for holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't really enjoy them?!
The stress, however, did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent like that.
My question is: Is it just us, the Swiss, who are like this?
Is that our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know this in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any presents yet.
“The beautiful thing is, even if it doesn’t snow in Erfurt, you can just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest”, said the actress and singer to Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the festive spirit by baking and decorating cookies with her son.
Catterfeld said, "I love it."
Until the festive days, however, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I have to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and the formation of new feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
Most of the feather damage in aviculture is due to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the feathers are made of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein intake of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the moult are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced out.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is cold-water soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thanks, I found it
Sadly, it still doesn't work
DDR handicraft model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Mitteldeutschland, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME Heft 11/1968, used with play marks and defects, the locomotive works well, the E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for pulling heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit comes from the small series manufacturer ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is operational
The German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could pull 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h on this line.
The maximum speed was set at 65 km/h.
Therefore, the DRG decided in March 1926 to deliver the locomotive as 1'Co+Co1' with AEG's mechanical part and Siemens-Schuckertwerke's electric part.
Between December 1927 and June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All of them survived the Second World War and ended up on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were repatriated as war reparations to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, all six locomotives were found to be worthy of restoration.
In 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, using the spare parts from the other locomotives.
At first, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 locomotives, which were available in larger numbers, were preferred.
It was not until it became apparent that the processing capacity of the E 94 could not be increased any further that the E 95 came into focus for processing.
Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were used in a separate timetable mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal heading to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematic was the increasingly complicated control of the locomotives with age.
As a result, it often happened that Schütze got stuck during switching operations.
The brakeman riding on this locomotive had to release the brakes with a hammer and a chisel while the train was in motion.
Damage to the traction motors occurred more often and led to months-long failures of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new-build locomotives were available and there was no significant expansion of the electrified network planned at the time, so that the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most splinter types, so that the E 95 were withdrawn from service.
In addition to this, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives only by one person, which would have been a problem in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid-1969, the E 95 01 was the last to leave service on 5 October 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were dismantled, except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a track heating system at Halle Hauptbahnhof.
It took some time for the authorities at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive underwent external restoration with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has been part of the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is cared for as a museum exhibit.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on making the locomotive operational.
In April 2015, the locomotive was able to be presented for the first time at the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and outer paintwork, where the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines, where they proved their reliability and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were moved to Leipzig to the central German network.
Initially, the main area of operation was Silesia
H0 model in OVP, good function, optical repairs are necessary on the locomotive, dusty, with play marks, smell of cellar, very rare handmade model, very small edition - perhaps the kit was also made by the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part of it.
The middle beam is held by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't assemble the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately defective.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended holder.
I also get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
no, no flat ones.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
As long as they do their job
They are not flat at my place
Could I get these sent to me?
Hey #NAME#, do you need me to explain the problem again?
House fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, damage in the six-digit euro range is estimated to have occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation injuries on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect any deliberate arson.
The Criminal Investigation Department of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But that comes much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To counter fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021
BioNTech CEO Uğur Şahin has not made any public statements about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend had prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
On social media, there were false claims that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Sahin on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
“For a few months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors.”
Until now, he has rejected this, because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe case of COVID-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, wrote Şahin.
He didn't ask why.
“The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often stoked by misinformation and mistrust”.
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
The internet is circulating an interview with Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin says that he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
“At the moment, it is not legal for me to get the vaccine myself,” said Şahin at the time.
There is a priority for the vaccine to be administered in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has had himself vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: Thousands of people without electricity
On Friday evening, the lights went out in several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no electricity and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had knocked out a substation.
Thousands of people in the district of Rhein-Sieg in North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany had to do without electricity for 24 hours after a fire caused severe damage to an electrical substation.
On Friday evening, at 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities, the lights went out.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency generators were in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely repaired in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers from the THW provided assistance in the municipalities.
Authorities offered childcare places in schools and called on neighbours to help.
The supplier thanked the affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their untiring efforts," said the head of the department of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a press release on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to put some of the lines back into operation on a provisional basis, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
According to Westnetz, the fire, which broke out at around 7:15 p.m. on Friday, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching station in Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
There are extensive cleaning and repair works needed there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply has been restored.
As of Saturday 18:00, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 21.30.
Since 23:15 p.m., the last of those affected by the outage also had electricity.
More than 80 engineers from Westnetz and partner companies were on the job.
Authorities had called for neighborly help after setting up emergency power supplies for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
“What is important now is that citizens take care of older or lonely people in their neighborhoods and let the local fire stations know if help is needed”, Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) explained after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who were not able to take care of themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical devices or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is out of stock in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the underside on the tabletop.
It is a custom #NAME#.
There are three variations of this.
We wanted those with tabletops with a diameter of #NUMBER#
We got a 155cm diameter.
Today, my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't fold it in half, so I can't shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for that purpose.
I would appreciate any feedback
Yes, it really is easier!
Then we'll do it that way!
Can you send me the return shipping label by e-mail?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before buying, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find it almost disrespectful to offer such a low payout.
We are not in agreement with this
Nordic Combined: Combined Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have won the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Again, the duo had to give way to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country race with a big lead after the ski jump.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be returned to my account?
Yes, we both made new ones and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they've heard of the problem before.
I bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on there.
When I try to open it, I get the message: ups!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty, please report it to the customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now what?
I have to work in between!
To ensure that the color is applied evenly and cleanly, you should clean the parts with a little soap and water of dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you paint the brush for the first time with a new color on the model, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the parts that will not be visible later, or on a yogurt container.
The first mark on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
The slight overlap of the color layers later results in a uniform surface.
Avoid wiping back and forth with the brush too quickly.
This results in unrealistically shaped areas.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could otherwise later shine through.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come at the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metallic streaks can occur when they are mixed with normal colours.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you glue them together.
The models achieve the original appearance through the decals/stickers.
From aircraft insignia to ship names to trim and badges on car models: Decals give the models the finishing touch.
Place the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit is easier to cover before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool, such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks, are time, patience and a steady hand when sticking.
Cut each required decal individually and lay them out as needed.
Decals are also known as water slide decals because you moisten their backs with water until the backing paper turns dark.
Then you just move the picture a little bit from the paper and place it on the corresponding place on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper to the side.
Attention: Always check first if the picture is in the right place before you move it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, crumple or even tear.
Use a household towel to absorb excess water.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time when I look for something else, then I can't read the book anymore and I have to log out and log in and load the book again and find the place where I stopped reading.
On Saturday, I had already communicated with you.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 separate packages to me.
Ok, thanks anyway!
Then I'll buy elsewhere once the money is back.
Will I be able to get it back easily?
Treatment of infertility in private health insurance / What is a "case of insurance"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for a while, and now, when it comes to reimbursement from the health insurance company, this one is suddenly putting up a fuss.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the PKV and received the go-ahead for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the PKV.
A few months later, we tried for a second child, and had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we hadn't yet factored the PKV into the equation.
We applied again for the costs to be covered by the private health insurance company and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, of course the most expensive ones will be reimbursed by the PKV), we sent the bills to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The rationale: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first acceptance are forfeited.
The second pregnancy is a new insurance case.
However, according to the terms and conditions, "the insurance event begins with the treatment, and ends when treatment is no longer necessary."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
*Who is right here, the PKV (only three attempts are reimbursed) or us (five attempts are reimbursed)?
*Did the PKV have to warn us that the further attempts would be forfeited with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thanks a lot for your help already!
Could you please send me the three variants by e-mail and tell me how I can get back to them again?
Okay.
We will no longer order anything from them.
If they add up my and my friend #NAME# (same address) sales, they must have lost a good customer.
Feel free to pass that on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't do anything about the fact that the wardrobe is completely disturbed when it arrives here.
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote.
There is clearly stated that the repayment was initiated and I still have not received a repayment from #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you've lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment through his account.
We are not going to do that any more.
No, the defect did not appear until several months later.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell them as office chairs.
Independent of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, I am not able to obtain another type of packaging.
I will disassemble the wardrobe and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional chairs that we unfortunately cannot find at your location.
Can you help?
Weekly theme: The best low-budget films
What a low-budget film is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The following is what Wikipedia has to say about this:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to find out the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you
Best regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, it is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing has changed in the waiting position... I will soon give up, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
Half-victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarussian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher of the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) explained.
This state of suspension - Belarus is not quite a loser, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
The handling of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong.
There appears to be a "growing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not taken a stand against this, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakened the cohesion in the Union.
“She can’t get her way when a member state decides to do its own thing”, as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy will be more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
Meanwhile, according to information from Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were detained and returned to the border overnight on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or attempted to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler of Minsk, of luring them in with the prospect of visa-free travel to the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's response has been the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
“The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hardball tactics and extraterritorial sanctions”.
Minsk must also take into account the internal political costs.
The Belarussian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly passes thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The protest relates to an alleged infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the final safety car phase, when he allegedly overtook illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the classification at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed correctly.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre occurred shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch driver had overtaken him.
I'll see what I can do.
I'll speak to the bank and I'll get back to you
Thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park organizes SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, the namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg to the Europa-Park Fantag.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coasters were lit up in red and white on this day.
Foxes, Ed the European Hedgehog and lots of red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop, the park said.
The collaboration between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park has once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Shining fans to be seen having fun together on the roller coaster confirms it," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not like originally 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives by the sea in a house and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I submitted a contact form yesterday to return an item, but have not received an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been accepted.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and low-quality goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all from our house.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite, that doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an AfDler says he has nothing against foreigners.
They won't admit it, but they're both i's.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some antisemitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it alone.
Yeah wow, then you're as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who fundamentally questions the theory of evolution is simply completely lost.
For the sake of it, a god has set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just a bunch of nonsense.
And that makes you a science denier and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially plan-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the loupe practically free of distortion and colour aberration up to the edge zone.
Lenses are often marked with magnification values.
However, these figures only apply under exactly defined conditions, which seldom correspond to the conditions of use.
To get the most out of your magnifying glass, we ask you to take note of the information in the table "Technical data" (see the instructions in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the surfaces of all optical devices, including impact binoculars.
By using an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
As long as the optimal use conditions are met - the lens is held close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz, women search for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some strange situations when selling Christmas trees.
Once a man even drove home without his partner, because they couldn't agree on anything.
Every year he plants about 2000 of them.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many strange situations.
That makes the pre-Christmas period a bit funny, he says.
And the voucher?
Otherwise, I'm out as a customer!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have a discussion about which is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have therefore their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like a "spinner", which is nowhere near as tasty sounding.
Problems with fibre optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable WiFi network.
Before I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly with 50 Mbit reception and transmission, except for a few failures.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives these.
However, at the other DLan module that sends the WiFi signal, the full 500 does not come through, but the more I move away from the module with the socket, the less comes through (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than DLan, but there were also large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed goes down the drain with fibre optic cables?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in that house.
I'm really getting desperate, which is why I've created an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a response.
When it's time to switch your current account
Those who thought that now there would be peace with the current accounts, will be disappointed.
While many banks have used the autumn to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the free amounts for negative interest rates are also falling further.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the allowance and quadrupled it for the savings account.
In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank subsidiary - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
However, these lower thresholds now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the limit at ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the exemption thresholds in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks now have a threshold of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which, in the first instance, won the case against this regulation before the Landgericht Berlin.
Discussions are already taking place in the banks about whether the institutions should perhaps set aside reserves - in the event that the top courts declare negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions of bank customers have to have their money refunded.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the head of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a rollercoaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of their appearance.
After all, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, that's right: just ONE chip from the bag).
That they still manage to win the hearts of female and male fans alike is nothing short of a miracle.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with love - and is still looking for the big love.
And the desire to have a baby has been crossed off the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she was going to become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that question have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, as to why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It is hoped that success and fame will also make people happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen gives up
Kimi Räikkönen's retirement from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight touch of the curb, Kimi Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after less than half of the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix that the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children also went to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Kimi Räikkönen's greatest achievement was winning the World Championship in 2007 with Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole and came 103 times onto the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup win - Nolte wins two-man bob - Sports
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
“I did the calculations, I would have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026”, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who won two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he defended the attack from Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second, going from third place to first.
He then adjusted the material setting and on Sunday he won with 0.3 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he beat the Brit Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
“We took a bigger risk today and it paid off,” said Friedrich, who also notched his 22nd straight victory.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth this time, after finishing second in the previous race.
Christoph Hafer from the BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it too,” said Lochner.
Nolte with home win - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won her third season victory on her home track in the women's two-woman bob.
After finishing fourth in the monobob on the previous day, she raced to victory with pusher Deborah Levi in the German triple triumph on Sunday.
Two-woman bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to qualifying for the Olympics, she won her first podium this winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki and Leonie Fiebig finished third.
For me, it was super cool to be on the podium for the first time in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I'm super happy with the development.
There's still a lot of potential out there, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just pushing, but there's a lot to do around it as well."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not entirely error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and I could buy it now!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it, so I couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it.
Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired, which made me very angry.
Check out the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again, since it's on sale right now :)
Why will the shipping only start on 16.3.?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No, unless I type on it, there is an extra field with the message
It was taken yesterday by your colleague.
Why is it a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrect delivery.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new, undamaged one.
And not to cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear wonderful girls and women,
I have a lot of things that I just want to write down and maybe it will resonate with someone else as well.
I'm 24, I have PTSD, I'm a full-time student and dog mama - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's basically my child.
My boyfriend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, he got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
I visited him yesterday because I also have emotional needs and I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand was in a bandage due to a burn).
He is also cold and we see each other less (1-2 times a week) which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I warmed him up with the heat lamp and stroked him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's away for a month.
Now we also have to do some housework, which we will of course share.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is in a good place right now, I'm fairly well-treated and I'm getting by.
Not good, but I get by and am almost symptom-free.
My university is asking a lot of me right now (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and on Wednesday I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a bit.
And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space left in there.
So goes my week: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then it goes on, doesn't it?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I won't be able to do it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm endlessly grateful that I don't have to work.
I'm really unbelievably grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived otherwise.
I think it also has something to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different colour plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has a mark.
In the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or something?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Incidentally, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I found out at school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject like maths or geography for them.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was brought up as a Christian and I always somehow believed it.
How do you feel about that?
Maybe you can also talk about colleagues and/or students with different attitudes.
In general, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate them.
There's also a curriculum and so on.
But I also find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Cultural heritage or something like that?
I hope your question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not?Write in English, I understand it well
That's a long time ago, so I'd avoid it
Thanks, that's good.
I expect to receive a response in the near future, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help, please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for teenagers.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, the modern world (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action ensues.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Land of the Dead who wants to take the woman to the Land of the Dead so that he can live himself, I think.
I think the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, I think both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this means anything to you, I am grateful for any response.
Our little one has slept on her tummy from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive!
Relax.
A child can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything else is right, no cuddly toys, go in more often to check, but no minute surveillance.
That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child while it sleeps.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it lift itself up from the belly?
Or is it lying face down directly on the mattress?
This will tell you if everything is okay.
We also all grew up, and when my husband was born, it was common practice to lay the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already purchased many articles.
But why are you offering me only 20 EUR?
Hello, I have already written to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not yet received a response.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right-hand drawer doesn't fit in the cupboard.
I kindly ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held up.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's simply the case that the politics of this station are now beneath contempt.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a begging tour at the same time.
It was said to be an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Arno quote: "We don't want to be a moving billboard."
What am I now?
A 0815 advertising station that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's and Don'ts.
Which apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and who, at the expense of the action, tries to make a mess of things with the exploded rented premises.
How is all of this supposed to be good?
It's great if you like it, I find it horrible.
I request a call back as my delivered wooden table was defective.
Damage to the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# body.
Whether as a consoler for stomach aches or just for cuddling - my little warm friend is versatile.
Cherry hull pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing warmth applications, as cherry hulls absorb and release heat very well.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe even when they are not feeling well.
The buckwheat cushion with cover is only suitable for the following applications as a heating pad:
Before heating the cushion, check it for untypical smell, stains or burn marks and dispose of it immediately if any are present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before warming it up!
Heat in a microwave oven at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave oven manufacturer!).
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then lay the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first heating, there may be a slight moisture formation at the surface, which disappears after repeated applications.
Always follow the heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy consumption can cause damage (fire and burn hazard!).
Before heating a pillow in the microwave, check that the manufacturer's instructions allow for the heating of grain products.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion to see if it is suitable for babies (max. 43 °C)!
Do not use the cushion for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh haematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as for persons with reduced pain sensitivity.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are escaping, dispose of the product and loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the baby should be checked regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious adverse events related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is located.
The cover is removable and can be washed at 30 °C in the washing machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt in the first half of the season second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 is dreaming of a return to the Bundesliga.
In the meantime, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt either under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this one about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that the power supply alone would be enough to operate it.
No show, the battery is dead and the laptop won't start even with the power supply plugged in.
After that, I removed the battery, but nothing happened.
Maybe you have some ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop when it's connected to the network?
Is there anything else broken?
Thanks for your help!
I would like the delivery of #PRS_ORG# to my room.
How do I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour, but still with a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
The 20-litre capacity swallows even larger photographic equipment with ease, which can be safely stowed away using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And everything else you need for everyday use is kept well-organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The stylish, minimalist design packs a punch - Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions with the Everyday Backpack series that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to photo gear in seconds.
This works in two ways: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellent solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are four anchor bars, securely riveted, into which the closure hook can be inserted.
If the rucksack is fully loaded, just take the top beam, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flaps and hooks are also magnetic.
In this way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without jamming the hook.
The second option fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with top access - you don't have to wade through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enorm: If you are not only taking your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can customize the interior to your liking (more on that below) and so both of them can be easily separated from each other and accessed independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side to access the camera gear in the right main compartment while keeping everyday items safely on the left side of the backpack and out of the way.
Comfortable, easy-to-adjust straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry, even if it's heading to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I have been waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an e-mail yesterday to confirm the commissioning of
Announcement of contact from the shipping company to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I haven't received any messages.
I would like this to be dealt with immediately.
I am now writing to the third support employee, none of them got me further than the promise that I would receive an e-mail as confirmation.
This is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
Is it foreseeable when the wardrobe will be delivered again?
It's not an option for me to keep him like that...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
I hope you have a lovely evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order and payment was made on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that last year turned out differently than expected, I couldn't have guessed that, and I didn't have time to claim and clarify it.
But the damage as a customer, I don't accept that.
Rotor brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver who values reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotating brake discs are cast and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created that focuses on the centering of the glass after the characteristics of the original mounting.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the window, while the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windshields emphasize the character of each car through an attractive and eye-catching appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and led to the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far to make Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Districts were marked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted a piece of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer looking for riches in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You'll be looking for gold, recruiting workers, rounding up horses, and building companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river valleys and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can fine-tune your individual play style with adjustments.
Coloma plays over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) and 1850 (the year California became a state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will be blocked!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions have been completed, the pioneers return.
The pricer turns at the beginning of each round to a new location, changing the available actions.
This continues until the raiser has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from a bandit attack.
If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up on the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is awarded.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping method, parcel (games rolled up).
For everything else usually DPD insured and with tracking (games rolled up, wrapped in bubble wrap and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send the box in a box for an additional charge of 2 euros, so that there are no creases at all.
“Why children are not tyrants” Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental abuse, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary popped up in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrannical" (2008), he triggered a heated debate on child-rearing.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is difficult to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Never, never, never should it be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, it still gives me the shivers.
Holetschek: Countries to discuss removal of testing requirement for triple vaccinated
The health ministers of the federal states want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the testing obligation for triple vaccinated people.
“We need clarity quickly on whether and when the testing obligation can be lifted for three times vaccinated people”, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Ministers of Health, to Bild am Sonntag.
The removal of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will present a proposal to the Conference of Ministers of Health on Tuesday of next week". − AFP
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I go about that?
Hallo, ich finde den #PRS_ORG#-Stuhl sehr schön, allerdings kann ich nicht sehen, wie hoch die Sitzfläche ist.
Can you help me?
I can no longer process a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred.
Buying over the #PRS_ORG# website on a computer is possible.
I have updated my bank details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, which means sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
The most common is hearing sounds/voices, followed by seeing images, and the least common is feeling pain.
For this topic relevant: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as they avoid a very deep anaesthetic to protect the baby until after the placenta has been delivered.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anaesthetic assessment.
Certain anaesthetic techniques, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), carry a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT:Liebe alle, dieser Kommentar von mir beschreibt zwar Awareness korrekt, allerdings hatte u/Nitemarex per definition keine.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros won't help us.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please check if you can at least return the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I have already sent you an e-mail, which you have not answered.
One more question.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipping company is #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I'll have to cancel the order, as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
won't I be called?
I had a question formulated
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has established himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Gets Older".
The shattering diary of a slow goodbye to the world, written by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby declare my gratitude for life."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is the European pallet, a standardised wooden pallet used mainly in the European region as a means of transport.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pieces of palettes were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria each year is not recorded
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in regulation time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in the penalty shootout with 4-2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had beaten Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got some great tips last week on how to make the perfect goulash.
It was served at Christmas and it was absolutely delicious and melt-in-the-mouth!
Thanks again for that!
Now I've got a taste for it and I want to cook rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time.
Tomorrow I will be setting a beef stock.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books, and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I will manage
IEs demands a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed by e-mail on 18 January that the refund had been made.
However, I still haven't received the money.
Please check that.
Where you can still get Christmas roast in Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you bought any poultry yet?
Time is running out.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set both the desired level and the saturation of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and distortion.
Above, it was already hinted that with the POWER LEVEL regulator, you can even create a power reserve, if it ever gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a simulation of the box, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
An the AUX socket, a CD or MP3 player can be connected, so that you can jam to your favourite songs.
A tuner is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 footswitch, you can call up the sounds easily by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and adjust the tempo of the effect blocks that are compatible in this way.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen that with others.
Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If that's not possible, I'd be happy with a legacy or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I may be able to find a buyer for the furniture.
More than 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait has not been worth it

Iran sees progress in talks on nuclear deal
According to Iranian reports, there are signs of progress in the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
“Both sides are close to reaching an agreement on the issues on the agenda,” Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri said on Sunday to the news agency IRNA.
This is a "positive and important development", as at first there was no agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks aimed at reviving the agreement had been resumed after a break of almost a week.
The talks are attended by negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is not directly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Federal state now has highest Corona infection rate
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only state, the value exceeds the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia exceeded the mark of 1000 on the Corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day incidence with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always recorded the highest infection rate nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths in connection with an infection were reported within 24 hours.
200 severely ill with COVID-19 were being treated in intensive care units on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be reporting delays.
In addition, the health authorities have been overburdened for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the registration of new cases.
I see what you mean.
Since the delivery is only scheduled for early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, right?
Do I have to do anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return at my own expense, please.
The 8 euro return shipping fee is, in my opinion, an outrage.
It's time for change
##Members of the Bundestag, I greet you, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why the post here?
If you take a look at the activity in the past few months of the MBundestag, you can come to one conclusion: it does not exist.
We're in a winter slump and we've extended the summer doldrums to several months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, it's just a matter of being dissatisfied with how things have gone here and how we generally stand.
In recent days, the impression has been growing that many people here still have a real interest in the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
Here, the community around the MBundestag is called upon to keep this alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of the project in recent days and found, simply put, a mess.
After some back-and-forth, several people from the community expressed interest in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to expressly invite everyone to participate, only so this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Goals:
*How should the Bundestag work in the future?
*What existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
*How do we want to present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
*How should new members be recruited?
*How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a lot of things, but that's not a big deal, we have the Discord at the end.
If you're interested and have the time, come on the Discord, work with us and let's democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you, which is still to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for my taste.
I already ordered another hanging system from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took off the soft foam.
I'm very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: does the blanket #PRS_ORG# come in a large size, i.e. 240/240 cm?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cupboard will be collected as soon as possible.
And I ask you to do that now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, I will dismantle the shelf as far as possible for pickup - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by telephone to arrange a collection date.
Is there an installation manual?
How long would I have to get these or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today, I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like.
She herself lived vegetarian for a while, eats meat very rarely nowadays.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years before that.
When asked if I've always wanted to be vegan, and that vegetarianism was a planned stepping stone, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that I was supporting animal welfare as a vegetarian, but that I eventually reflected and understood that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
In that moment, I got the impression that there was some resentment on their side, they defended vegetarianism and said they knew where their meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise, without you having to do anything about it.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be present at the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I can't be there in person, I'm afraid that's not something that can be changed.
Could you please assign me an alternative pick-up date?
As of 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available again on a full-time basis.
Lahnsteiner Wehr ready for water rescue: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, handed over a subsidy certificate in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire department of Lahnstein to the mayor, Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this regard," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The rescue vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Under and above water, they carry out tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one expects a permanent increase in the number of operations: the boom in the hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle and the further increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure waterway contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I have followed their recommendations but nothing has worked. I have synced, removed and reloaded the app but nothing has worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because this whole thing has taken up a lot of my time and I'm hoping for help.
Okay, then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for standing up to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, i.e. we were also armed officers in the executive, I do not want to go into further details!
I think the question of right and left is always oversimplified.
In general, it should be said that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be obvious to everyone.
That, of course, also applies to people wearing uniforms and carrying weapons. It should be clear to everyone that these people then have a hard time dealing with the lived reality. It should also be clear to everyone that, in addition to the average white person, you now have many Germans with a migrant background, women, and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the over-the-top stereotypical gay men, but rather normal men and women who don't talk about it if you don't ask them), and you can rely on these people, because in the event of an emergency, they will save your life or risk their own.
But even these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel neglected by overblown left-wing policies, even though these policies are supposed to benefit them, but they just want to be treated normally.
Going back to the rights, of course, the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, so you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there, or even openly forge some kind of state-threatening plans is massively exaggerated in the media, and it also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers, who often work abroad, start to generalize and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect because of negative experiences.
It also happens that right-wing-minded friends meet, who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such things are well combated and countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled, and that's a good thing, in my opinion, because we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
However, this was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could send the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany or is this basket available in Germany somewhere?
I only find you as a partner company.
but there are two deep grooves at the top edge of the wooden part, which were filled with something yellow.
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordentlicher durch Kind?
Hello, I (w32) have been thinking about this for a while.
I am very disciplined and organised at work (self-employed, little leisure time), but I have always struggled to keep my home clean and tidy.
There are always phases where nothing gets done, and then and wann it hits me and I clean and tidy up.
But it's never really "that someone could spontaneously drop by."
My husband is (unfortunately) also not better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly he just loses against work and laziness.
The kitchen is still cleaned the most often, because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organised with a child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because for me there is no incentive, it doesn't bother me at all, as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child give you a greater incentive or do you remain careless?
I look forward to hearing from you.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically shaped cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I have been trained in software development and have been out of work for about a year.
Unfortunately, I realize more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
This basically means that I have low self-esteem and as a result, I am shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on a professional level, but it's hard for me to have casual conversations and I've been told that I come across as unapproachable (which I think has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in, for example, the addiction counselling or family counselling.
But I don't know if the actual working day is really like I imagine it to be, and it's hard to find anything about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it drags me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("again, the simplest things messed up") and it's hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should know this by now"/"I'm holding him back with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm underpaid" etc.).
I'm probably going to have these problems in every job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I'm waiting for a pick-up appointment
What do they mean by "please return"!
If I download a book from #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# authorised this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG# and he asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken in with the food (protein) is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and these are then used by the bird to build up its own protein substances, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather renewal in the maturing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high burden for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during the breeding season, as this can lead to disruptions in the breeding cycle.
Following this short course of NEKTON-Bio, NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is advisable to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe feather damage, the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be doubled or tripled at the beginning, until the new feather growth is visible.
Then the normal dose is given until the feather regrowth is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, out of direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and included photos.
Have you received this email?
Statement by a church employee in contradiction to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
A request for felling was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnuts, is not part of the statutes.
However, in the statutes, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the other hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for that.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me an inheritance or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe so, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Emergency: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the police's press alarm (14:03), a car came into the opposite lane while overtaking.
There are injuries.
Okay, I understand.
Okay, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for a further career
Happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is not very good, because my dear head is currently destroying everything that can be destroyed.
Before I go off on a tangent here ... in short: I need advice and, ideally, from people who know something about my situation - i.e. from you.
I'm currently doing the Ref course as a lateral entrant.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a certain area (in order to remain somewhat anonymous, I will not mention anything more specific here).
In the end, though, it was just too boring for me and I started looking for alternatives that would be more fun.
At some point, I ended up in teaching, and I was sure that's what I wanted to do - even if the working conditions are a lot less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't bother me.
I'm now at the third "I Google other job postings" stage.
And it's only been six months.
Before the paintings, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still change my mind.
But right now, I'm absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's the holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I thought I was stress resistant, but my weekend was my weekend and my weekend was my weekend.
There, I was free.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that drive me crazy.
Basically, it's fun, and from the outside looking in, the Ref seems to be doing a good job.
But I'm completely exhausted and wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I wonder if I want to spend the rest of my working life like this - especially when I see some of your contributions here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, where I could take time off when I needed it, and where the work was boring but paid fairly, and where I worked as part of a team and not as a lone ranger like most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I'm not going to be in the same place a year from now, and I'm going to be unhappy.
You can tell it's all a bit weird, but perhaps you have some advice or ideas as an outsider on how I can get out of this situation, where I'm completely fed up and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make any decisions right now, emotionally, that's probably not going to lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for the time being.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny tone.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continued to evolve, leading to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these are better at reproducing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just bubble over.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, until the amp and the effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology, which was introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube-like character of the amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The 12AX7-tube-equipped Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reproduces the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro closure elements, it adapts to the needs of your photography equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format DSLRs.
In the end, what fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an on-camera flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or the Fujifilm X-T2 still have room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can also store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also a good choice for drone pilots, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, which lasted for 84 days, was considered to be the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has subsided somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists are still unwilling to predict when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state television channel RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000 degrees Celsius hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
That's almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new land masses of about 50 hectares in size emerged off the coast as cooled lava.
Most affected was the island's immensely important banana cultivation, from which about half of the island's approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper El País.
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still unites our increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "peace-making contract between primitive peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked Christmas with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day.
The background to this still-popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gifts gave rise to the popular German custom of filling children's boots with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they reject mediators between God and man as "saint worship".
For this reason, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas into the Christ Child, thereby establishing a new line of tradition.
Therefore, the focus of the giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants don't see these details as so important, it only annoys a few that the tradition of St. Nicholas is still as much a part of the pre-Christmas season as the tradition of St. Martin with the singing of the St. Martin's song and the St. Martin's procession.
Today, one can find everything from socks to luxury watches in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a festive muddle over the question of who will bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region, whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is basically a kind of Santa Claus, who has acquired some characteristics over time.
This includes, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure of Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes, mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought a lot of fame.
Here, it's not reindeer, but three horses pulling his sleigh.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for delivering the gifts.
I've been getting this error message for 3 weeks now when I try to download a new book, my account details and contact details are up to date:
Please help with troubleshooting, as I
otherwise buy another e-Book #PRS_ORG#.
I have been trying to get a return shipping label for my order #NUMBER# for the past week and this morning.
I was told that one would be sent to me.
Since I have not received one yet (in the SPAM folder as well), I would now like to ask how long this usually takes.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
A man armed with a knife has been shot dead by police near the Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
The police said callers had reported a man with a gun going into a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officers a short time later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
Several embassies are based in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?
No matter where I click, I am immediately redirected to your page.
The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The light is simply placed and can be anchored with 2 earth pegs in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar panel for optimum charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum of 10 hours of light.
The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow brightly inside.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: All it takes is the sun to make this solar lamp shine in a fascinating way - in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The edge-less, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a large natural pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of a terrace, in the lawn or in a rockery.
He makes a good impression also in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he manages to hold his own thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not need a connection or batteries.
Place the "lightstone" on a sunny spot at any place you like.
Two supplied stakes provide secure footing when needed.
The matt white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar panel hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, along with his battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight hits the housing.
As dusk falls, "Smart Stone" begins to glow on its own; in which color, that's up to you: Six attractive light colors are available - in addition to daylight white - for you to choose from.
The shutdown also happens automatically when the battery's charge level falls to a predetermined minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun comes out, the charging cycle begins again the next day.
I've done this many times and it doesn't work.
I'm sorry, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, I will not order from you out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
In the lockdown, of course, no hardware store is open ...
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has again been fundamentally improved.
A variable PWM frequency of 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super-quiet operation even in gear motor applications - the typical "hum" is a thing of the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows automatic measurement of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers up to 1.5A of motor current, even for older motors.

Pill problem
Hello lovely ladies,
I hope I'm doing this right, after a year on reddit this is actually my first post.
My problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such horrible cramps during my period and shitty PMS before my period.
Now I'd like to leave that alone, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses, which I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had a sudden explosion of pimples when I took a two-year break from 0 to 100, and they were everywhere.
So superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of hiatus, nothing has ever really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without bullshit, but maybe someone can recommend something to me.
Unfortunately, my gynecologist did not take me seriously and I still have to make an appointment with a dermatologist.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the skin is such a thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis as a child, then a period of calm, then large pustular psoriasis and the acne issue.
Nutrition I have also tried everything possible in the context of Christian illness, and I have stuck with a sugar, dairy and meat-free mixed diet, because nothing else has worked properly.
It can also be the case that hormonally there is something wrong, but if you want to find out what else is going wrong, you don't want to go looking for it.
I already had everything from her colleague semina o. ä.
Written and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was said in response to my request.
I have to work in between and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but is there one in general?
as it is available in black large.

In the name of the people: lay people pass judgement
They sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench in the courtroom.
But their verdict has a lot to do with it, even if they don't wear a robe: lay judges decide with professional judges whether and for how long someone goes to jail.
Two of them talk to the "Oeffentlichen" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the John-F.-Kennedy-Straße Landgericht.
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into my customer account.
Could you please resend the invoice for the order number #NUMBER# to the above e-mail address?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We don't have the means to store them for so long.
We would use the table as they offered it, as if it were ours.
of course, I already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. I would therefore like to have one in grey
Does the wardrobe have to be completely disassembled for pick-up and return?
and when would the pick-up be?
110-kV-earth cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision paves the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning.
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only been partially delivered to us.
The blue Betsell number #PRS_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what happens next?
Have a great start to the week!
Forget that, I've already explained it to you several times yesterday!
This is a dresser made of glass, and all the sides are cracked, so there is glass everywhere, and the box is broken.
The chest of drawers stands in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's with all books, that's why the request to #PRS_ORG#, because it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning a lesson (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been in the ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I'm currently having a hard time planning my lessons in geography in an efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not very well equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the school book and an OHP as media.
In school, I can also only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I need a lot of time right now to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors, and in my case, each hour stands on its own.
Basically, the methods are always the same, but on the other hand, I don't want to spend too much time on simple lessons (I also need it for UBs, etc.).
I usually plan from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I'd really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already chosen a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as soon as possible.
The trade is concerned about the Christmas business due to the 2G rule.
Only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed to enter most shops.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of losses in turnover.
He also has a possible solution.
According to the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G regulations are destroying the important Christmas business for the retail trade.
Sales of non-daily-needs goods have suffered a drop in turnover, according to HDE chief executive Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey of the HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
“What was supposed to be the high point of the year is now often a hole with no bottom,” said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the past week.
It is only in the food retail sector and online that things are going well.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
“2G at shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic”, he stressed.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a high level of staffing.
He demanded that the elastic band rule be allowed nationwide.
Thereafter, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the wristband received that day.
Furthermore, in the retail sector - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - spot checks should be sufficient.
Even the shopping centre specialist real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at about 75 percent of the pre-corona level without 2G, and the turnover at about 90 percent.
These figures are now falling in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Because of the high personnel and administrative costs, attempts are being made to find solutions and obtain approval for the centers.
This also includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, once present their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel, can freely enter all stores". dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG# and received it.
The Spiegel has a scratch and the frame also has a blemish, which was attempted to be covered up with yellow filler.
That doesn't look good.
I would like to return the mirror and I have already put it back in the package and sealed it.
How do I have to proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor is responsible for setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually.
Take advantage of the current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very high luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree beam angle that allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance is excellent.
Also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also also
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to use both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is installed in inaccessible locations.
The control panel is on the back of the light, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in kelvins.
There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings for each of the memory slots, simply hold down the memory buttons for a longer period of time.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when the lamp is turned on again, the known situation is restored - Very practical in studio work, for example, if the camera is set to a specific color temperature.
Working with batteries is one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is derived from the ability to operate with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check if the batteries have enough power before the set - it has a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments there is a value in the two display displays (upper display for the left battery compartment, lower display for the right battery compartment).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the spotlight is very simple.
It has a 16mm thread for attachment, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination is to be reliably set by adjusters on both sides.
Attention was paid to the fact that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and, as a result, are designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a tilt mechanism is included in the delivery.
Great that it also comes with a bag.
This way you can transport or store the light with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
“Party we wanted to throw”: Frankfurt celebrates after comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the previously twice in a row defeated Hessians were apparently on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned it around, shot their frustration over a lacklustre start to the season out of their system in a furious 5-2 win within an hour. "It's crazy what the guys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner said at DAZN, and spoke a "general compliment to everyone who was involved."
At first, it looked like another setback for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt, who are still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What then happened impressed even the SGE coach.
“How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance”, Glasner continued.
I am very happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth game and his overcame muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
“I think our mentality is incredible,” said the 27-year-old, who was delighted with the result in particular for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep his focus on himself and sees himself as well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It's extraordinary that we have all our players fit in December, that all our players are physically in top shape.
It's top-class work in our medical department, but also the players live a very professional lifestyle.
Now one wanted to "go step by step and be modest" and complete the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is a trip to Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (18.30 p.m., Sky).
I just got the mail that my package is coming back to me because of a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money has been reimbursed and I can place the order again?
Would mean for me that I would not order again, because it has already taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Shock for German women's handball team ahead of quarter-final against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and blank stares.
In the final round of the World Cup, the DHB team suffered a heavy defeat against Spain with 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers. In the quarter-finals, the team will now have to play against the host country.
“We were too timid and had too much respect for the opponent,” said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind Denmark (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
It was a bad game from all of us that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday, a significant improvement is needed to keep the tenuous dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
“We were just not there – neither in attack, nor in defence”, Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: “We have to look ahead now”.
Not up to scratch from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament matches, the German team was not at its best at the start of the match.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for the quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the job and prevented things from getting worse with a few saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels finished a quick counterattack successfully.
This, however, was not the hoped-for spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly set themselves in scene - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was over after 20 minutes with a score of 3-10, as the backcourt player Mia Zschocke saw a red card for a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she will be allowed to participate again in the quarter-finals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB team get better into the game, and by the end of the first half they were at least five goals behind.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes with a score of 9:19.
Again, the Groener-trainees sinned in all areas and made it easy for the opponent, who is one of the medal contenders at the finals, to win.
As a result, the German team was unable to muster a performance increase and left the court as the clear loser.
DACH Advent calendar Day 6: Family traditions during the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we've won the day of Nikolaustag and are taking this as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas period, Advent, Nikolaustag, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.
How was it at home with you then?
How is it with your\*r partner\*in?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the most beautiful thing for the children?
Cleaning the boots?
Do you like to bake cookies?
Christmas tree decorating?
Will there be music?
Will Santa Claus, the Christkind, or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone tries to make it as nice as possible as a family around Christmas.
Whether it's a fixed tradition, or even something different every year: tell us how it goes in your family!
Please send me any transaction number... or anything else that might help.
Confirmation of transfer... etc
I would like to give a voucher as a gift
just like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
do they do that?
The title is there, I work as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these are almost finished, I will then go to vaccination centres for me.
I will gladly answer questions about the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. "I am taking medication X, is that compatible with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility, the vaccination information, the indication (the person has the right to be vaccinated according to the COVID-19 vaccination regulation and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have a doctor with us, but only pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of the vaccine, who are not allowed to administer vaccinations (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!), so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused heated debate in the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern".
However, unlike many previous days, the term was not guessed by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "nervous person".
And no one "who has to get everything done quickly."
That, the people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also caused a lot of astonishment in the Upper Palatinate.
The "Huidlerer" is a rag used to wipe down the oven, the viewers learned.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With this, a gap in education was closed - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I have been unable to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, there is always the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# g#PRS_ORG#n, connected it to the PC, synced and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice for a road bike - really so puncture proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to do at least a little bit of training for my upcoming bike tour next week.
Said and done, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what always happens in every city centre (this time: thanks to Krefeld!) happened.
Shards of glass on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tyre didn't want to play ball for the rest of the race.
As I didn't have a real opportunity to buy a replacement jacket and hose on account of the day of the week, I had to turn around and take the first available train back home.
It wasn't as bad as it could have been, perhaps it's for the best that I practiced changing the tire before the bike ride.
Now, however, I am faced with a question and I hope that you can help me.
As I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would not like to get this problem again and again.
Now it wasn't so bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who came to pick up the bike the day I picked it up at 14:00 and rode 120 km that day!) and the one who also described them as suboptimal, because he had been riding on them for several years on a roller.
But when I think about the fact that I still have to change a tire after 80-90 km, then I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I was talking to an older man at the platform who asked me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres, which are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now it all sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40€ per tyre just to be disappointed in the end.
I'm still wondering: I have 25x622 on my road bike at the moment.
They are also available (apparently?) for the Marathon Plus tyres, but most of them are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to go for other tyres on a racing bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to be leaning more towards the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and best wishes!
Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had collided with a central reservation on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten and then crashed onto the wrong side of the road, police said.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then thrown against a tree and the man in the car was crushed.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old co-driver were seriously injured in the accident and were taken to nearby hospitals.

After the publication of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series also received new members.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and resembles optically the big predecessors with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this design proposal, a suitable foot is included as part of the design, to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted to the given circumstances at home in terms of length.
Principally, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people who don't care much about the maximum volume, but want to achieve an exceptionally high sound level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not capable of generating such large sound pressure levels unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and for her size extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was voiced with a slight high-frequency lift.
This is common practice for wideband antennas in order to optimize the strong increase in concentration due to the high frequencies.
Exactly aimed at the listening position, the SOLO 15 delivers a very clear and fine sound.
Turned slightly outward, the high-frequency range can be reduced to warm up the sound.
Thanks to the point source, locating the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM result in a foe dynamics that is hard to beat.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and precision.
As with all of our kits, it is a good idea to think about the final look of the speaker at the beginning, so that appropriate changes can be made during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the enclosure, the speaker must be lowered accordingly, as the veneer adds material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at a hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the corresponding location to be able to easily run the cable there later.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be installed flush.
On the back, this opening should be milled with a 45° bevel to maximize the opening area of the speaker chassis inside.
The four fastening points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the flange, as shown in the image "Detail Fase".
Then one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of oneself.
Now the back, the lid, the front and the bottom are glued on.
The three reinforcements should also be installed and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in thickness as needed, if, for example, you want to use prefabricated strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front, follow.
Using a suitable drill bit or Forstner bit, the holes for the bass reflex tube and the connection clamp on the back wall are made easier.
After that, one uses a cylindrical grinder to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded with this.
The foot plate is then glued firmly to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
The next step is to mark and pre-drill (2.5 mm drill) the mounting points of the speaker chassis and the connection clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuum / blow), the laying of the cable begins.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
This involves pushing the entire and uncut cable through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening and leaving it protruding for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it hang loose there as well.
The following is the preparation and installation of the frequency converter.
The construction plan of the frequency changer, as well as the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Installation manual Solo 15.
If the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the inside of the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
The 35 mm bASSREFLEX aperture can be sealed by dropping hot glue onto the aperture.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the sealing can be checked accordingly.
Now the damping according to the description follows.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and fastened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a piece of damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello to all,
We can finally announce that we will be holding the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, due to known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the switch, so we will be able to stream the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans and hopefully thousands of you watching!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic, so we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Put some drinks in the fridge, plan some good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
