From my point of view, the literature program was developed by middle-aged ladies on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very same middle-aged ladies.
And the psychology and suffering of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
It's rare for teenagers to be interested in the psychology of the characters.
Thanks a lot, it's very interesting.
Were the roses plush to represent a certain type of rose?
There are roses of such a color and with such a petal structure resembling velvet, usually of dark red, burgundy shades.
And the white roses look different, the petals have a satiny or silky sheen.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige mattress 105x195.
The "Micropack Prestige" model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different firmness sides: the medium-firm surface is made of latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, the medium-soft surface is made of natural latex foam.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square metre adapts quickly to the body of the sleeper, preventing the "waviness" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for ventilation, is well-ventilated naturally, like coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate is maintained in the sleeping area.
Also, the mattress is covered by an extended warranty.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the mattress lasts longer.
The dust and dirt protection is provided by the removable jacquard cover included in the package.
Get an orthopaedic pillow to go with your mattress - they are recommended to help maintain the correct position of your spine while you sleep.
The filling determines the purpose of the pillow - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, while latex relaxes the muscles.
Turn on your brain and get rid of such relatives!
Better to have none than such...

Andrey, they explained to you that in schools there are pensioners, they will not work in the command line.
The computer science teacher won't be able to help either, he wasn't taught this, schoolchildren play games on Windows.
So there's no support.
I remember those dinners and the guests at my parents' house with horror.
Guests are at the door, and the meat patties are still being fried on the stove, while the mother is frantically mopping the floor.
Lord, I was so exhausted by the time I got to the table.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday you haul in the groceries, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning up afterwards.
And the guests?
They're happy, and there's always a cake to take home with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays and guests.
Even for my family, I set the table with the bare minimum.
And I make them treats, I bake them often just for the fun of it.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccination inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed vigour.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, it is likely that two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will not be enough to provide full protection.
Ulrich Weigeldt, head of the Association of General Practitioners, is convinced of this.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, by Die Welt.
“We expect that a fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer, at the latest in the autumn”, the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with influenza vaccination".
This will help to achieve the best results.
Besides, enhanced vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus "Omicron" strain.
In particular, the new variant is especially dangerous.
Thus, the risk of reinfection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
As a result, the manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
The companies note that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new "Omicron" variant of the coronavirus.
BioNTech and Pfizer's study showed that the effectiveness of two doses of the vaccine is significantly lower: "neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron strain,” said BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts are urging the acceleration of the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the president of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates for shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, as Salzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta variant and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience is very convincing in this regard,” the expert emphasized.
Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the Pontoon21® company.
It (and the Kalikana Vib series) is different from many other vibes in that it was designed with ice fishing in mind, rather than just casting.
These vibes have a greater weight than their close-sized counterparts, which, undoubtedly, has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper lip made of strong and flexible plastic, which creates additional vibrations during vertical and horizontal presentations.
As a "winter wobbler" Bet-A-Vib performs quite aggressively.
Often the most productive is the simple monotonous animation, i.e. the movement of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in limited space, overgrown with underwater vegetation, snags, and other obstacles that can cause a snag.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when fishing for winter pike and large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when a precise and aggressive presentation of the bait is required.
Reaching the end of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly reverses course and returns to its original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib works just as well for winter trout fishing in a pond.
To please her whims, you can choose between two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game can provoke a passive pike, which does not react even to a live bait.
Bet-A-Vib shows distance and accuracy when casting.
This wobbler is easy to understand and not fussy, and works well with monofilament line and braided line even of large diameters.
For casting for pike, perch, roach or perch, in addition to the even keeper, the "step" is also effective, sometimes with "chirping" on the bottom.
If you are fishing in snaggy areas, you can change the front treble to a double, which will reduce the chances of getting snagged.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most durable and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success on relatively shallow and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young layabouts are sitting on the necks of their old parents.
The "Golden Youth" are clearly defined slackers, who know nothing and can do nothing.

I have never seen a pair of shoes in this shop that I wanted to buy.

Libya says 7,000 Russian mercenaries are in the country
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner" in Libya.
This was announced by the head of the Supreme State Council of the republic, Khaled al-Mishri, on Sunday, December 12.
Currently, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company Wagner in Libya.
They also have planes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets based at Ghardabiya airbase (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," he said, according to Anadolu Agency.
Haleed al-Misri also said that Russian mercenaries were "trying to take over" central Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their man to power" in Central African Republic.
Stay Present
According to the source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya."
The Wagner Group has been operating in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and a port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, the agency notes.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group is backed by the Kremlin.
Where else could mercenaries be?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is allegedly operating in nine African countries - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, "Wagner's" subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of natural resources and raw materials, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in any law enforcement agencies or in the registry of legal entities, and its fighters are not listed in the personnel lists.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Recall that earlier, the ambassadors of 27 EU countries approved sanctions against Wagner.
It is expected that the Council of the European Union will approve this decision on December 13.
Situation in Libya
The High State Council of Libya de-facto is the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions with the dominating Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the parliamentary and presidential elections to at least February 2022.
“With less than two weeks to go until the election, the chances of it being held on time are rapidly diminishing”, the article notes.
In this context, the Higher National Election Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Russia's foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% see more failures.
“Examples of success – ‘in Syria we defended, restored peace there’, ‘Nord Stream-2 decision’, ‘we scared the whole world with powerful weapons’, ‘we took Crimea’.
The main failures are the "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", and "isolation from the world", according to the study of the "Public Opinion Foundation".
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paperwork - all government services have also become only digital
The Government of Dubai has announced a complete shift away from paper-based processes and towards digital technologies.
All state services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the Emirati information agency WAM.
“Today marks the start of a new phase in the digitisation of all aspects of Dubai’s life – we have completed the transition to a paperless government,” Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai Executive Council, said on Saturday.
Now, the internal and external document flow in all government institutions in Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The novelty affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, the police, municipal authorities, courts and so on. The government's initiative was also supported by many commercial structures.
Dubai's transition to e-government and digitization of document flow began in 2018.
Over that time, it is estimated that 336 million sheets of paper have been saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Earlier, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, the dates of birth and how old the child is, that's crazy, and the class and group in the kindergarten too.
Well, I don't believe in such a thing.
And if they do exist, they clearly don't care about anything, including the family.

First they knocked on the door, then on the window, then they decided not to be polite and broke the window and got in, but the grandfather had a baseball bat, which they got.
These people knew for sure that there was someone at home...
Turkey's car production and exports fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the lira's depreciation.
As a result, the industry's performance at the end of 11 months was worse than last year's, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November, 115 thousand cars were produced in Turkey, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
Approximately 75,9 thousand vehicles were exported, which is more than 25% below the previous year's figure.
And if, according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey was demonstrating a positive trend compared to the previous year, then, according to the results of the 11 months of 2021, the production of cars turned out to be 0.3% lower than the previous year's figure.
The reason for such a fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November depreciated by 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a fall in economic activity across all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received loan repayment deferrals in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation with the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports a correspondent for MIA "Kazinform".
According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, in accordance with the instructions of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency of April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On approval of the procedure for granting postponement of payments on loans to small and medium-sized businesses" was adopted, wrote Alikhan Smailov in his reply to the deputy's inquiry.
He reminded that the procedure for granting deferrals on loan repayments stipulated that banks and microfinance organizations would grant deferrals on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to small and medium-sized businesses, including individual entrepreneurs, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the SME subject.
In the borrower's statement, another postponement period may have been indicated.
During the moratorium on the debtor, the creditor's pre-trial work, notice of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended," the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
In 2021, 603 micro, small and medium-sized business borrowers submitted applications for loan repayment deferrals, of which 553 micro, small and medium-sized business borrowers received loan repayment deferrals for a total of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) applied for deferment, of which deferment was provided to 95 MSMEs for a total of 105.8 million tenge," Akylbek Smaylov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryashev suggested that people with a weak immune system can easily cope with the "omicron" strain
A doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be able to cope with it better than those with a strong immune response
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the "omicron" strain of the coronavirus may be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions of the emergence of the virus.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an infected with HIV or immunocompromised person.
In other words, when the mutation occurred, there was no resistance from the immune system.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response from the immune system, it became very fast.
Apparently, there are more of these spike proteins, thorns, there may be more than should be, their antibodies were not trimmed during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be able to cope better with "omicron" than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that the strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's how it is with pneumococcal infections, when the young people aged 30 die, and the elderly aged 60 survive in the form of a cough.
The immune response of rabies in a young person is completely inappropriate: there, where you could only wave a finger, he hits like a cannon at sparrows - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to only alleviate the symptoms - all hope is on the body.
The first sign of a developing pneumonia is the onset of intoxication of the body - this is the temperature, weakness, fatigue.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, a feeling of constriction in the throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also signal a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year, children aged 12 to 18 may begin to be vaccinated.
The virologist and head of the Laboratory of Genomic Engineering at the MIPT, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category of people suffers a lot from COVID-19.
For teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is at its maximum.
This is the most socially active layer, just like preschool children, said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the Laboratory of Genomic Engineering at the MIPT, to "Moscow 24".
Huge thanks to the author for this article.

Immunologists propose why people with obesity become COVID-19 victims
The authors studied fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells in the fat tissue, the macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also studied fat tissue from patients who died of COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system.
SARS-CoV-2 may also be capable of this.
Biologist explains the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin named the reasons for the appearance of dementia and told about ways to prevent it in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, the person finds it increasingly difficult to orient themselves even in familiar surroundings.
Goloshekin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
On the behavioural level, factors such as social isolation and a lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by bad habits - smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, disruption of the sleep regime and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, the inability to concentrate and a decrease in abstract thinking.
“There is a discussion that hearing loss may be an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease, or one of the risk factors for its onset”, the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Earlier, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurology and Medical Genetics of FGKOU VO RNIMU named
N.I. Pirogov, the head of the department of cognitive disorders at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies, Anna Bogolepova, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returns about 30,000 artefacts illegally removed from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Egyptian government has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, in the air of the Al-Hayat TV channel by the head of the Department of Restored Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, Egypt has managed to repatriate 29,300 artefacts.
This year alone, the Museum of the Bible in Washington has uncovered 5,300 artifacts from ancient Egyptian civilization," he said.
Abdel Gaouad clarified that all the artifacts smuggled out of the country are registered in the archives.
The department's staff are currently working on their repatriation to Egypt.
In particular, the experts "track auctions around the world and online sales through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks."
The chief inspector said that upon their return, the cultural artifacts are restored and then put on display in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was the ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun that was sold at an auction in London.
On July 4, auction house Christie's sold a 3,000-year-old bust for $5.97 million (about 680 million roubles).
This angered Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally removed from the Karnak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the guise of the sun god Amon, has been in a private collection since 1985 and has not been put up for auction since then.
It is not known how the relic made its way to Europe.
Egypt has been actively pursuing the repatriation of antiquities illegally removed from the country in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
“The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account” – and this is correct, because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a separate people (similar to Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
The only thing that unites them is the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to staff's personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse is requiring its staff to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The reason for this is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees because they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if a staff member used it for a meeting with a client that had not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, with many staff working from home, the bank wants to extend the rule to all devices used for work purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management set a deadline for employees to familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse is not commenting on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was a productive one in terms of his creativity, but a difficult one for the poet and his "ego".
He's already outside of any literary associations, he's split with imaginism, he's a loner, but he's known, he's in demand, he's sometimes severely criticized by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their shoulders.
Over the course of the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of which are true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Russia".
And the main success was at the end of June 1925, when Gosizdat signed a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
No contemporary poet has been accorded such an honour, he is the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the monthly fee was 1000 rubles for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles a month, an engineer - 200).
The money was needed more than ever that year.
Esenin married Sofia Tolstoy, the great-granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, it was necessary to set up the family home, maintain the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
It seemed like life was getting back on track, there was a lot to be happy about, but for him everything was tinged with a dark hue, as if the nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published posthumously) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Maybe it's just the wind whistling
Above the empty and desolate field,
Or, like a grove in September,
Alcohol clouds the mind.
Many of his acquaintances noted that he looked very ill, that he had lost a lot of weight, and that he was clearly ill.
Repeated failures, nervous breakdowns are becoming more frequent.
And the reason, probably, is not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergey Aleksandrovich by anyone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, relating to May 1923, when Yessenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan, was recovering his health in a clinic in Paris under the supervision of Professor Pavel Gannushkin (he would return to him two years later, already in Moscow).
However, there are plenty of testimonies of the poet's drunkenness, scandals on this account, and arrests by the police - scattered across dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 1920s, the terrible romance of the poet with the green serpent developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yessenin lived for a short time with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
It is surprising, but, despite his very good income, Yessenin never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he had to live in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
Starcev recalls:
He would come only to sleep, and most of the time in an incoherent, drunken state.
One night, returning home at four in the morning, Yessenin fell on the landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
Coming to his senses, he began to cough uncontrollably, splattering the entire bed with blood..."
And even himself, after the tour of Europe and the United States (there was prohibition in the United States at that time, but Duncan took a good supply of alcohol with her), confessed:
“I saw nothing there but taverns and streets...
I'm already at the end and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, he did drink, of course...
I drank because loneliness had gnawed at me."

Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern interpretation of a budget model in the premium class.
The base of the mattress is a block of independent double springs Duet.
A smaller spring is fitted inside the larger spring.
This allows the load to be evenly distributed across the mattress.
The mattress is complemented on both sides with a filling - artificial latex.
It is a substitute for natural latex, but it is denser and cheaper.
The flexibility and resilience of this material increases the comfort of the mattress.
Synthetic latex is hypoallergenic, it does not absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress is well suited to a couple with a large weight difference (over 30 kilograms).
Thanks to the "smart" springs, there is no effect of the wave here, when the light partner slides to the side of the heavy one.
The pleasant, soft-to-the-touch cover of the practical Jacquard Sense is stitched with a layer of synthetic filling.
Natural fabrics do not collect static electricity.
It is possible to manufacture this mattress model in a rolled-up version (vacuum roll packaging).
Now, his son is almost 16, and he hasn't been tempted to cheat for a long time.
All the energy is focused on choosing what he will be doing to earn a living.
He's a lot more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had occasional run-ins with the law right up until the wedding.
The father cares for his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love."
Why did the girl cry on the exam when she hadn't even failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't a school.
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
He'll retake.
Millions of students know this.
What on earth are you talking about?
Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapons"
The Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland, Pawel Jablonski, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as "weapons" against the European Union and intends to return to this "operation" in the next year.
In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, the deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a corresponding statement.
According to Jabłoński, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively looking for new ways."
Also, the Polish official is sure that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many places around the world."
As KP.RU reported earlier, the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It targeted 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe has announced its readiness to continue expanding restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
In response, Minsk introduced a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

“Not by Semyon’s hat”: when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughing stock
The 2021 social events were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
At the premiere of the film "No Time to Die" in September, he appeared in a plum-colored velvet jacket and a traditional "Bond-style" tie.
He was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore an inappropriate green velvet jacket to the Earthshot Prize ceremony, and then opted for a more traditional option for the Royal Variety performance.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messi also tried on the trend.
The footballer came to collect his seventh 'Golden Ball' in a Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the analysts of the service, their sales have increased by 1.4 times.
The most popular are warm velvet blazers with lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - suits they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, suits made of velvet are presented almost in all brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, Saint Laurent.
The most coveted is the Gucci model, in which Jared Leto, the brand's ambassador, debuted at one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci".
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technique, a dense fabric with a fuzzy outer texture and a smooth inner side is produced.
The cheaper varieties are made from cotton or polyamide, but they also last less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhonskiy warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, it is not the model or style that is important, but the appropriateness.
“Barathea demands evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a formal event, explains Vahovskiy. It will also work for those occasions where the dress code is Black Tie or Creative Black Tie.
Another important criterion, which allows to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
“A man in a velvet jacket, first and foremost, must acquire a proper advanced crowd with a surplus,” the authors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion “Brammell’s Beauty” believe. “Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the category of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to formal social events, where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhonskiy recommends pairing a barathea jacket with other festive items: classic trousers with pleats, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with pom-poms, cufflinks.
Things that are too common and mundane will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Bramhall's Beauty Spot" are convinced that it would be inappropriate for a regular employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if it's the "boss of those who are running this event", then "yes", he would be right to wear such a thing.
If the subordinate is lower in rank, and his goal is to move up the ladder in a complicated hierarchy of the company or to get financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion are sure that the management will definitely appreciate the phrase "not like Semyon's hat".
Very mixed feelings about the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, it's so labored.
And it has absolutely nothing to do with the cute face of a young girl.
Honestly, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you success in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, which means it is well-paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, electricity prices have gone up.
Traditional energy is also not spared - and gas, and oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is a huge demand for fuel.
Pennies are dropping.
So who's in the lead?
As usual, a regular shopper.
Does the sheriff care about Indian problems?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who have slept through the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good wage.
I didn't see a single attractive person in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within the parameters of the average passenger.
Perhaps, if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, they won't sit down with them, most likely.
But only because of their mental illness and ignorance, not because of their looks.
Kazbek, "a slave who recognizes his slave status and fights against it is a revolutionary.
A slave who is unaware of his slavery, and who vegetates in a silent, unconscious, and wordless slavery, is simply a slave.
A slave who gushes with saliva when he self-righteously describes the pleasures of slavery and exults in a good and benevolent master is a slave, a boor."
Immunologist says that re-vaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the "Omicron" coronavirus strain
Revaccination after four to five months may protect against the new coronavirus "Omicron" strain.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the six-month vaccination period, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
“Previously, such a period was normal, but now it is better to perform the procedure after five months, and people with chronic diseases – after four”, the expert said, calling for parallel to the vaccination campaign, re-vaccination.
Kruchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person has received two vaccinations and a booster, or if he has recovered and been vaccinated, or if he has been vaccinated and recovered, then he has a ‘hybrid immunity’, which means that there are a lot of antibodies and they are neutralizing enough”, the expert clarified.
G7 warns Russia of 'massive consequences' if it invades Ukraine
The countries of the G7 (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France, and Japan) have issued a joint statement following the meeting of the heads of foreign ministries in Liverpool.
It stresses that "military aggression" by Russia against Ukraine "will have grave consequences and cost dearly" to Moscow, but no specific measures are described in the document.
“We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine,” the statement reads.
Next, the ministers call on Russia "to de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and uphold its international obligations on transparency of military activities," as President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with the aim of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the foreign ministers of the G7 also say.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that any further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and serious costs in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign nation to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's measured approach.
We will intensify our cooperation in our common and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, said that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which very clearly made it clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine deemed 32 times less effective against omicron variant
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron variant of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than against other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, as reported by South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective on the basis of antiviral activity among citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 treatment.
“We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original SARS-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the Omicron variant,” said Professor Malik Payis.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way of protecting against a severe course of the disease when infected with a coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of a pandemic of the coronavirus, taking into account the influence of the omicron strain.
The authors of the study came to the conclusion that the omicron strain may cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
Ukraine's defense minister accuses Germany of blocking NATO weapons shipments to Kyiv
Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Ukraine's purchase of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and anti-drone rifles last month.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kyiv intends to acquire the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, it concerns the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that Germany's new government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has yet to take a clear position on whether to allow arms exports to Ukraine.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect weapons deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of escalation of the conflict in Donbass despite the "occupation by Russia" of a part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine hopes that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

G7 Warns Russia of Responsibility for Invasion of Ukraine
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries have warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, as stated in the final communique of the parties.
Participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces near the country's borders.
“Russia should have no doubt that any further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs”, the statement published on the British government’s website said.
The ministers of the G7 and the EU High Representative noted that they were "united in their condemnation of Russian military escalation and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss has warned of "significant consequences" for Russia if it invades Ukraine at a press conference in Liverpool.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to abandon its aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier at the G7 summit in Liverpool, the ministers of foreign affairs of the G7 agreed that in order to resolve the crisis caused by the buildup of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties must return to the negotiating table.
It was about negotiations in the "Normandy format".
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) also called for dialogue on Ukraine in the "Normandy format."

Ways to recover stolen money from online shops have been revealed
There are several ways to recover money stolen from online stores and avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
Their secrets were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBK.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of large losses in the event of the card data falling into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to store the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used for online shopping.
Some savings can be set aside in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen from purchases made in stores that do not use the 3D Secure security technology, it is possible to initiate a refund procedure.
“In accordance with the rules established by payment systems, liability for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure falls on the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service”, a representative of Promsvyazbank clarified.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that the buyer has the right to file a complaint with the bank within 120 days of the purchase to dispute a fraudulent transaction.
In addition, if the perpetrator used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the money to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, the member of the Public Chamber, the director of the League of Safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulina reported that only in 2021, 11 thousand applications were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine, and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz has stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for the long term, the leaders of the two countries have expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to oppose the "Nord Stream-2" pipeline, through which it is planned to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline as a means of political pressure against Europe.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
However, Poland's judicial system remains one of the points of contention.
The European Court ruled that Poland's judicial reforms, carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party, violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new German government sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, did not take on public commitments to stop the Nord Stream 2 project in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told congressional members that they have reached an understanding with Germany that Nord Stream 2 will be stopped if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violates the Ukrainian border, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the "Big Seven" on Sunday.
Dmitry, pay more attention.
The view outside is the same, the size of the window hasn't changed.
They removed the wall between the kitchen and the living room, so you can see the second window.
Those who are not familiar with the initial layout are doubtful.
And I know very well such apartments and I can see how they have been replanned.
Let them be happy.
It always surprises me when they write about cleaning means for sinks, toilets, window sills, faucets.
You wash them once a year, on Easter, that is, you have to actually wash them.
Just don't get dirty.
The Ministry of Digital Development wants to give writers residences
The future Foundation for the Support of Russian Literature will receive federal property inherited from the Union of Soviet Writers and the Literary Fund of the Soviet Union.
Its basis will be used to create writer's residences, the "Parliamentary newspaper" reported, citing the Ministry of Digital Development, which will become the foundation's founder.
The Ministry of Digital Development and Communications is preparing a draft presidential decree on the creation of the Foundation for the Support of Russian Literature.
The explanatory note clarifies that the fund will be tasked, among other things, with taking care of the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures, once belonging to the Soviet Writers' Union and the Literary Fund.
“A significant amount of immovable property previously belonging to the Literary Fund of the USSR has been transferred to the ownership of the Russian Federation, including properties located in the Writers’ Village of Peredelkino, the village of Komarovo in the Leningrad region, and others”, the press service of the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media reported to the “Parliamentary Gazette”.
The project of the decree stipulates that the Foundation's charter should reflect that it "is created for the purpose of promoting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers."
“‘Creating conditions for creative activity’ means creating writer’s residences in different regions of Russia on the basis of the transferred property, which would provide comfortable conditions for creative work”, explained the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media to our publication.

Doctors warn of the danger of prolonged use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned of the danger of uncontrolled use of blood-thinning drugs after a coronavirus infection COVID-19 and before vaccination against coronavirus.
Irina Yartseva, a therapist and immunologist, told that independent prevention of possible thrombosis formation after COVID-19 may cause a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood-thinning drugs are not for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in the hospital, and had complications.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood-thinning medications that prevent excessive formation of clots) as needed.
She said that now there is hysteria - everyone is taking anticoagulants for a long time and getting complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (brain hemorrhage).
The chief epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District, the scientific leader of the Society of Specialists in Preventive Medicine, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev told URA.RU in an interview that people in Russia often use anticoagulants haphazardly and before getting vaccinated against the coronavirus.
According to Dr Tokarev, citizens believe in dubious advice on the Internet and start self-medicating.
There are such citizens who, on their own initiative, start taking anticoagulants a week before the vaccination.
And during the preliminary examination before the vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found the money in the church wall will be paid 20,000 dollars
The plumber who found money in a Texas church wall will be paid a reward.
This is reported in the press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches that devout Christians will be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cole was repairing one of the church's toilets and found thousands of pounds in cash and cheques under the insulation.
He turned the find over to the church, he said, and did not receive even a thank-you from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done,"" he told KPRC-TV.
It appears the find is connected to a theft that occurred at the Lakewood church seven years ago.
At the time, about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks were stolen from the church's safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25,000 dollars was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cole was ineligible to receive this amount because the award's term had expired.
Despite this, the non-profit Crime Stoppers of Houston, which initially offered a $5,000 reward and later received a $20,000 donation from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
It was previously reported that police had questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - these are her characteristics "as a real person".
Therefore, the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it's not about the fact that "she is financially much richer than all the writers," as it is written here.
There are people who are richer than her, but not all of them behave so arrogantly, so provocatively.

Somehow, I trust you more than just recipes from the Internet.
China reports new case of human infection with bird flu virus
A new case of human infection with a highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N6 strain has been reported in China.
This was reported by the RTHK radio station with reference to the notification of the Hong Kong Department of Health, TASS reports.
A 68-year-old man from the Huizhou prefecture in southern Guangdong province, who kept poultry at home, has been infected with the disease.
His condition is described as critical by doctors.
The first human infection with the H5N6 strain was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports upon entering the country
A judge of the Federal Supreme Court (STF) of Brazil, Luis Roberto Barroso, ordered the requirement of a COVID-19 passport for those entering the territory of the country.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate if they have contraindications to vaccination.
People arriving from countries where the vaccine has not been proven to exist are also excluded from the list.
“The situation is even more serious if you take into account that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which means an increase in tourist flow”, said Barroso.
Earlier, the authorities of Brazil obliged unvaccinated tourists against the coronavirus to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme for full protection from COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation Anatoly Altstein in a conversation with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of full protection from a coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting the vaccine and using a nasal vaccine.
When administered intranasally, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are formed. This does not occur when the vaccine is administered by injection.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside us, after vaccination, the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies) are formed.
And if you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of IgA and IgG antibodies. But there is no decision on dual vaccination yet," the doctor said.
The chief epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of nasal vaccination combined with injectional vaccination is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help, as in such a case, the body's defense, presumably, should become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseynov, said that the new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic will be caused by the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, such a picture is observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to the male (he died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to give up a warm home, feeding, affection, love and games for a bitch in heat, go ahead.
But the pesel was a well-trained and intelligent fellow.
I chose my society and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I slowed down many owners so they wouldn't run after the dog, although they claimed that, look, 200,000 are running away (pomskies), I just took their hand and led them in a different direction.
In the end, "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog that was running somewhere.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe
More than 40,000 protesters took to the streets of Vienna, the Austrian capital.
They expressed their dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the government's plans to make vaccination against COVID-19 compulsory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the government's health care policies, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards reading "This is a false pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A large protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the COVID certificate is mandatory to access bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night-time entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was taken by the authorities of a number of regions of the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of infection with the coronavirus.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters took to the streets to protest against the tightening of restrictions and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with the police.
A group of protesters began throwing rocks at police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia, there is no consensus.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also described as "the first Russian doctor of medicine," probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue about it, I think they both deserve it.
But I agree with Ms. Zakharova on one thing: the Americans brought only death and plunder to any country where they appeared.

WHO detects "omicron" already in dozens of countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron" has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already warned that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The speed of the spread of the strain was reported by the WHO in a statement.
According to the organization's data as of December 9, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This, despite the fact that it became active only at the end of November.
The WHO also expressed concern about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
The WHO experts are concerned that the new strain, based on preliminary data, may outstrip the spread of the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Previously, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also been reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will overtake "delta" in the next few months.
And the number of those infected in Britain alone is expected to be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "Omicron" is currently affecting several hundred people in the Kingdom, and up to 10,000 according to estimates.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omicron" strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be admitted to hospitals every day.
Which the NHS will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from the company Pfizer-BioNTech against the "Omicron" strain is 32 times lower than against other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" vaccine will react to the "Omicron" variant - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has only just begun testing the Russian vaccine against the "Omicron" strain.

Curious Squirrel, you're right, online communication is completely different, it's easy and unpretentious, and when you meet in person, there's nothing to say.
And in real life, seeing a person, maybe it's not what you expected, it didn't grab you - that's where the attitude comes from.
When he meets his person, then the eyes will change.
And again, the Soviet era is called "the time of demons."
Well, then, people believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
And they were brought up pretty much according to God's laws (love your neighbor, don't steal, etc.).
What is today's ideology - money at any cost.
Skeptics like Globa have little faith (if any at all), but even if so, the time of the devil has come in the 1990s...
Our Leningrad, or rather Petersburg, communal flat on Bolshaya Zeleninaya is still in touch.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain a warm relationship with the older generation.
Maybe it's because there were no guests, the rooms weren't rented out, and the blockade brotherhood hasn't been abolished.
Sadly, we see each other more and more at funerals.

Human babies, especially males, are strong, active, energetic, boisterous, pushing, fighting, wrestling, just like their little "siblings" in the natural world!

And for what?

In Brazil, seven people have died as a result of flooding
At least seven people have died and 175 have been injured as a result of heavy rainfall that hit the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and the neighboring state of Minas Gerais.
This was reported by TASS with reference to the rescue services.
Since the middle of the week, a mid-latitude cyclone has been raging on the border of these states, resulting in the region receiving 450 mm of rainfall. In 25 municipalities in the state of Bahia, a state of emergency has been declared, with flooding becoming the most destructive in 35 years in some of them.
Several bridges, two river dams and traffic on three highways have been disrupted.
According to the rescuers, about 5,7 thousand people were left without a roof, and another 6,7 thousand were forced to leave their homes.
The disaster affected more than 85,000 residents of the region.

US$135 billion went to apps - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending in apps grew by 25% worldwide, while downloads grew by 8%.
The most popular in the world turned out to be various video services.
Most users downloaded the video editor CapCut, and spent the most on YouTube.
And the number of downloads of apps, and the expenditure of users in them showed a significant growth in the period from January to November 2021.
Downloads grew 8% to 140 billion, while spending by users in apps grew 25% to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the world economy emerged from lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.
“Will such a ‘return to physical’ growth slow down the economy of apps? Not at all”, the authors of the report say.
India is the country with the highest number of app downloads, accounting for about 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS devices still spent more than Android users: iOS accounted for 65% of all spending in apps.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took first place by the number of downloads in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps: the video service MX TakaTak and the online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram is also included in the top 10 for the number of downloads.
In general, if judged by the number of downloads, VPN services (there are two in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and video-related services (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, there are two more such services - Moj and SnackVideo) are popular among users.
“Users spent the most time in live-streaming and online-streaming apps,” note the authors of the report.
Leading here is YouTube, followed by TikTok, streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, and the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok occupy the first places by the number of monthly active users, and the mobile version of Microsoft Office closes the top five.
In Russia, the shopping app AliExpress was the leader in terms of downloads in 2019.
Followed by Zenly, which shows the location of friends, and the same CapCut.
Also in the top 10 apps are: the online karaoke app StarMaker, the online retailer of clothing Shein, the Maps for Minecraft PE online service, the DiDi online taxi ordering service, the Pure Tuber YouTube client, the Dixi online store, and the Samokat online store.
People around the world have adapted to the pandemic by going mobile, which is one of the main takeaways.
Those industries that helped people be closer, both virtually and in person, have been the most successful," said Lexi Sydow, director of market research at App Annie, commenting on the report's findings.
The mobile gaming sector generated $90 billion in revenue in 2021. Leaders in terms of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, which have little or no plot, and minimal video formatting.
The top three most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover, and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the most popular games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls, and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of the next year, analysts of the company named the growth of the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growth of popularity among the generation Z of financial applications, for example, the Robinhood investment application, as well as the further growth of popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warned of new scam by fraudsters
Scammers are looking for new ways to defraud people in video messages.
This is reported by Izvestia, citing experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, Director of Products at Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings of the victim.
Thanks to this, neural networks are able to accurately reproduce the peculiarities of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, criminals can call a victim's acquaintances via video call or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person for distribution with the aim of blackmail.
“Such counterfeits can easily incite bullying, as a sophisticated perpetrator can place people in ridiculous, dangerous, or embarrassing fake scenarios,” the expert said.
Systems engineer at Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that people are more likely to trust others when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video technologies.
David, I'll add.
In what I have written above, I have focused on the fact that all of this was bought in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow for much make-up and short skirts, showing stockings and tights on the legs.
This is a province, but there was such a product in the store.
In big cities and among Muslims, women dyed their hair and showed their legs.
And here in Dushanbe, this is a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but the same cosmetics are not available.
Five actions to help avoid type 2 diabetes
Diabetes is one of the most common health problems in the world.
However, some people don't take this seriously enough, and that's a shame.
Diabetes can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play the most important role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing your drinking habits - reducing the variety of drinks and switching to plain water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
So the first step on the road to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The disease is not only caused by an unhealthy diet, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Experts recommend following a low-carb diet.
Such a diet not only helps to lose weight, but also protects from sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Fibres fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the secretion of digestive juices and the absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova talks about "weekend migraine" for workaholics
Several factors can lead to deterioration of health on weekends
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often "weekend migraine," said a well-known endocrinologist, a candidate of medical sciences, a senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of MGU, and the scientific leader of the Systemic Medicine Clinic Zhuhra Pavlova in her telegram-channel.
According to her, this is especially common among workaholics, who experience headaches, fatigue, and weakness on the weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the past week, there are enough objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changing conditions.
On weekends, our lives fundamentally change.
“We sleep a lot, we spend the whole day on the sofa, probably we eat more and drink less, - the doctor reasoned. - Due to the lack of coffee, there is a small withdrawal syndrome.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heaviness and fatigue."
An additional factor is the late rise.
For example, if you get up three hours later than usual, you will experience a reaction called jet lag.
It occurs in travellers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which factor is most responsible for the worsening of symptoms, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most over the weekend.

South African scientists say Pfizer vaccine is ineffective against "omicron"
South Africa reports low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Scientists from South Africa conducted a study and reported that the Pfizer vaccine is ineffective against the omicron strain of the coronavirus.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "Omicron") corresponds to (the effectiveness of the vaccine) of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which... casts doubt on the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, according to the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in everyday foods?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
His excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under an unknown ingredient in a product, a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index - may be listed.
The label may contain dozens of names, in essence, indicating sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
Other buried sugars include dextrose (corn sugar), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (blackstrap), agave syrup, and so on.
These are simple carbohydrates, which are mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctors' sausages, in bread and so on.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar intake is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar have different tastes, but no matter what you call the ingredient in a product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it's still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that fruits, vegetables, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Therefore, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the import of gas is losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to become a climate-neutral country by 2045 by completely abandoning gas, oil, and coal.
“That is, after 25 years, the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role,” said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to the fact that Ukraine should transport Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is important for the energy transition at the moment.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which the support of Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine was fixed.
Earlier, the head of the German Foreign Ministry, Annalena Baerbock, said that the certification process for the Nord Stream - 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, within the framework of coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that energy projects should be subject to European energy law.
The diplomat also noted that the pipeline "does not yet comply" with the requirements of the European Union.

Hackers break into Prime Minister of India's Twitter
Hackers broke into Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Twitter account.
The perpetrators managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method, as well as that the country had already purchased cryptocurrency.
In Modi's office, they were asked to ignore the new reports.
Representatives of the Prime Minister said that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
The Prime Minister of India's page has already been hacked in 2020 and called for donations using cryptocurrency.
Majority of New Caledonians vote against independence in referendum
The third referendum held in New Caledonia on 12 December ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755) of those who voted voted in favor of independence for New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participating in the elections.
Commenting on these interim results, the France-Presse agency notes that "the outcome of these elections was never in doubt", as pro-independence supporters called on voters to stay away from the polls.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, arguing that the new outbreak of COVID-19 on the archipelago makes it impossible to hold a full-fledged and "fair" election campaign.
Thus, this abstention paved the way for the third victory of the pro-French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, and in 2020, 53.3%.
The separatists said they do not recognise the results of the last referendum and will contest them at the UN.
According to the Elysee Palace on Sunday, December 12, the President of France Emmanuel Macron will make a speech after the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has revived the last few weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have come out in favor of keeping the territory French, as it is "the last European Union presence in the Pacific Ocean."
“New Caledonia must remain French”, Eric Zemmour has repeatedly said.
Such a statement was also made by Valérie Pécresse, a Republican candidate, who published an article in Le Figaro at the end of October, calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
On the other hand, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, on his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Scots would be a choice for France".
Hey, Svetlana!
I was a little... a lot of a bitch, I'm still embarrassed, I'm still ashamed.

Turkey has successfully tested the world's first drone armed with a laser weapon.
The "Eren" drone was tested at distances of 100 to 500 meters, MIR24 reported.
The device is able to neutralize explosive devices at a distance using a laser.
The maximum altitude of the innovation is 3,000 m.
After passing the relevant tests, the drone is to be put into service with the Turkish military, who will use it to destroy explosive devices without the help of sappers.
The agency stresses that Turkey is one of the six countries in the world capable of developing and manufacturing its own drones.

WSJ Readers Criticize Article on Russia-U.S. Relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the article expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and made a number of insulting statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "stand united against Russia."
The WSJ readers disagreed with the position of the American professor.
“There is a lot of false information in this article”, one of the readers commented, according to RIA Novosti.
“Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," another said.
Patches can also be used on the lips.
The hydrogel used in the production of Dearboo Peach & Hibiscus Brightening Hydrogel Eye Patch is a high-tech polymer that ensures high absorption and transmission of the natural plant essence to the skin, adheres tightly to the skin and gives a feeling of freshness.
By delivering nutrients to the skin, the hydrogel minimizes the accompanying loss of moisture and allows the essence to penetrate deep into the skin.

Earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred near the Kuril Islands
An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred near the Shikotan island of the Kuril Islands.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists registered an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which 10 people were injured.

Ukraine to start producing new-generation unmanned aerial vehicles
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, they will begin to create reactive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced on December 11 by an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian President's Office, Alexei Arestovich.
In other words, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and so on," he was quoted as saying by Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovych said that these are not piston, but rocket drones.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceeds it "in all respects."
The first batch of drones should be produced by the plant by the end of next year, Arestovych concluded.
The ANKA unmanned aerial vehicle was developed by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish government in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the military operations of the combined forces in Donbass.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky announced that construction of a plant for the production of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in the Kyiv region where personnel would be trained, as well as Bayraktar drones would be tested and serviced.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big real step forward."
Two lions escape from shipping container at airport
Two lions have escaped from Singapore's Changi airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it is still unknown where they came from and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions lay on top of a shipping container.
The animals could not get away from it because a protective net had been installed nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all of Singapore's zoos.
They immobilized the lions with darts containing a tranquilizer and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that a lion had escaped from its owner in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, and was roaming the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warn of cancer risk from vitamin B9
Studies have shown that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can cause cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there are strong indications that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular, colorectal cancer.
However, an overdose on the other hand promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to pay attention to the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin advises not to take vitamin B9 in tablet form without a doctor's recommendation, to watch out for dosage and to avoid cereals with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutritionist Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is also found in avocado, Fain recommended that men over 50 eat the fruit more often.
In the UK, up to 75,000 people could die by April due to the omicron variant
British scientists predict that up to 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus, if the restrictions are not tightened this winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian with reference to the study of experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies at the British Cabinet Office, by April 2022, at least 25,000 deaths from the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the epidemic, the hospitals will treat more than 2,000 infected people daily.
“Serious measures to tackle the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the NHS becoming overwhelmed if the omicron variant turns out to be more transmissible than the delta variant, and existing vaccines cannot prevent infection”, said Rosanna Barnard, a mathematician at LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the speed of spread of the omicron strain remains at the current level, then by the end of the year, about 1 million cases of infection will be identified in the country.
At the same time, by the middle of December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
There have been 1,898 cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in the UK so far, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that in reality this figure may already reach 10,000 cases.
I wanted to write some clever comment, but I got as far as this:
“A fur coat obtained as a result of the unimaginable suffering of the unfortunate animal and its employment on a second job”.

Global demand for superyachts rises by a quarter
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking world records despite calls to reduce carbon footprints and fight climate change.
In the World Register of Ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - 25% more than in the previous year.
In an era of climate change mitigation, it's hard to imagine that the number of people with both the desire and the money to buy a floating fortress for $50 million or more won't continue to shrink, The Guardian writes.
However, they are becoming more and more common.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been this kind of frenzy on the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Previously, all these people would go to the office and meet their business partners face-to-face. Now, the vast majority of them work remotely and conduct meetings via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more to have their yacht ready by a year or two earlier.
“People just want freedom, and the super-rich can afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that, in times of austerity, space travel, yachting, or flying on their own private jets are causing resentment in society because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and introducing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, even though they know it will be difficult to do so given the mobility of money.
Meanwhile, it is only the number of superyachts ordered that is impressive, but also their specifications.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 are longer than 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Rokke is building the REV Ocean, a 183-metre yacht.
After launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool," as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the ocean.
On existing superyachts, helicopter pads, open-air cinemas and even a boxing ring have become commonplace. Professor of economic anthropology at the University of Indiana, Richard Wilk, says the carbon footprint of the super-rich is negligible compared to the overall amount of greenhouse gas emissions.
But it has symbolic value, given that there are fewer than 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
It's just another example of super-consumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the carbon footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 a year, the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere in 2018.
However, two-thirds of the emission trail landed on his yacht, the 50-metre Eclipse.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The owners of superyachts do not inspire sympathy when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no berthing space for their giant vessels.
It is also hard to understand her call to build marinas for ships of up to 50 meters.
Dangerous weekly dose of alcohol linked to bowel cancer
American scientists have determined the volume of alcoholic beverages per week that increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that consuming four or more alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, the risk of developing bowel cancer is higher in moderate drinkers than in women.
Scientists are unable to determine the exact cause of the development of such a type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, if not all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they don't realize how advanced their four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out exactly how intelligent animals are.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can react to 89 words or phrases in sequence.
The scientists' findings were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics or art, but they often manage to fool their owners.
Some breeds, according to experts, show better results in understanding human language, but there are not enough statistical data to make precise conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered to be dog geniuses, such as Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of their ability to learn, they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine prepares for US-Russia trade talks
The United States and Russia will "negotiate" the issue of Ukraine's accession to NATO, Alexander Kotsyubynskyi, an analyst, wrote in his article for the "Glavred" publication.
According to him, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations in the near future on guarantees for the United States that Ukraine will not join NATO, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to join anywhere."
If you're offered something obviously unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not going to haggle, you're just going to send the offer.
As far as Ukraine is concerned, a deal is in the offing," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kyiv.
“The preparations are carried out covertly, quickly, and they immediately move to the offensive, not waiting for the group to be detected and the forces of counteraction to be deployed”, he noted.
China promotes the development of the railway transport industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Exhibition and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in the city of Zhuzhou, Hunan Province /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow the trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, said a representative of the company, Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure the reliability and workability of the rolling stock.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. They are designed for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 km/h, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began.
The train will run along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
Trains will start running on this line of the metro next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 km/h.
“China’s railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness,” said Feng Yaoyan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Chamber of Commerce for the Promotion of International Trade /CCPIT/.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of China’s production of high-end equipment in the global market,” said Feng Yaoyan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, China has created a leading equipment manufacturing system for rail transport, with a complete set of auxiliary facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoyan, the country ranks first in the level of electrification of railways and the operating mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin in a conversation with radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive impairments, such as the inability to concentrate, plan, and a decrease in abstract thinking.
Loss of hearing is currently being discussed as both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for its onset, the expert said.
Goloshekin emphasized that dementia can be caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the cerebral arteries are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that, as of today, doctors do not know effective ways of treating dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, the risk of developing dementia can be reduced by studying foreign languages and active communication.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly exercising cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense memory and logic thinking
“There are recommendations for the use of various supplements, but their effectiveness and justification are still being discussed in the scientific community”, said Golosheikhin.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logic thinking”, said Golosheikhin.
Earlier this year, a UK-based dementia research charity said the disease was increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Medics have named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign is problems with vision, which makes it difficult for the patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts say, is aphasia - the inability to find the right words to say what you want to say.
Neurologist demands that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychoneurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze said to journalists, who is a member of the council of doctors created by the ombudsman of Georgia.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the main factor in his illness.
Stability problems include problems with movement, coordination, mood instability," the expert said, noting that this does not go beyond the norm and now the former president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia”, - said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
In the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical care after the penitentiary service subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore his rights.

Protests against COVID passports held in Spain
Protests against compulsory COVID-19 vaccination certificates took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, Europa Press reports.
In the Catalan capital, approximately 3,000 people took part in the action.
In Barcelona, COVID passports are now mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightclubs.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
The slogans on their posters accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required for entry to entertainment venues and restaurants with more than 50 seats.
Protesters in this city have said that there is a medical dictatorship and that vaccination is an experiment.
In Spain, since the start of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of infection with the coronavirus have been identified, more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia also plans to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated.
The government introduced bills on a single QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, objects of public catering and retail trade with the presentation of either a vaccination certificate or a certificate of illness, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will apply to trips on trains and planes.

Steep climb: how Chinese are becoming skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create world-class ski resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to participate in winter sports, which will allow the 1 trillion yuan target set by President Xi Jinping to be achieved, but also contribute to the economic development of backward and remote provinces.
Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the 2022 Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese.
Besides the construction of infrastructure in the region, work is also being done to green the region: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international-level competitions.
In many regions of China, where ski resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The long-term goal is to ensure comfortable and interesting holidays in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
But there is still a long way to go.
Olympic Games adviser Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year, more and more Chinese head for the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to create a skiing culture here, Downs said.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for tourism needs to be created there.
70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Chunli, near the site of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chongli, and now no local resident suffers from unemployment.
The country is seeing the opening of more and more shops selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, they are opening restaurants serving national cuisine.
There's even a COVID-19 testing station on Taivu now.
China is striving to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in major international competitions, and ski resorts and equipment must reach world-class standards.
More than half a billion people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty by the pandemic, WHO says
More than half a billion people around the world could be plunged into extreme poverty as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed progress towards universal health coverage, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank have warned.
In view of the 12 December International Day of Universal Health Coverage, WHO and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the delivery of health care, as well as excessive strain on health care systems.
As a result, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population with immunization has decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the World Bank have noted that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment."
This situation is pushing more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people have little or no social protection.

Reuters:Taiwan minister disconnected from livestream at 'Summit for Democracy' at White House request
Minister of Digital Transformation of Taiwan Audrey Tang's speech at a panel discussion during the U.S. "Summit for Democracy" was muted on video, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, reported that the image was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organisation CIVICUS and ranks countries around the world according to the degree of civil rights protection.
Taiwan was marked as "free" in green, while China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam were marked as "closed" in red.
After the minister showed the map, the image from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note saying that the views of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the policy of the United States government."
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map presented by Taiwan's minister could run counter to Washington's "one China" policy.
One of the sources told the agency that after the presentation of the map, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as an independent country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charitable foundations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund, through which money, obtained through corruption, would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yury Averianov stated that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."
They tell you that they are preparing food, and there is rotten meat everywhere, in fact, the meat stays with the butcher until the last piece.
The classic in journalism is to create a story out of nothing.
They boil not the meat, but the horns and hoofs, obtaining a substance resembling glue.
The finished product looks like a yellow translucent strip with little smell and hard like plastic, and is used as a natural gelatin.
In general, the amount of harmful substances from the recycling of waste is no less than from its decomposition.
But it saves companies a lot of money.
Therefore, the fairy tale about ecology was invented for the fools, who will also work for free for the idea of ​​collecting garbage.
Personally, my contribution to the environment is to not buy things I don't need and to use things for a long time.
If I go over, I don't throw it away, I donate it to charity.

The carrier rocket landed on the launch pad as planned.
Blue Origin successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard ship with passengers on board on July 20.

Don't lump them all together - there are bad people in the world, and you may have grievances against some of them.
But what about the number of children, the age, the pension fund and so on?
Write that they are "scumbags, they didn't return the money."
But when it comes to how many and when they should have children, that's none of your business until they're ready to hang them on your neck.
Well, if that's the case, then what right do you have to judge them?
I guess it's only in education that it's like that...
Chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, blatantly ignoring already existing ones.
And what if it concerns other spheres of life, such as court proceedings and so on?
They don't follow the law.
What if dad does implement his method of upbringing and education?
It's some kind of horror and a bad example for others.

The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic of COVID-19 in cities with land ports of entry in order to further prevent the importation of the infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities must provide a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken within 48 hours of departure.
Those arriving at land border crossings must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day the corresponding administrative units at the provincial level determine and publish the areas of these cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities in which land border crossings are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
The deputy head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Ryabkov, assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington in an interview with Izvestia.
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some kind of improvement in relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
It's a sad conclusion at the end of a long journey that we've been on with the current administration, with Trump, with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems stem from the fact that the United States is trying to impose its approach on Russia on a wide range of issues.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he would not have dared to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not have expected a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, progress has not been made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and that the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of danger of vaccinating with nasal COVID-19 drug outside hospitals
People vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may develop allergic reactions and need medical assistance, so the first vaccination points for this vaccine should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS by the virologist, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
It's easier to set up nasal vaccination points in airports and shopping centres, but I would do it only in medical institutions at first.
The thing is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but it is desirable for the person to sit next to the doctor's office after this.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that work within a minute or two, which can sometimes be very useful," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when there will be experience in using the drug.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated sneezes after the nasal spray.

Serbia produces 2 million doses of "Sputnik V" vaccine

Serbia has produced around 2 million doses of Russia's "Sputnik V" vaccine, the country's Minister of Innovation and Technological Development Nenad Popovic told TASS.

Because if they can say about themselves that they are true believers, they can say the same about others.

This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the "Omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with the new variant in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people in the UK infected with the new strain of COVID-19 has reached 3,137.

Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" into the territory of the country.
“It is impossible to impose some restrictions on Russia and not suffer oneself”, the official representative of the Kremlin said in an interview with the TV channel “Russia 1”.
Peskov asserts that this is "understood by everyone in the world."
Earlier, it was reported that the United States is considering introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is convinced that this is impossible.

Ksenia, you don't have to explain anything to my mind, my mind has to figure it out on its own!
“The inability of the mind, divided with the Spirit, to apprehend” – what are you talking about?!
Imagine you have to explain this to a child who doesn't know any better, how are you going to do that?!
Keep in mind that a child up to 3-5 years old still has open channels of communication with the subtle world, and the child may know more than you!
New Caledonians reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, an overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the French state.
This was reported by the French television channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of those who voted voted against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
2.99% of ballots were annulled.
Voter turnout was very low that day: only about 55% of the archipelago's residents went to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by separatist calls to boycott the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to move the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the people of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
A referendum on independence was held in the region in 2018.
The majority of the inhabitants supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 km from the mainland of France.
France annexed New Caledonia in 1853.
About 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative-territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian government allows the region to hold a referendum on its independence every two years with a two-year gap between votes.

WHO considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there are data on a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the case of infection with the new COVID-19 variant.
As of 9 December, "Omicron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigen profile of the "Omicron" strain suggest a reduction in vaccine efficacy against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it ("severity of disease" - ed.) may be less severe than during "delta"," the WHO said in a technical bulletin.
The organisation notes that all cases of "omicron" infection reported in the EU so far have been mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the "delta" variant.
Two cases of omicron variant infection have been registered in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center said.
The head of the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor), Anna Popova, stated that there are no reliable data on the fact that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine names four scenarios for Zelensky
Former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four possible scenarios for President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, as well as, possibly, make concessions on the Donbass.
About this on Sunday, December 12, Denisenko wrote in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called the "perfect storm," assumes that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kyiv may face in 2023.
“At the same time, there is a decrease in the price of key goods, which we traditionally export <...> internal protests and confrontation between the authorities and key FPGS (financial-industrial groups. - Ed.),” the former parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, when the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
In such a situation, the leadership of Ukraine may make concessions on the Donbass, as a result of which there may be a conflict within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of the non-compliant with Zelensky groups of the population and the president, as a result of which it is possible to seize control over the power block and implement "populist initiatives".
In the case of such a crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is for Zelensky to become the "father of the nation."
This could happen as a result of some event that becomes a major shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to trigger a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine”, said Denisenko.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological disaster or aggressive actions by Russia, the former deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly denied any possibility of "attacking" Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from a survey by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts have forecast a situation in which, in the case of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the former president of the country, Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, support for the president was expressed by only 19.3% of those surveyed.

Thanks to the author for the story about the great athlete, I did not know that Elena Shushunova died, it is very sad to learn this.
I remember how I cheered for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, residents of Primorsky Krai, it was a live broadcast, real time.
There was so much passion, so much emotion, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They were also happy about the other victories, as they cheered for Salnikov, for the football players, for all the Soviet athletes back then.
On television, I saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries, and there they rolled the watermelons down the gangway of the ship, like barrels.
The watermelons were enormous.
I myself have worked many times in my youth picking and loading watermelons in Astrakhan Oblast and have never seen watermelons weighing more than a pound.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the vineyard and not before the beginning of August.
A balconette bra with soft cups (size: 90E, color: beige, composition: 90 % polyamide, 10 % elastane, art. no.: 12008).
A balconette bra with soft cups on boning.
The bottom of the cup is reinforced with a non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area where the straps are sewn, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated by the feston along the neckline and under the bust.
The vertical ribs on the side panels made of single-layer microfiber do not allow the fabric to roll up on large sizes.
I didn't like the article at all, it was nasty, poisonous.
Walked up to people you don't know.
But now it seems to be appealing to a lot of people, atomizing people.
I hope that the commentators with honor and decency will find their way and they are experts in everything.

Poet arrested for action on Red Square: "For a quote from Yevtushenko, 10 days are given, here is the power of poetry!"
Early in the week, twenty-one-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the HSE was detained on the Red Square with a placard on which was written the hashtag #poetofrussiaismoreimportantthanapoet.
This quote is attributed to the writer Evgeny Evtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander for repeated violation of the order of conducting a public event.
He was detained for the first time on 23 January on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, unfortunately, interest in it has been lost, as well as a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems online using this hashtag”, Alexander explains.
We spoke to the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and more fully unpack the message of his message.
How were you treated by police officers when you were detained this time and previously?
What did they ask in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the officers were more courteous, the arrest was as thorough as possible, and they were polite, even though it sounded somewhat comical in the context of that word.
At the Pushkin Square, the OMON guys took it hard.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When we heard about it, in principle, we looked at it if not approvingly, then understandingly.
Except for the wind-blown monkey cage, it was all above board, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if, after the action under this hashtag, at least a few people begin to write their poems, I will not have spent these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, talk to him alone, even in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
At public and official events, they speak the language of the surrounding people so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through a translator.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks fluent Russian and yet she uses a translator.
And at official events, stenography is still done by hand with a fountain pen, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.

Scientists explain how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals that help improve circulation and lower cholesterol.
The root vegetable contains vitamins of the B group, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the systems of the body to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high content of kelp, it is beneficial for the digestive tract, and can also help prevent high blood pressure and atherosclerosis when consumed regularly.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable is best boiled or steamed, rather than fried in oil.
Earlier, the publication The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other products with a high glycemic index.
These are products with carbohydrates that are quickly broken down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction in its production in private subsidiary farms and the increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current shortage can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex's search results
Candidates for elimination
In 2015, copyright holders from the "RAEK/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites in the Russian segment of the Internet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Karazyan, director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - have managed to survive thanks to regular changes of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Nectar" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest Russian video service Ivi (included in AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated newcomer Encanto, but, judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screening (a pirated copy of the film recorded in a cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "University. 10 years later" of the TNT channel (part of Gazprom-Media) is available.

Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient in that it has two different levels of firmness - high and slightly firmer.
The product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively in the best way.
Springs: The centre of the model features a block of "micro-pillow" independent springs.
This means that there are 2000 coils in the mattress, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives them a unique point-to-point adjustment.
The "micro package" is the most high-frequency of all the variety of spring blocks "Dimax", so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: Above and below the springs are combinations of layers of coir and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut fiber.
This combination of fillers has long been considered a classic, as it not only provides the mattress with orthopedic properties, but also with anatomical ones.
If the coir provides the correct support for the spine, then the latex provides the adaptation of the surface to the body of the person.
Cover: The model comes with Aloe Vera quilted cover.
It can be made either removable or permanent, depending on the client's wishes.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, and the recommended load on the sleeping surface is 170 kg.
Guarantee and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has all the necessary certificates and documents confirming its complete safety and reliability in use.
The foam used in the mattress is certified by CertiPUR.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the planet's atmosphere, Aktualne.cz reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions launching in five years is to assess the habitability of Venus' clouds, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools for measuring the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
Until now, it was thought that Venus' clouds, the closest planet to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was a terrestrial planet from the start.
A sample from Venus is expected to arrive during the third mission.
Let's assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth or different.
If very similar, then it will be obvious that life on Earth did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then it is more likely that life originated on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Mihkel Pajusalu.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of metaverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would be changing its name to Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, business in Russia, like in the rest of the world, will invest in the creation of its own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be seen as a continuation of the objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend of creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, because people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is the result of the business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
The third is that they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art, and even money go into a digital format.
Anna, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you don't want to eat anything too greasy or unhealthy.
Of course, we will have the traditional "Olivier" and "herring under the fur coat" for the holiday, but no one is forcing me to eat everything at once.
You can eat a spoonful, try it, and you're done.
After all, there are ten weekend days ahead, so you can prepare any tasty and healthy dishes.

British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022, as he believes that such attempts will end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and the second is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he didn't know whether the price rises were temporary or not.
As the expert noted, it was already clear before the pandemic that "the world of infinite generosity of central banks had run its course" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates, adjusted for inflation, would be correlated with expected rates of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that in the context of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-easy monetary policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty reduction and climate change, concluded O'Neill.
Earlier, the head of the global research department of "Otkritie Investments" Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, although the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin named the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices, and fears amid the coronavirus pandemic.
I'm forced to agree.
But one thing is good: if you compare yourself with yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.

There's another problem: there are a lot of environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on the purchase of new cars in the first 10 months of 2021, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI).
To put it into perspective, roughly the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In September last year, at a meeting of heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such a sum is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's GDP in 2020.
By sales on the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is in the lead.
Over the past 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 32.57 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
For the related Kia brand, Hyundai's growth is even greater - more than 35%, and revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
On the leading positions, this brand is also in terms of the increase in the average price of the car - in a year, Hyundai's price increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the dynamics of the price increase was even stronger than that of Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, the volume of sales of Korean brands did not increase so significantly: according to the statistics of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in quantitative terms over the same period last year.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in terms of money. Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on this brand's cars over the past 10 months, which is 14% more than a year ago.
Mercedes-Benz is in second place with 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both its sales volume (by 37%) and its average car price (almost by 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
“At the same time, Mercedes-Benz is experiencing good sales growth and an average price that is higher than that of BMW, which is why there is a greater increase in financial capacity, explained NAPi’s CEO Tatiana Arabadzhieva.
In terms of sales growth, fantastic figures are being shown by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year".
The Russian Lada, in terms of the dynamics of income growth, demonstrates average market indicators (plus 28%), and Russians have spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand over the past 10 months.
At the same level as last year in terms of financial capacity are companies whose car sales in units fell in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is even in the red - Russians spent 12 billion rubles on the manufacturer's off-road vehicles and pickup trucks over the past 10 months, down from 12.4 billion rubles a year ago.
Against the backdrop of component shortages and production disruptions affecting the entire global automotive industry, automakers continue to adjust prices - Lada, for example, has raised the price of its models seven times over the course of the year, with the most recent increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) taking place at the end of November.
Regularly, other car manufacturers also change the price tags on their products.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to grow - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation and the desire of car manufacturers to make up for past losses are contributing to this, experts say.
In the context of the shortage of cars, I think that many car manufacturers have even been able to partially pass on the costs of previous periods to the consumer, which they were not able to include in the price of the car in the past.
according to VTB Capital analyst Vladimir Bespalov.
I think the carmakers are feeling pretty good financially at the moment, with high margins on sales."
The indirect indicator of this is the pace of growth in the cost of cars, which is observed in 2021, the cost of new cars is growing faster than inflation, the expert notes.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and in terms of money, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the construction of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As supply increases, the ability to raise prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year even if the price growth slows down, car manufacturers will be able to get their profits thanks to the volume, says independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now trying to get the maximum profit from each sold car, Burkhaliev notes.
Production of machines is not expected to increase at least for the next six months, while in Russia the hype is being fuelled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
Against the background of the situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its initial cost, notes the expert.
Biden Says U.S. Would Send Troops to Ukraine in Case of Russian Invasion
U.S. officials have never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of a "Russian invasion."
Such a statement was made by the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
“There has never been such a plan,” the White House chief of staff said, responding to a reporter’s question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in case of escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the United States and NATO do not have an obligation to use military force to defend Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of the use of American troops in a unilateral manner for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will send forces to eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
“We’re going to have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 – all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to defend from any attack by Russia” – said Biden.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov emphasized that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of the drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."

If a fraudster calls from a similar number, such as a "police officer" or another law enforcement agency, it is ineffective to immediately hang up, and it is unlikely that you will have time to add the number to the blacklist.

Here's some bullshit...
I don't believe that at all.

And on the surface, I can even smile at you.

The film of Alexander Sokurov's pupil won the European "Oscar" for the best editing
Nominated for the "Oscar," the Russian film "Unclenching the Fist" received an award from the European Film Academy (also known as the "European "Oscar") in the category of "Best Editing," reports "Moscow Comsomolskaya Pravda."
The jury of the contest, voting online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, assessed the outstanding mastery of the filmmakers.
The most awards went to this year's film "Where Are You Going, Aida?" by Jasmila Žbanić (Bosnia).
The main character of the film is a UN translator who tries to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Clenching Fists," directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), this film tells the story of complicated relationships between a domineering father and children who want to break free from their father's guardianship in North Ossetia.
Earlier it was announced that this film was nominated for the "Oscar" as the best foreign language film.
As regular friendly meetings between the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey show, I think you're way off the mark.
