Students sing the main role at Zhejiang University Academic Conference; Research results make people's minds go wild - Xinhua News Agency
Use air to wash your hands, breathe out to diagnose diseases, and accurately search for the source of haze. At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University yesterday evening, a series of academic achievements with innovative ideas were awarded.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers environmental, mechanical, energy, medical, life science, humanities education, and other major fields. Students started from a point of curiosity and created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards in China and internationally.
Biological Sensors: Your Home Health Doctor
Zhang Dingmin, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-end biological sensor on the spot, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
“All you have to do is breathe lightly, and this device will be able to detect your health condition from the composition of the air you exhale. ”
According to Zhang Dingming, this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the smartphone after exhaling the gas.
Generally, the smart watches on the market can detect the physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biological sensor uses a new type of material, graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "nose" allows it to detect health conditions more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lights: Surgeons' High-Powered Eyes
Besides smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in operating rooms.
The invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, a master's student team from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, broke new ground in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the smart LED surgical no-shadows lamp.
“A lot of diseases are detected and removed late, and this is related to the light used in the operating room by doctors. ”
Shen Junfei said that, for example, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in the early stage of cancer detection, the cancer cells will still spread.
The smart surgical light has four panels, which can adjust the spectrum to enhance the difference between different tissues under the light.
During surgery, the doctor can adjust the size of the beam, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity and the shadow-free rate according to the surgical needs and personal habits at any time.
This smart surgical light has been used in Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Shao Yi Fei Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital and other hospitals, and received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Air washing: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by splashing water, at most rubbing some soap, squeezing some hand sanitizer, while Li Qichang and his classmates invented an "air hand washing device".
All you have to do is stand on the device's washbasin, and our weight will squeeze the air out.
“It’s like a balloon.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
This way, we can wash our hands clean! "
Color-changing reactions and bacterial residue tests prove that the effect of washing one's hands with this method is the same as that of a normal washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force to ensure cleanliness and save 90% of water. The whole process is completely pollution-free and energy-saving.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among the world's top universities and won the only gold award.

A certificate that feels very meaningful to me - First Aid
This is one of the skills certificates that I consider to be very important, apart from my driving licence!
Let's popularize this: emergency measures are actually emergency rescue measures, i.e. emergency rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is a period of time between the accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most crucial.
That's when you need emergency care.
If I really had a heart attack, a stroke, or stopped breathing, the window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So important to have people around you who know first aid!
When someone falls down in front of us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of standing there helplessly and doing nothing. This feeling of helplessness is too scary.
“In China, we have official data of 3 million people dying unexpectedly every year, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the national average is 15%.
In the casino hotels in Las Vegas, 78% can be rescued, Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%.
This is what the founder of the first reaction, Liu Le, said.
If someone has a cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, you can't do anything by squeezing their chest.
In order to save a person, it is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compression.
I found that we are still very few people will have this awareness to learn first aid, but when the thing happens, it is too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make a timely response when we face the emergency situation.
Maybe you can save a person's life!
First Aid Certificate can be enrolled in your local Red Cross Training Center, I enrolled in the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai, and students also have discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before I turn 25, and adding the first aid certificate to the list of goals was something I did a few months ago, but I did achieve it!
I'm going to take other certificates I want to take. I'm going to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is a diving emergency certificate. It seems that you have to have an emergency certificate before you can take the diving certificate. So the emergency certificate is also very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
And the 13-yen shrimp dumplings?
I haven't tried it.
How can #NAME# not be clear?
One for 13 yuan?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# sent the wrong meal, but this time it's just one shrimp dumpling for me to eat!?
Because it worked when I entered the code before
First of all, let's talk about the conclusion. In my opinion, "Four Seas" is a bad film from all aspects.
But you can't say that this movie isn't a highlight, either. The music, at least, is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, the kind that makes you fall asleep in the theater is one, the kind that makes you boil with rage when you leave is another. For the audience, "Four Sha" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in many different ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly a genius.
The most painful thing about this film is that it feels like a creature from a Kafkaesque nightmare, indescribable and full of holes.
Even after you've seen it, you'll wonder if there's a hidden allegory in there, but when you think about it, it's just a pile of shit.
First, let's briefly talk about some of the scenes that are hard for me to understand.
The protagonist's home should be a small island somewhere in the south, where he lives with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged that one of the old men in the neighborhood drove her to the northeast to see the snow.
Old people sitting in a bread truck from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his dad are very relaxed about it.
And that was the last we heard of the old man.
Opening a hotel on a derelict ship, how did the female lead's brother get a business license?
How did the little hoodlum on the island manage to block off a section of mountain road so easily?
Then the trucks carrying steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and the drivers of the trucks could not be found anywhere.
That's a bit too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a small-time criminal with a bad credit record and suspected of law-breaking become a traffic warden?
Why wouldn't you report high-interest loans? The police in the film even specifically asked if there were any problems?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open the door with a key card in a hotel, and then forcefully arranges to find the hotel owner, and spends the night sitting in front of the hotel room door?
This nonsensical plot pervades the entire film, so much so that when I think back on it, I feel pain.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about the film is its theme, or rather the lack of one: it's a grotesque Frankenstein's monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy, after 20 minutes, you will think that it may be a motivational film, and after watching half of it, you will think that it may be a story about the difficulties of young people in a small town, and after watching it, you will have no idea what kind of film you have watched, and you will have deep doubts about yourself, and you will wonder why you have to go to the cinema to watch shit.
For the most part, most people are actually quite familiar with the tropes of most genres of film. For example, if you want to make a motorcycle movie, it's going to be inspirational and comedic, and then you're going to tell the audience how a talented rookie goes from rags to riches.
If you want to make a romance film, then just tell the story of the love-hate relationship between the motorbike-loving town youth and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't contain things that contradict the normal world.
（For example, the character played by Yin Zheng, whose new motorcycle was just burned, but still sings well）, you can't open some brain holes that even Kennedys can't withstand.
As for the female protagonist, who is not an idiot but behaves like a 5-year-old child in some ways, I don't know whether it is the actor's acting skills or the director's requirements.
Another thing I don't understand is why, as a race car driver, Huan Huan is so passionate about adding crash scenes to his own films?
Would such a film be scheduled for the Spring Festival holiday just to give audiences a headache?

Chongqing pilot modern apprenticeship for junior secondary school students - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year onwards, 60 technical secondary schools in our city will carry out the “apprenticeship” talent training mode, and the students who are accepted for trial training will have the apprentice identity at the same time. After being enrolled, the students will be pre-recorded by the trial training enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission required that the admission and recruitment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and that the dual identity of apprentices, students of vocational schools, and trainees of enterprises be clarified. The apprentices, schools, and enterprises should sign a three-party agreement in accordance with the principle of mutual choice. For apprentices who are 16 years old but are less than 18 years old, the apprentices, guardians, schools, and enterprises should sign a four-party agreement to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific positions, teaching contents, rights protection, etc. of the apprentices during on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to carry out on-the-job training and transitional training for enterprise employees.
Pilot schools should reform their talent training mode.
To jointly design the talent training plan with enterprises, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, master standards of enterprise tutors, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot is based on the training period of one pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the top-job internship is generally 6 months.
In practice, enterprises should implement the enterprise workshop management mode. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group, so as to ensure that students can master the skills required by each rotation training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will set up 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot project having 50 students (apprentices), and a total of 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of piloting first and then expanding, and from point to surface, step-by-step implementation, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism of school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated cultivation, to effectively improve students’ job skills and improve students’ employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Omicron is highly contagious but mostly mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Limpopo province reported that the patients they are currently treating for COVID-19 are showing relatively mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The group's chief medical officer, Unben Pillay, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none have required hospitalization.
Pile said, "They are able to control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation. "
He said this includes the elderly and those with health problems, who are more likely to become seriously ill from a coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous Delta wave, the new coronavirus patients he treated "were struggling to breathe and had low oxygen levels.
Many people will be in hospital within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to gather enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa: among the patients who were hospitalized in the past few weeks due to COVID-19, only 30% were severe cases, which is only half of the severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of the patients died, while in the early epidemic in South Africa, the death rate was 20%.
The head of the Africa Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, citing data from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "So far, all indications are that this is a relatively mild disease. "
He also said: "It's still early days, we need to get later data.
Typically, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we entered this wave of the pandemic only two weeks ago.
At the same time, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the most prevalent coronavirus variant worldwide, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December increased by 400%, with tests showing that 90% of the cases were of the omicron variant.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education commentary: How to save kidnapped children?
If the famous public welfare advertisement comparing "no buying and selling, no killing" is compared, in the good environment without "rescue" needs, group prevention and group treatment, and all-round anti-trafficking, making the trafficking behavior unprofitable, risky, and high-cost, this kind of crime will not occur frequently.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security launched the emergency release platform for children missing information developed by the Anti-kidnapping Office of the Ministry of Public Security.
This is an official channel for the publication of child abduction information and the timely recovery of abducted children.
Hearing that the app is called "Reunion", I felt warm all over.
The new technological means are not only called "artistic" and sentimental, but also informationized, practical and effective.
Abduction law enforcement, the first priority is to recover the abducted children, to protect their personal safety and freedom.
Then comes the trial and punishment of the accused.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be enumerated with many "big words".
However, before the trafficking case is solved, the safety of the victim should be prioritized.
The matter is urgent or not, under the urgent "rescue" purpose, topics such as "whether kidnapping children should be subject to the death penalty" and other controversial topics can be postponed for the time being, and cautiously discussed; but the rescue of kidnapped children cannot be delayed.
According to the experience of handling such cases, human traffickers are prone to leave the scene as soon as they get their hands on the victims.
For every minute that the search for a missing child is delayed, the child may move further away from their parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one minute.
In this situation, the use of effective means such as the "reunion" platform to directly help solve cases and find children is indeed a realistic action.
After all, "rescuing" is a big task that requires the whole legal system to operate.
The protection of children and parents' rights, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of justice, and the strict enforcement of the law, all need to be carried out in accordance with the concern of "protecting the young and caring for the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at a train station, the parents are sleeping, and when they wake up, they realize that the child is missing.
You cannot expect a two-year-old to have enough self-protective skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have some protective instincts.
Both parents taking turns to rest, or putting the child in a safe place, are at least the most basic measures to prevent children from being kidnapped.
From the other side of the police crackdown on child trafficking, the buying side of the child trafficking should also be paid attention to and punished.
Individual acts of wrongdoing are often just one link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the minimum punishment for trafficking in children is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty may be imposed and the perpetrator's property may be confiscated.
The crime of trafficking in children is obviously a crime with a heavier punishment in the trend of "light punishment".
Even to this day, there are still many cases of trafficking that occur each year.
It can be seen that some people are backward in the concept of raising children, and their legal awareness is shallow.
The legal education of this part of the population should keep pace.
In order to effectively control trafficking crimes, relying solely on official strict law enforcement is not enough.
If the "market" for trafficking is widespread, the traffickers will be greedy for money, constantly innovate trafficking methods, and form a "fighting" situation with law enforcement. Anti-trafficking actions will inevitably fall into a low-efficiency quagmire.
Therefore, the elimination of backward ideas, the popularization of legal knowledge also helps to eradicate the trafficking and purchase of child criminals.

Waiting for a few hours
The International Olive Council classifies extra virgin olive oil and refined olive oil into five grades.
Pure olive oil, also known as extra virgin olive oil, is obtained directly from freshly harvested olives by mechanical cold pressing, filtration and other treatments to remove impurities.
According to the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and the highest quality of olive oil. It is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate floral aroma and acidity below 1%.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: Has a slightly higher acidity, but no more than 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO): Flavor and aroma are good, acidity is less than 0.8%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained by refining olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain percentage of extra virgin olive oil to balance the flavor and color, with acidity below 1.5%.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Refined olive-pomace oil is obtained by extracting olive oil from olive pomace through solvent extraction and refining.
If you've read up on olive oil grades, you'll know that acidity is a very important indicator.
In other words, olives are like grapes in that they come from different regions, different olive varieties, and produce different standards of olive oil.
Olive Oil's Best Growing Regions:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for growing olive oil, such as soil, temperature, sunshine, air humidity and rainfall.
Outside the coast of the Mediterranean, it can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and many others with similar climates, such as Argentina and Peru in the Southern Hemisphere.
Olive harvest month:
From 3 to 6 June each year is the flowering and fruiting period of the olive tree, and from 7 to 10 October the fruits begin to develop and mature, changing from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to the following February is the harvest season (freshness of olive oil is very important, you know).
The nutritional value of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in a variety of monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is believed to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition of all the oils discovered to date.
Democratic Convention Ends, Biden Says Freedom's Flame Will Never Go Out
The online "Democracy Summit" (Summit for Democracy) hosted by U.S. President Biden on Friday (December 10) ended with the participation of government leaders and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world.
Biden said in his closing remarks that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of people around the world, and dictatorships will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan's representative to the United Nations, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Fei, and the Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist currently in exile in the United Kingdom, Lo Kin-chung, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know the work ahead is daunting.
But we also know that we can meet these challenges, because as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
An authoritarian regime can never extinguish the small flame of freedom. It burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world. ”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the efforts of the entire society.
He said, "As the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, and achieve transparent supervision and governance, so as to better resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism and those who seek power at the expense of the public interest. "
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and resisting digital authoritarianism, as well as affirming the value of democracy.
It was International Human Rights Day.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, also said in his opening speech on that day that democracy is facing challenges all over the world, especially the challenges brought by new digital technologies.
He said: "It's time to reaffirm our common values and positions, and our democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, updating the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Kin-chong delivered a pre-recorded video message to the conference, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities, such as the Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: "The world has long benefited from China's rise, but there has been no mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the restoration of democracy is our top priority.
Roger Wong also called on the free world to unite against the threat posed by the CCP.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending President Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
This is also why we need to change.
Tang Fei, Executive Secretary of the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan), delivered a video speech at the roundtable discussion of "Countering Digital Dictatorship, Affirming Democratic Values" and made a "National Statement" emphasizing that Taiwan is standing on the front line of resisting autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared the experience of how to fight against the new coronavirus epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly on the front line of the global struggle against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
Under the pretext of public health and collective interest, authoritarian governments around the world have justified the violation of human rights during the pandemic, and democracy is regressing globally.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without a lockdown, and we can defeat false information without shutting down. "
At the same time as the agenda for the "Democracy Summit" was underway, the United States Department of the Treasury announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries that have been determined to have committed serious human rights violations, and also impose investment restrictions on a Chinese company that has been determined to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I've already taken pictures and uploaded them to you guys.
I know.
However, the restaurant did not know why the delivery time was repeatedly postponed.
It was supposed to be #NUMBER#
Anyway, I didn't call
I ate
I will definitely complain.
You can't deliver it, so why didn't you say it earlier?
I've been waiting for you for so long
No, I did not receive a call
Please notify him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait any more #NUMBER# minutes.
An hour and a half for a meal
#PRS_ORG# have not been delivered
I want to cancel the order
Why not cancel?
Hello, the chicken sent by the restaurant is alive
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a coach with a similar price.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can not distinguish, the expensive normal will be more friendly than the cheap drum, this kind of "entry drum" is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, and the hard ball cannot withstand it. High-level players find it difficult to control.
Their logic and subtext is - tennis is so hard, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to spend a lot of money, so we'll give you a cheap one, and you'll play with it for a couple of times, and then you won't play tennis anymore, so this racket is cheap, and you won't feel bad about it.
When you can tell the difference between good and bad, that means you've made progress. Then come back here and buy the expensive ones. I'll make two times the money.
Buy a similar-priced second-hand racket, choose Prince or Dunlop, these brands are not well-known, so good rackets are not expensive, a new racket costs 500 or 600 yuan, and a second-hand racket costs 200 yuan, don't you enjoy a thousand-yuan racket?
Friendly to beginners, but useless after the beginner stage, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the beginner stage.
Orders have been repeatedly delayed for delivery
Could you follow up on this, please?
Delay
Thank you
In other words, I already have credit?
Do I need to re-order now? Wasn't the original order cancelled?

In fact, there are many requirements for dressing and matching for girls who are a little plump.
Girls who are overweight should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be just above the knee, covering the fat on the thighs.
A skirt that is too short will reveal the fat on your legs.
If it's too long, it will give the impression of being short and fat.
If you wear it from top to bottom in three sections, it will make you look taller. Just use different colors for the top, skirt, and long socks, and it will give the impression of a slender figure.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for plump girls, and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. Black short skirts are also the first choice of plump girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially a short black skirt, will make you look slimmer.
If your thighs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeably.
The more popular it is, the better, and the colors shouldn't be too bright.
Avoid making your legs and feet look fat by not drawing attention to them when people are looking at you.
For girls who are slightly chubby, it is necessary to talk about the dressing and matching skills.
Don't wear tight short skirts if you're a pear-shaped girl, and don't wear clothes that are too short or stuffed into the skirt, which will make people feel uncomfortable. If you have fat legs, wear black long socks or mesh socks (the kind with small holes, that is), choose a printed flared skirt with a soft fabric, and wear a shirt with a ruffled collar, which can hide the shortcomings of a pear-shaped girl.
Of course, there are also some rules for short skirts for chubby girls.
Wearing a short skirt, you should choose a shirt that matches the color of the short skirt, which will make you look taller.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the hottest look of the summer!
If you're a top-heavy girl with skinny legs, go for a glamorous short dress.
Not only can it hide a big belly, but it can also highlight your advantages.
A-line short skirts will make you look slimmer, which is more suitable for fat girls. Choose a tighter shirt to create a sense of layering, which will make you look slimmer.
Wearing a simple white T-shirt with a short skirt, even fat girls can try it.
Plus-sized girls can also be stylish.
As long as you can master the principle of dressing and matching, thin girls will also become the focus of attention.
In terms of dressing, there has been a change, and in life, you also need to exercise more, so that you can get rid of the label of being a chubby girl as soon as possible 😄

Girl, 12, used as target for archery fundraiser for sister: 'It hurt, but it was worth it' - South China Morning Post
A girl was standing in front of a large wooden board at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "human targets, 10 yuan per shot" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'target' to raise money for her sister" went viral on WeChat.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The wooden board has the words "human targets, 10 yuan per shot" written on it, indicating that passers-by can shoot people with bows and arrows after paying.
The behavior triggered heated discussions among netizens.
Yesterday evening, the Publicity Department of Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau Xiacheng Branch confirmed to the reporter of Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl was the sister who raised funds, but this kind of behavior is not worthy of advocacy. After being admonished, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl, 10, hit by arrows on street in fundraising stunt
The picture circulated online shows a long-haired girl standing in the shape of the character "qi" in front of a large wooden board with the words "human target, 10 yuan per shot" written in black ink. The wooden board in front of her has her bank account number and WeChat, Alipay and other account numbers written on it.
The image caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens thought this was "begging for attention," and there were also many netizens who expressed sympathy.
“We discovered the situation around 10:00 a.m. on the morning of the 23rd when we were patrolling around the square. At that time, there were already a lot of onlookers. ”
According to the reporters of the local media, the police officers of the Tianshui Police Station near the scene said that there were two young girls selling goods, both of whom were in their 20s. They were dressed in a fashionable way.
Among them, the girl who was made to be a "human target" was crying and begging passers-by to play the game; another girl was standing on the side, shouting that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery.
“We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was fundraising for her sister’s leukemia treatment. ”
Last night, the publicity officer of Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau Xiacheng Branch told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali, and she was collecting money for her sister Ji Jiaying.
However, due to the treatment cost of more than 300,000 yuan, he could not think of a good way to raise funds, so he did this.
He said that during the process, the two girls, one was the target and the other was the shooter, but they did not participate in it. During the process, no one shot arrows, but there were people watching and taking pictures and uploading them to Weibo.
After police examination by the security department, the bow and arrows used were not within the scope of control.
The official said, "We do not advocate this kind of attention-grabbing fundraising."
After being warned by the police, she has left the police station.

What was hot in 2021?
Without a doubt, the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there was an article called "Look! Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals in the Olympic Games" that was very popular. The article mentioned that project managers can be the first in many projects, and no one can compete with them: moving bricks, traveling, staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, and firefighting, taking the blame, and apologizing are not uncommon.
An article that seems to be a joke, but also expresses the daily hardships of project managers, and represents a lack of enthusiasm for the current project management work.
And those who work in project management are also gradually choosing to take some action to get out of the predicament they find themselves in at work.
From the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional) certification candidates each year, it can be seen that more and more project managers are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management 20-Year Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants in China was nearly 600,000, and the number of people who passed the PMP® exam was about 420,000, and the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® holders.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified people has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that: it is no longer possible to rely on the old "experience" to do things, and the ever-changing working environment makes us know that we need to learn, and stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does passing the PMP guarantee that project management work will run smoothly?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major domains and five major process groups of project management, but they still don't know what to do when they actually do project management work.
Many project managers often report the following problems: 1. Lack of project management awareness, relying solely on personal experience; 2. Lack of a systematic project management process; 3. Unable to implement project management in practice; 4. Inaccurate project estimation; 5. Inadequate control sensitivity; 6. Delays in project progress; 7. The “old oil” in the team does not know how to deal with it; 8. Cross-departmental cooperation is not smooth; 9. It is difficult to advance the project ……
Therefore, after focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, he has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key talents, and has won the honorary titles of "China's Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Base" and "China's Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Base". The "Research and Development Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course of Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has come.

JD.com urges consumers to practice rational consumption on the eve of "Double 12" - Economic Observer
This year's "Double 11" carnival, the total amount of national network payment business transactions reached 177 billion yuan, which is higher than that in previous years.
The variety of discount coupons and the eye-catching live broadcasts of shopping have once again attracted the attention of consumers, and this wave of consumer enthusiasm has both made people marvel at the strength of the national consumer, and also made them reflect on the influence of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer group.
On the eve of "Double 12", Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding young users in particular to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to resist blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
In general, the performance of Chinese residents in financial consumption is good, but there are great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and the basic financial knowledge level needs to be further improved.
The financial literacy of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "the elderly and the young" will continue to be the focus of continuous attention of financial education; Nielsen's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" and CCTV-2's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the young generation has a huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important channel for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people use credit products, and nearly half of them do not have debt accumulation. Although the young generation as a whole presents a rational consumption trend, it is quite different from the "over-consumption" tag given by the outside world, but some young people do have over-consumption and follow-the-trend consumption behavior, and because of this, they have caused a large financial burden and debt risk, and even caused social problems to increase, and financial institutions should have the courage to assume social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always been committed to providing high-quality and considerate services to help the people build their own happy life, advocate the correct and positive consumption attitude of consumers, and actively respond to the call of supervision, and improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young consumers.
Over the past years, Jiexin has launched a series of comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including university students, and has guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as cooperation with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions, so as to help them establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan their consumption needs, and thus help them accumulate wealth in their lives.
On the eve of Double 12, Jiexin reminded all consumers friends to establish a reasonable consumption concept and a correct money concept, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid the trap of consumption borrowing, so as to avoid affecting personal credit and economic life in the future.
Consumers must plan in advance and repay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life in the future, such as buying a car and buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions are qualified to operate.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to rely on its mature, reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated financial products to provide consumers with services that are more in line with their needs and more diversified. Jiexin will continue to help the general public improve their financial knowledge and help consumers develop a rational consumption habit and a moderate borrowing concept. Jiexin will be a consumer finance partner that consumers can rely on for life.

Vietnam People's Army - Gulf Cooperation Council to Cope with Common Challenges
Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Noteworthy is that this is the first visit by Mohammed bin Salman to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in the middle of 2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a full embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tension has had a serious impact on the internal cohesion of the organization, and has had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the January 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council summit, where all Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move toward "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
The Gulf Arab states have resolved their differences to restore relations with Qatar in response to the need to unite for common interests and regional stability in the face of common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land corridor between two neighboring countries in the Arabian Gulf.
The 725-kilometer long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the citizens of the two countries to travel and integrate supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and 13 agreements worth $30 billion were signed between the two countries' companies.
The Saudi Deputy Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear deal between Iran and the world's major powers that the Gulf Arab states have criticized for not being able to solve the issue of Iranian missiles.
The Gulf states have always viewed Iran as a long-term "rival" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to the region's security.
All the Gulf countries believe that if the missile issue is not resolved, and action is not taken to curb Iran's activities in the region, it is deficient.
In the background of the fact that the nuclear talks between major countries and Iran did not meet the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct talks.
Its aim is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that contribute to the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first since some member states ended their dispute with Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the Gulf Cooperation Council's unity, while proposing measures to ensure full cooperation among its member states to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of Gulf countries.

Claims to be the loudest supercar exhaust in Bukit Timah!
This time, our team brought this car to you, which is the dream of many men!
It's the flagship supercar from Lamborghini, the replacement for the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
A price tag of nearly RM200,000, road tax of RM11,000 a year, four-wheel drive, why is it called the LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, how fast do you think it is?
Well, I don't know either. The acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h is only 2.9 seconds, which is probably faster than my myvi, which takes 30 km/h to reach 100 km/h.
The low-slung body, the aggressive scissor doors, the huge air intakes all over the body, and the 6.5-litre V12 engine under the glass, perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini.
For the explanation of the car, it is not necessary to say too much, just Google it yourself, and the editor has summarized some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention, wherever you go, everyone is looking at you, it's uncomfortable! (It's actually fun)
1km of petrol costs around RM1 (the car owners don't care at all)
Practice getting in and out of the car, it's a little embarrassing (because you can't get out of the car and it gets stuck halfway)
The engine noise is so loud that you go deaf as soon as you get out of the car. (But it's still fun)
The car is too big to park in a normal parking space, and I'm afraid of being hit by the car next to me when it opens the door!
A bit lonely, because there are no competitors on the road (I said it myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, ha ha)
Please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, I'm sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for their cars are welcome to contact us!
More car information you don't know, just in The Car Guide / People's Car Guide
Involved in an accident worth millions of yuan!
The Bugatti Chiron and the Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. The Chiron is one of the world's most expensive supercars, and the Porsche 911's price is also in the million-dollar range!
The day before, foreigners crashed the 10 million Porsche 911 and the 100 million supercar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the result, it is reasonable to be noble!
Let university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a set of academic concepts and value pursuits accumulated by a university over a long period of time, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the university spirit has been of great importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the first modern university in the world, universities have borne a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they were born in the autumn of the nation's crisis, and their spirit has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. They advocate the value concept of "cultivating virtue and benefiting the world" and "strengthening the country through education".
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the global competition of education, technology and talents is becoming more and more intense. Higher education, as an important "supply side" of education, is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the release of the "Comprehensive Plan for the Coordinated Development of World-Class Universities and World-Class Disciplines" has not only demonstrated China's confidence and determination to advance from a higher education superpower to a higher education powerhouse, but has also put forward higher requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to join the ranks of world-class universities in a short period of time, and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines, so as to achieve "overtaking in the curve "?
Besides target self-confidence, path self-confidence and ability self-confidence, universities should also fully play three advantages: one is the advantage of being a latecomer. By continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas, learning and borrowing the advanced experience of world-class universities, the academic level and quality of education can be significantly improved; two is the advantage of culture. By inheriting the wisdom accumulated in the five thousand years of Chinese civilization, and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, it can unite the power, shape the brand, and enhance the image; three is the advantage of the system. By playing the superiority of socialism with Chinese characteristics, focusing on the goal, gathering consensus, optimizing resource allocation, it can provide a solid and sustainable guarantee for the university to catch up with the advanced level of the world.
It is important to realize that building world-class universities is not a one-size-fits-all model, and each university must have its own characteristics and characteristics.
Academic characteristics should have both the common characteristics of Chinese characteristics and the unique characteristics of target positioning, educational traditions and resource endowment.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we will focus on three aspects of characteristics in our education: one is to emphasize the cultivation of innovation and entrepreneurship talents, build an integrated environment for education and industry integration, and form a whole chain of entrepreneurial education ecological system; the second is to emphasize the cultivation of interdisciplinary congregation, optimize and adjust the academic system, promote the establishment of an interdisciplinary environment, and vigorously cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; and the third is to emphasize the cultivation of the education system and social services, deepen international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a comprehensive Zhejiang University-industry-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the “Seeking Truth from Facts” motto, the “Diligence, Integrity, Inquiry, and Perseverance” common value system, and the “Embracing the River and the Sea, Cultivating True Virtue, Opening the Way for the People, and Establishing Our Country” common expression system constitute the latest expression system of Zhejiang University’s spirit.
It is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct educational direction and continuously accumulate the cultural height and condense the spiritual power. The content is rich and the significance is profound.
Among them, "Hainanjianghe" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, which reflects the spirit of "the world's talents are used by me" and is embodied in the adoption of the excellent educational ideas of world-class schools; "Qizhuchunde" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and pursuing goodness, which means that universities should not only pursue the truth, but also receive the cultivation of morality and the tempering of personality; "Qiwumianmin" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of new knowledge, the creation of innovation in scientific research, and the reform and innovation of the country; "Shouwugongguo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always be in harmony with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
“A wise man hears without listening, and a man of understanding sees without looking.”
In order to further focus on the overall situation of socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, deeply understand the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhering to the humanistic care and the spirit of independence, making the university spirit and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation and the spirit of humanity mutually stimulate each other, so as to provide an endless power for the realization of the national prosperity and the revitalization of the Chinese nation and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

When I saw the news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling was the choice of enterprises on the track. That is to say, the choice of investment targets in the industry. First of all, it is necessary to choose an industry with a large growth space of more than 100 billion yuan; secondly, it is necessary to choose an industry with good growth in the future; and finally, it is necessary to choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and the track is flat or uneven refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 and adjust the 2022 strategic layout.
The strategy is to "do the right things," which means doing things right.
And the strategy is "do the right thing," which is doing the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the tactics are to implement it. In most of the tactical thinking, there is a space for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (strategic thinking) above, you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend horizontally (strategic thinking); how to improve the retention rate of customers (tactical thinking) above, you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); how to improve the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking) above, you can think about how to set the correct KPI of activities, achieve the correct goal of activities, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and precision recruitment; how to increase DAU (tactical thinking) above, you can think about whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

The seller's service attitude is also very enthusiastic.
This time, not only did I enjoy the scenery, but I also took beautiful wedding photos, and I also made a friend, the photographer.
The wedding photos are too good, blowing up the photographer and makeup artist, you guys are super super professional.
I am very grateful to Ms. Mu for patiently accompanying and carefully teaching me, and I like the photos I took.

The most important thing in taking wedding photos is that the photographer and the makeup artist are aesthetically in line. Fortunately, I met them.
After seeing my wedding photos, I realized that I was also "photobombing."
Asian American Group Sues Harvard, Other Ivy League Schools Over Admissions - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian American organizations in the United States submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23 to protest against the discrimination against Asian American applicants in the admission process of three Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Education Alliance, which filed the complaint, held a news conference in Washington on the same day.
According to Zhao Yuxiang, the chairman of the group, in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top universities has increased exponentially, but the proportion of Asians in these three American top universities has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities engage in a "holistic" admissions process that "systematically discriminates against Asian-American applicants."
Zhao Yuxiang said that in 2014, Sanders and other scholars found that among these three universities, the relative number of applicants and the admission rate of Asians were the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among the Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest percentage of Asian students admitted, and Yale University and Brown University have practiced de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuxuan told Xinhua News Agency reporter that they hope that after filing the appeal, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in their recruitment.
They also hope that the colleges that are being sued will proactively address this issue and change their admissions policies to be more inclusive of Asians.
So far, the three universities that have been complained about have not made a response.
The Asian American Coalition for Education was founded in 2015, when it filed a complaint against Harvard University for alleged discrimination in its admissions process, but the U.S. Department of Education declined to investigate on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups, this time, the Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American education groups also participated in the appeal.

In September 2020, Mr. Li learned from a real estate agency that a factory in Yuezhong Town, Yueqing City, Zhejiang Province was for sale. After visiting the site several times, Mr. Li decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Liu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory with the family members of the owner of the property, Lin Xiang, and transferred 200,000 yuan via bank transfer as a deposit on the same day.
Lin signed the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt" as the payee, which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller within one week after signing the factory purchase and sale contract."
However, after the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, the house purchase contract was delayed for a long time.
Considering that the two parties could not reach an agreement on the terms of the contract, a few days later, Lin Xiang returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Liu Xian.
After paying the deposit and preparing the house price, he was just one step away from signing the contract, but the seller changed his mind and refused to sell the house, which made Mr. Li helpless and angry.
As a result, Mr. Liu sued Ms. Lin to Yueyang City People's Court.
The court judged that after negotiations, the parties did not sign a formal contract, and the defendant could not solely blame the plaintiff. It is reasonable to assume that the negotiation was unsuccessful, so the case should not apply the penalty for deposit. The defendant does not need to bear the double return of deposit liability for breach of contract.
After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the second instance court upheld the original verdict.
【Legal Advice】 In the course of a transaction, you must exercise due diligence.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, it is necessary to perform due diligence obligations, such as verifying the ownership information of the property, whether the property is occupied by others, etc., and clearly stipulate the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes when performing the contract.
China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" after the end of the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, which was "to use ideology to draw a line, to turn democracy into a tool, a weapon, to use the name of democracy to do the opposite of democracy, to incite division and confrontation, and to divert domestic contradictions."
According to the Chinese government, "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, carried out "democratic reform", imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions", and caused catastrophic consequences.
Democracy has long been the United States' "weapon of mass destruction" when it comes to interfering in other countries.
The summit was an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was held virtually, with leaders from 111 countries invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There have also been concerns internationally and in the United States, including criticism of the invitees, which included some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who have questioned whether the Biden administration's true intention was to promote democracy or to pursue geopolitical interests in organizing the summit.
German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American style of democracy is in full display, with money politics, identity politics, party polarization, political polarization, social division, racial tensions, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor. " The American style of democracy is based on capital and is a "game for the rich."
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, drive reform, and achieve transparent accountability management, and be able to resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who seek power at the expense of the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not a given, "We have to renew it in every generation, and in my view, that is the defining challenge of our time. "
Biden also said that "democracy and human rights around the world are facing persistent and troubling challenges, and democracy needs champions to defend it."
The United States pledged to launch a year-long effort after the summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States wants all countries to make specific, public commitments before the planned 2022 end-of-year in-person democracy summit to improve their democratic systems.
Mr. Biden said, "Let's make sure that all countries fulfill their commitments and report back to us on their progress next year."

Educational Thoughts: How University Exams Make "Geniuses" and "Dummies" Get What They Deserve - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about the university examinations, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examinations, change the examination types, and let the examinations truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
In a university campus, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and different levels of learning.
It is inevitable that there will be different perceptions when assessing such a diverse group.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type and the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause a different feeling.
Students who don't put in the effort may be able to pass by cramming just before the test, but if they want to go the extra mile, they may be able to get twice the results with half the effort.
As a result, "academic slackers" who do not put in the effort can pass with flying colors, and even get high grades; "academic superstars" who never miss a class, have good homework and notes, and get high grades on tests.
Thus, it can be seen that the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University who reported the problems in the university entrance examination were not without reason. It is believed that this kind of situation also exists in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this point of view, we should applaud the three students who wrote letters of complaint.
In fact, those who have graduated from university are well aware that cramming for exams, trying all sorts of ways to "steal" exam questions from teachers, and trying to get exam questions within the scope of the exam are not uncommon, and even in the exam, there are cases of carrying small notes and asking teachers to raise their hands after the exam.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment direction, measuring whether a university exam is qualified or not is more related to the comprehensive understanding of teachers on teaching and learning, as well as the scientific setting of the exam.
Entering the undergraduate stage of university, the specialty begins to subdivide, and many of the specialty courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether to master the basic knowledge points of a discipline is one of the contents of university examinations.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic knowledge of the discipline, from the perspective of knowledge points, there is not much change, it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "20 years ago, the basic knowledge of university mathematics was learned, and now it is still being learned, and it is still the focus.
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are monotonous and repeated.
In many universities, exams are generally made up of examination committees, which are then overseen by senior teachers in the subject. The marking of the exams is also done by all the teachers in charge of the subject, to a certain extent reducing the possibility of the same questions being asked in different exams.
However, in order to devise a set of examination questions that are suitable for both teaching and learning, the difficulty of the questions should be distributed in a normal distribution according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the situation of teaching and learning, and fully analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the examination questions can dynamically grasp the difficulty and type of questions according to the difficulty and type of questions, and at the same time pay attention to the examination of the basic knowledge, and also pay attention to the examination of the ability, and at the same time innovate the type of questions.
Examinations are the baton of university education. With what kind of examinations, students will have corresponding preparation plans. If this continues, it will affect the effect of university education.
For the suggestion letters for students, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Require each teaching unit to organize teachers to carry out discussions and course final exam comparative self-checks, draft examination papers and relevant regulations, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination paper drafting and reviewing and approving stages, fine-tune the assessment of scores, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all stages of course teaching.
Solving the problem of single-type test questions and repeated questions is a major issue that university examinations need to face, of course, there should be corresponding regulations, but the key lies in the daily routine. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only to digest the teaching content, but also to digest the learning situation of students. Both ends should be digested, and the teaching and learning interaction will be better, and the test will be more in line with the actual situation, so that "academic stars" and "academic dregs" will get what they deserve.

Golden Lady Wedding Photography (South Street branch) is temporarily without a branch
Before taking photos, we changed the time twice because of our time was not arranged well. Lan Lan, the consultant, was very patient to help us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a sunny weekend to shoot it.
Mrs. Gold's staff, whether consultants, make-up artists or photographers, are all fantastic.
That was the first time I ever did my makeup properly, wow, I can't believe I'll ever look that good one day, haha.
Xiao Qi and the other girl (sorry, I don't remember her name) did a great job with makeup, and the makeup was very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Jingwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, so I didn't feel cold. During the shooting, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and accessories from time to time. If there was anything wrong, he would immediately help us fix it.
The photographer was also very funny, and after a day of taking pictures, he felt very happy.
During the selection of photos, because we saw a lot of cases on the Internet, we didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we selected photos, we didn't have any intention to add photos, and we directly selected the 24 photos in the package (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos at the same time as me, spent more than 7,000 yuan for the package and added more than 10,000 yuan of photos. I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many photos).
Today, the photos were fixed, Lan Lan sent them to me, and I felt that there were two photos that were not very good, they immediately helped me to fix them.
I took out my sister's photos and compared them with ours, and I was really satisfied with our photos. They were simple and fresh, which was exactly what I wanted.
I really recommend everyone to go to Xianhua to take wedding photos!
Set price: 3,999 yuan
Mrs. Jin thanks you for your sincere blessings and wishes that you will be happy and prosperous in the future!
How much does this set cost?
What conditions must be met for $32 to be used?
That's fine, I don't need a refund.

More than 3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to shortage of anti-forgery paper
(Sarawak, 11/10) The Sarawak Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages said that due to the depletion of the special anti-forgery paper, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October, with a total of 3,200 people affected.
However, the head of the office, Kailu Aminu, assured that all babies who had applied for birth certificates had their information recorded in the system and that the certificates would be reissued once the anti-forgery papers arrive next week.
He made a clarification at a press conference in response to a 10-month-old report by an online media on the issue of the printing of newspapers in Sabah.
He said the issue had surfaced two months ago, and Sarawak was also facing the same problem.
“One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory that produces special anti-counterfeiting paper is affected by the epidemic, and it will be delayed to arrive in China. ”
He explained that the Sabah newspapers use different anti-counterfeit papers compared to other states, so they cannot borrow stocks from other states.
Kelu Aminu revealed that the latest batch of anti-forgery papers arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6, and were handed over to the printing company on June 8 for part of the printing work.
“The agency will send a person to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and bring them back to Sabah for the final printing. It is estimated that it will take 2 more working days (December 20th) to deliver the application to the applicant. ”
“We will notify the applicants to go to the local bureaus to pick up the admission papers. ”
He added that a total of 24,801 birth certificates have been issued in Sabah so far this year.
I've been waiting since 7:30
Isn't it about time?

Within 48 hours of a negative nucleic acid test, set up a "buffer zone" and strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities at the national joint prevention and control mechanism - Xinhuanet
XINHUANET.com All Rights Reserved.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port cities in each province, autonomous region, and municipality, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that under certain conditions, border cities can study the establishment of epidemic prevention buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some border cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar, and frequent cross-border exchanges between the two sides.
Implementing differentiated management policies according to regions, from one line of defense to two lines of defense, is expected to move the control line forward, compress the risk of spreading the epidemic, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, several local outbreaks of clustered epidemics have occurred in China, and all of them were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some places' epidemic monitoring and early warning were not timely, high-risk front-line personnel's closed-loop management was not implemented, regular nucleic acid testing was only formalities, cold chain products' various links were not disinfected well, epidemic emergency response was not scientific and accurate, etc.
The notice requires that from strengthening the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of border cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and other 9 aspects, efforts should be made to fill in the shortcomings and weak links of epidemic prevention and control in border cities, and the epidemic prevention and control work should be carried out scientifically and accurately without slack.
The notice stressed that each port city should coordinate the prevention and control of epidemics with the work of ensuring the livelihood of the people, publish and open up the hotline for the livelihood protection, and regularly check the supply of basic living necessities, prices, etc., and timely solve and proactively respond to the prominent problems raised by the public.
According to the notice, the cities included in the ports include the counties (cities, districts, autonomous prefectures) where the land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the cities (provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities) and the direct-controlled municipalities. The specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, and municipality) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control, and is announced in time.

YouTube video exposes US military's 20-year bloodthirsty killing spree - Xinhuanet
(video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro documentary called "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States launched a war in Afghanistan under the guise of "anti-terrorism" to forcefully export American-style democracy, 20 years of poverty, bloodthirstiness, and killing the innocent, and committed various crimes against humanity.
Misusing drones to bomb hospitals, schools, and other civilian sites, twisting human nature, and establishing a killing squad.
Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up "black sites" where "suspects" were subjected to various forms of torture and humiliation.
One atrocity after another has stoked more Afghans' hatred.
As the video says, the "anti-terror" war in the United States is becoming more and more "terror".
War has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity and hope to the Afghan people. It has only brought devastation and destruction.
Punch the video, let's expose the truth of the United States under the guise of "anti-terrorism" and bloodthirsty killings, and expose the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article from a commercial perspective and from the perspective of the storage period, why this customer wants to entrust the logistics company in the bonded zone to do canning, although canning is deep processing, it is not within the scope of operation of the bonded logistics company, and the following text may be able to explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to a lot of milk powder factories and saw a lot of milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of powdered milk and liquid milk are the same, and there is no difference between them.
So why is the shelf life of the bagged product one year, while the shelf life of the canned product is two years or more?
Or another question: Why is the price difference between bagged and bulk so great?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers or mother-level think that it is because the raw materials are different that the quality is better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the expensive one is the good one.
There are also consumers who eat it because of this attitude and say that the taste or flavor is different after eating it!
Now, I want to talk to everyone about why it's so expensive. Where is it expensive?
Why is the price so different when the raw materials are the same?
Because when manufacturers set the price, most of them consider that if the bag price is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that the manufacturer's profit is very low, or there is no profit. So, how does the manufacturer survive?
So they had a very large increase in their pricing to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers focus on packaging in bags, rather than packaging in cans.
And there are so many manufacturers who spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising fees every year. Where do these fees come from?
It goes without saying.
Therefore, with the development of society and the promotion fee of the market, for example, the promotion personnel of the shopping mall, the display fee of the shopping mall, the gift fee of the product, the advertising fee, etc. are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are all in-ear, and the price is also constantly rising. In fact, this is due to the increase in the cost of the market.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, they do not hesitate to cooperate with doctors in hospitals, and the doctors will help to promote the products, and they will get a profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan from it.
On the other hand, the relevant laws in China are absolutely not allowed to operate in this way. In fact, this way of operation is to cheat the consumers.
If you have a can at home, you can buy a bag of powdered milk and put it in the can. This way, you can save money and increase the storage and sealing of the powdered milk, and it will not have any impact on the baby.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of hearing packs is longer than that of bag packs. If the shelf life of hearing packs and bag packs is the same after opening the bag, the bag packs are not easy to store and are prone to spoilage.
The delivery was late, and the food was all cold. After being cold, it was hard and stiff, and there was no way to eat it.
And the broth spilled over.

Don't scare people off the starting line - Xinhua
When you go to a book fair, you can often feel the popularity of books on success.
Today's self-help books are full of "best practices" -- that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, it skips over the "how to do it" part, which is actually the most important and fundamental part.
Because of this, all of these books have a common feature: they are either all-in or all-out; they are either 100 or 0; they are either climbing the mountain or staying put.
This "principle of the best" makes it so that whoever sees it will agree that it is "absolutely correct", but 99% of people will be scared off at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make a decision to change your life and make a 180-degree turn," which is a fatal flaw for a lot of people.
For people who are set in their ways, resistant to change, and unwilling to change, you deliberately shouting "you need to change" in their ears is an act of self-deception and foolishness.
Most people will be intimidated by the word "change" and hesitate to move forward; or they will make a rash decision to "change" based on a momentary impulse, and then bravely take the first step, but it is often that the good scene does not last long, and they cannot persist for a long time.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "From Tomorrow" comedy skit is the most classic expression of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem of the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people, making most people "sigh at the door".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a path that can lead more ordinary people to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages the theory that "small victories add up to big victories", that is, if you can't get to 100, getting to 1 is fine: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb to the top of Mount Tai, getting to the small sand dune in front of your house is fine, because that's better than standing still.
In short, it's better to do something than nothing at all.
Because the threshold has been greatly reduced, it is more likely that ordinary people will be able to persevere, and the success rate will also increase if they persevere in everything.
Following the "good enough" principle, the path to success is slightly longer.
In short, "the best principle" although it pretends to make everyone successful, in the end, it can only inspire a few; and "the second best principle" can effectively inspire more people and make more people benefit.

Qinghai Lake carp resource reserves increase by 0.71 tonnes this year - Xinhua
XINHUANET.com All Rights Reserved.
Qinghai Lake carp, also known as "Tibetan fish", is a rare fish species in Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain safety and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to the large-scale killing by humans and the degradation of breeding habitats, the number of Qinghai Lake crucian carp drastically decreased. In 2002, the stock of Qinghai Lake crucian carp was only 2,592 tons.
In the 2004 edition of the "Red Data Book of Chinese Species", the Qinghai Lake toadfish was listed as an endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a closed-lake breeding policy, prohibiting any organization, collective, or individual from fishing in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake, and prohibiting the sale of Qinghai Lake carp and its products.
At the same time, through the artificial propagation and release and the cleaning of the main inlet rivers of Qinghai Lake, as well as the design of scientific and reasonable "passage channels" and other measures, the protection intensity has been continuously strengthened, and the stock of Qinghai Lake carp has been increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that as of now, more than 180 million fish have been artificially bred and released into Qinghai Lake, accounting for more than 23% of the contribution to the recovery of Qinghai Lake carp resources.
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water source replenishment area for China and Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the ecological environment of Qinghai Lake, and to protect the diversity of wildlife in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued the prohibition of fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and built a comprehensive prohibition of fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

Wondering if it was an error in shipping, or if someone took it, thanks.

I just read a long article about fake holidays.
Give a heads-up to men who don't know.
Most girls will experience their first period between the ages of 13 and 15, and will go through menopause around the age of 50.
As long as you are in good health, you will come once a month on a regular basis.
But it's not a regularity that can be accurately predicted, with a tolerance of about a week, you need to prepare in advance, sometimes the luck is bad and it will also turn over (suddenly turn over several days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the severity of menstrual cramps vary from person to person. Some people bleed for three days, some for a week; some bleed little, some bleed a lot; some have no symptoms, and some are in so much pain that they need an ambulance. Menstrual cramps can change over time; what used to not hurt doesn't mean it won't hurt in the future.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and for a few days from the beginning to the end, blood flows continuously for 24 hours, and the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary napkins or sanitary towels to absorb the blood and prevent it from flowing onto the clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandin. If you have dysmenorrhea at the beginning of your menstruation, you can take ibuprofen to relieve the pain. However, if you have dysmenorrhea after the beginning of your menstruation, taking ibuprofen will have no effect.
During the premenstrual period, the uterus is filled with blood and excess progesterone is released, which makes it easy to get diarrhea.
If it's about that time, and you get a stomach ache for no reason, you'll have your period in about two days.
It is best to change sanitary napkins every 2-3 hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Excluding sleeping time, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, every month for 7 days, which is 42 pieces. If you add the preparation in advance, there may be 50 pieces, which is not one piece per month.
(Modify this a bit, you don't need to change the sanitary napkin frequently, you can change it every 5-6 hours or every 8 hours).
Hormones during the menstrual cycle can make you more irritable, and the hormonal changes during ovulation can make you more moody, which is very unfortunate, as your body is giving you a hard time.
However, the official crime rate data can show that women's ability to control emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional problems as an excuse.
The flow is not only blood, but also the shedding of the endometrium.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and it gradually becomes thicker, which can be understood as that the uterus is like a house, and builds a new house every month (the endometrium becomes thicker) to prepare for welcoming guests, but there are no guests, so everything is dismantled (menstrual blood is discharged), and the new house will be built again next month.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, continuous for several decades, bleeding for several days for 24 hours, accompanied by abdominal pain and back pain, who wants it?
However, people are able to be born because their mothers had their periods, and menstruation is for preparing the house that you will live in for 10 months when you first come to this world, so everyone should thank their mothers for having regular and healthy periods.
Society brainwashed women into thinking that a lot of things were dirty and shameful, but times have changed.
If anyone thinks that menstruation is disgusting, that the body's preparation for pregnancy is disgusting, they shouldn't say it in public, girls, stand up, don't think like that, you've never experienced it, you'll never experience it, and you don't know what's good or bad, these men who are so forgetful of gratitude, how can they face their own mothers, how can they want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary napkins, they are really good.
Today is the Winter Solstice, sending the wrong one is disappointing
You have to order a separate meal for the kids.
I hope the shop will check the product when they are busy.
Does a footbath make your feet tingle?
Choosing a suitable foot bath basin can have a good therapeutic effect on foot care. Today, the editor of Guomei will answer this question for you. I hope it will be helpful to friends.
With the improvement of people's health awareness, the whirlpool bathtub has become more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different grades have emerged in the market. From RMB100 to RMB1000, the whirlpool bathtub is full of all kinds of products, giving consumers a large choice space.
On the surface of the relevant data, the sales of foot baths and other health appliances are booming compared to traditional household appliances, but foot baths do not have a specific industry standard, so there is a certain safety hazard.
“Walking barefoot in electric water is really dangerous, isn’t it?”
Mr. Li told the reporter that he bought a footbath for his father as a birthday gift recently, but his father felt numb in his feet when he soaked his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the footbath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt the tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pencil, and the electric pencil lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the footbath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, although he gave up the foot bath basin, Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied.
Because he found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on the temperature setting, the applicable groups, the materials that ensure safety at the highest temperature, etc. for the popular footbath basin.
However, in general, footbath basins do not have electricity problems, but there are also some products that are not strictly inspected when they leave the factory.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a detachable footbath.
Water and electricity are separated, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take the pencil to measure at will.

Hou Shunli, Vice President of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Co-operatives, and Liu Hong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: the source of Lake Red in Xinhua is the rise of red tea, which injects new vitality into the "colorful Hubei tea".
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have actively supported the development of the tea industry, and promoted the construction of a billion-yuan tea industry, forming a development pattern of “three lakes, four rivers and five tea colors”.
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and green tea, black tea, and red tea, the main tea types, have successively launched, and the tea-tourism integration has been promoted in the main tea-producing areas, which has increased the income of tea farmers.
Feng shui changes, and red tea makes a comeback.
Industry experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea, they can pick red tea and black tea, and tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of the tea garden will increase directly.
At the opening ceremony, the leaders of the province awarded the plaques to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the “Hunan Red Tea” trademark, and Xihu brought the “Hunan Red Tea Origin”.
In the new tea hall of Xinhua Red Tea, Fujian tea merchants saw a high mountain tea called "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhen, secretary-general of the Tea Association of Zhejiang Province, said that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market to some extent, but from the Tea Expo, the highlights are abundant.
Xinhua Red Tea is one stroke of red, which injects the connotation of tea culture. It is popular and hot, and the tea industry in Hunan is welcoming a new spring.
So, if these foods aren't hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it, because there's no parking down there and he couldn't bring it up
Philosophy is the study of problems that cannot be answered by direct observation.
Metaphysics is the basic principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic properties of existence and the world.
The Chinese name "metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "The Dao is that which is above, and the De is that which is below" in the Yi Jing (Book of Changes), and was translated by the Japanese man, Ishizaka Tetsurō (Meiji era), from the word "metaphysics".
Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy that includes ontology, natural theology, and related issues.
Essentially, ontology is "the study of what terms represent real things, and what terms represent concepts."
Metaphysical naturalism, the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis assumes that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, which was proposed by philosophers supporting science and evolution.
The method of naturalism, on the other hand, is the study of God without reference to Him.
Psychophilosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body (particularly the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought on the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is the study of the nature, origins, and limits of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as a group of people or a culture's entire set of behavioral rules.
There are two main branches of ethics: meta-ethics (abstractly studying ethical theories or the nature of ethical judgments) and normative ethics (judging various different ethical views and providing ethical guidelines for right or wrong actions.
It studies what kinds of ethical standards people should follow), applied ethics (applying ethical theories to real-life situations, such as biomedical ethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and making generalizations from observed patterns).
It is not an examination of ethics from the perspective of an imagined theory, but an investigation of actual moral agents (moral agents) who make decisions, and are observed to make decisions, on the basis of all the moral factors involved in those decisions. It is an examination of the ethical views of social groups.
The history of ethics includes ancient Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
Part 1: Humanist ethics, represented by Valla and Montaigne, among others.
The second part: the ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
The third part: political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, English empiricism ethics, representatives: Hume, 17-18th century, continental rationalism ethics, representatives: Spinoza, 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, representatives: Voltaire, 18-19th century, German idealism ethics, representatives: Kant and Hegel, 18-19th century, utilitarian ethics, representatives: Spencer and Huxley, 19th century, evolutionary ethics, representatives: Spencer and Haeckel, 19th century, neo-Kantianism ethics, representatives: Kierkegaard, 19th century, neo-Hegelianism ethics, representatives: Thomas Hill Green, 19th century, and transitional ethics (non-rationalism ethics, representatives: Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer).
Logic is the study of the principles and standards of valid inference and proof.
Logic usually consists of three parts: Inductive reasoning, Causal reasoning and Deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
Aesthetics is the study of the essence and meaning of beauty.

Ding Zilin: To My Friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the past 30-odd years since our relatives were killed. In particular, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the humanitarian assistance that has continued uninterrupted since 1994, when I made an appeal for humanitarian assistance in my personal capacity to friends both at home and abroad.
Nowadays, most of the deceased's parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and have jobs.
It was your generosity that helped us get through the most difficult times.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc across the globe, and most of the donors are retirees.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop the humanitarian donation to our families - the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian assistance activity should have ended a long time ago.
I will always remember your kindness and believe that your act will be recorded in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, and I hope my friends will understand.
Please accept my sincere greetings.
Tao Yi made the following remarks: I would like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the history of the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars in the United States (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) for 32 years of humanitarian assistance.
In the process of doing humanitarian assistance, the American Association of University Women and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the implementers of the project often cross each other.
（图：天安门母亲网站由陶业负责管理。）pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Assistance money often fails to reach the hands of the Tiananmen victims.
In 1994, under the suggestion of Master Ding, a special group was set up by the "Mothers of Tiananmen Square" to coordinate and handle the humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "June 4 Orphans Education Fund", which was implemented for 11 years, and in 2009, after all the June 4 orphans graduated from university, MCDF set up the "June 4 Poor Elderly Special Assistance Fund", which has been implemented until today.
Most of the funding for these projects comes from donations from campuses and the community in 1989, as well as from personal donations, and from the support of the National Endowment for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Rehabilitation Research Fund.
Until last year, after 31 years, the Tiananmen Square victims finally received part of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of Tiananmen in 1989.
During this time, China Human Rights also carried out its humanitarian assistance projects independently.
We understand that Professor Ding stopped accepting donations for the Tiananmen Square Massacre was for the consideration of donors, most of whom are retirees, and their income is not as generous as when they were working. We would like to express our gratitude to Professor Ding for his “Letter to Friends”.
We will respect the family's decision and end the project within two years and, if necessary, immediately resume it.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those colleagues who, for many years, have been steadfast in their generosity, risking their lives to deliver humanitarian aid.

Time Capsule Photography: No Branches Yet
Member reviews
Effect: Photo effect: took two outfits, overall it's not bad, I like the photo set.
Service details: Because I was pregnant, I felt a little uncomfortable when I was doing makeup. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate. They let me rest for a while and kept pouring me hot water.
Set price: 1000 yuan
Thanks to the rabbit's review. I originally said that I didn't like the ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thanks to Dandan's recognition, our satisfaction will make us full of power to continue to move forward. We will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great! I highly recommend it to all my friends!
No matter from the reception, make-up, costume, lighting, photography to post-production, there is nothing to complain about.
The make-up artist is very meticulous, he will match the make-up according to your style, and the make-up products used are all first-line brands.
Tian Liang Teacher is even more so. Photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better photo studios in Beijing need to make an appointment half a year in advance. My colleague has taken photos in Beijing, and I looked at the pictures and thought they were just so so.
I went out of my way to find this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We are not good at managing our facial expressions, and we think that this is also the short version of most people. Photographer Liang Gao will take pictures and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, post-production, an excellent team.
We and those around us are raving about it.
I've already recommended her to my friends, and my friends were just as happy as I was when they saw the photos.
I hope that such studios will not be buried, and more people will find them, shoot their own style, and not be the same as everyone else.
Thank you very much for the five-star review from Chengying and Jingling, both of whom are very creative newcomers. We are a creative workshop, and we will do our best to satisfy our customers. Thank you for meeting and getting to know each other.
The sweet and caring assistant, as well as the lively and energetic photographer teacher, all the members of the team are super nice. It was a wonderful shooting experience, and the effect of the shooting was much better than I imagined. Everyone worked hard, and I am very grateful to all of you. 😘😘
Thank you, Xiaoyu, for your comments. Meeting you is also a kind of destiny. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust is thousands of kilometers away. I am very happy to meet you. If there is an opportunity, I will come to Qinhuangdao to play again.
How do I give money?

A programming novice who wants to share personal experience.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to self-study. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, we need to look at the strength of the teaching force of this institution. If the teaching force is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some new training institutions do not have a strong teaching force.
Second, inquire about the training institution before choosing. It is best to inquire about the students of the training institution. After all, only the students of the training institution know how good or bad the training institution is.
Hello, actually, I don't know how to answer your question, because I didn't make a certain introduction to your own situation, and the relationship between learning this thing and your own situation is very big.
For example, the field of study, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you want to study in, will all be related to your field of study or the field you want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you are a computer major who has graduated, I recommend self-study if you have enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way, and now many offline and online training institutions are very good, but the learning cost is high, and the investment of time is also relatively large, and it needs to be concentrated for 3-6 months.
However, if it is what I said, self-study is very convenient. There are a lot of learning resources on the Internet that are free, and there are also a lot of training resources on B站. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos to learn.
If you are not a computer major, but you are willing to pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, it is recommended to go to the training institution to learn. This way, learning is not very tiring, the teacher's explanation is very detailed, and there are people to answer questions. In addition, the learning plan or supervision can also help.
Moreover, nowadays, many training institutions will sign employment agreements, and there will be in-house placement quotas. After studying, they will recommend you to go to the company. This will also save you a lot of trouble in the interview stage when looking for a job.
The above is some of my views. Since I do not know your situation, I have only briefly introduced it. If you have other questions to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication and exchange.
I said 10 minutes before, I saw it on the app

My day-to-day work
——Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, and keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggu housekeeping can do it for you.

Crystal lamps are beautiful, but if they are not cleaned for a long time, they will become dull and lifeless. Only after cleaning can they shine brightly
Only with sincerity can success be achieved, and only with meticulousness can exquisiteness be molded. We are sincere.
Give me a chance, I will make you satisfied, quality proves everything, because professional deserves to be trusted, your recognition is my encouragement!
It's hard to make a living in any field these days!
But I always believed that, as long as I was serious, as long as I was persistent, as long as I was hard-working, I would be better than others, at least I would be better than sitting and complaining, wouldn't I?
Everything good starts in the morning, hope you bring happiness, good luck, health and good luck to start a new day, keep a good mood all day long. Good morning
When I was a child, happiness was a thing; if you had it, you were happy; if you didn't, you weren't. When I grew up, happiness was a goal; if you achieved it, you were happy; if you didn't, you weren't. As I matured, I realized that happiness was a state of mind; if you understood it, you were happy; if you didn't, you weren't.
Be the truest and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; there is only one path in life; two treasures in life: a healthy body and a good mood, live happily until you die!
Every stage of life has its own set of challenges.
Often, it's not your abilities that hold you back, but your courage.
If you can't avoid it, you might as well face it.
The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be defeated by difficulties; the more you rise to the challenge, the more problems will be solved.
Sino-Saudi curators team up to hold the first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia - Xinhuanet
XINHUANET.com All Rights Reserved.
This biennale was jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. The artistic director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, Ding Yi, was in charge of the artistic supervision.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is "crossing the river by feeling the stones," which symbolizes the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six exhibition halls connected to each other. The six units are: "Touching the Rock to Cross the River", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, covering painting, installation art, and performance art, etc. The works of 12 Chinese artists were also well-received, some of whom used recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing in his series of works "Infinite Mountains of Xishan" (2014), which reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
The executive director of the Dhahran Equestrian Festival Foundation, Barkley, said that he hoped that this year's Biennale would establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to get to know the vibrant cultural industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia, and strengthen exchanges.
Tian Huiyu said, "The goal of the biennale is double, not only to let Saudi contemporary art participate in the global dialogue, but also to let Saudi audiences integrate into the contemporary art world. "
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennale, with opinion leaders from the art, curating and creative industries discussing topics such as intercultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhuanet
XINHUANET.com All Rights Reserved.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Department of Human Resources and Social Security of Yunnan Province, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare jobs, which are used to employ rural poor and other disadvantaged groups in rural areas, and play an important role in helping the poverty-stricken groups achieve employment and increase income, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the public services in rural areas.
The new regulation was jointly issued by the seven departments of Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and other departments. It mainly unified the scope of the object of recruitment of public welfare positions in rural areas, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions.
In terms of position development, the new regulation clearly stipulates that position development should be carried out in accordance with the principle of “who needs, who is assigned, dynamic management, and total control”, “who develops, who uses, and who is responsible”, and “one person, one position, voluntary publicity, and unified management”.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the procedures of announcement, application, review, publicity, appointment, pre-employment training and placement.
In addition, the new regulation also clearly stipulates the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare positions, and stipulates that the relevant development departments of rural public welfare positions should purchase accident insurance for rural public welfare position settlers. It also stipulates that the relevant departments should regularly monitor the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.
The address was wrong
Hello
Is it possible to cancel an order?
I re-ordered.
Has it been cancelled?
Secondly, although the rightists have had a period of prosperity in history, it was not long, so they are short-lived because they shine when they get a little sunshine and sweat when they drink a little water; they are also short-lived because they look up to Sichuan when they are prosperous and suffer a setback when they are defeated.
However, objectively speaking, the right wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
From ending the definition of the standard of truth during the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and the protection of human rights, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
Three, in my opinion, although I do not agree with some of Li Weidong's views, I am very concerned about his views, and I also respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere about China's social problems.
However, I oppose his anti-communist theory, I believe that anti-revolution is necessary, revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, people's livelihood will be damaged, political groups will be mixed and muddled, and foreigners will take advantage of the opportunity.
Fourthly, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people. Political machinations for personal gain are not rightists, they are scoundrels.
Let's talk about it again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of orphans of time and politics.
If the right has a positive effect on society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing views and analyses of their thoughts at the right time, but the left has none of this, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Five, I recently saw some friends scolding the robbers and refuting the leftists, and they were quite energetic. I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to reason with a traitor or a leftist. They're all the same, they're all rotten to the core.
And don't try to prove that we're right, and don't try to make the bandits and the leftists admit it, what's the point?
I tell my friends: when the robbers insult you for five cents, when the leftists insult you as right-wingers, it is precisely at that moment that we are on the right path!
Many people had dreams when they were young, but as they grew older, they forgot their dreams or pursued them obsessively.
And as the ideal recedes further and further, even the dragon slayer becomes a dragon.
Generally, I think left and right refer to constraints and freedoms. Historically and culturally, China is inherently left-leaning.
While the right-wing focuses on efficiency and development, the left-wing focuses on regulation and more on fairness and safety.
In general, the society wants to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, China and the United States are competing with each other, and the left is undoubtedly. It is estimated that it will continue for a long time.
Even though I don't understand, I'll just give it a thumbs up.
It's pointless to say anything. Flower Flower is just that kind of person.
In the past two years, the blockade and encirclement of Huawei's chips by the US empire has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-based" enterprises.
The United States suppresses China's semiconductor industry, and requires its own enterprises and allied countries' enterprises to simultaneously block China's semiconductor industry. The direct consequence is that the global semiconductor supply chain is affected, and the orders and profits of semiconductor manufacturing enterprises are affected. As a result, the research and development investment of semiconductor manufacturing enterprises is reduced, and the production capacity is reduced. As a result, the global semiconductor supply chain is in chaos.
Today, the "chip shortage" has affected all major industries around the world, such as car manufacturers suspending production and mobile phones increasing in price. Almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to grasp the "chip" sovereignty, more and more countries' science and technology giants are walking on the road of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor power, suppress the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has been busy recently, and has held the semiconductor summit; has invited 64 major countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and has provided funding to support the technology giants of the United States, such as Intel, the old technology giant of the United States, has invested 2 billion US dollars to build two semiconductor factories in Arizona, USA, and has opened semiconductor manufacturing business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's action this time would have a certain impact on TSMC, and it was very likely to steal TSMC's "plate".
This is because Intel, as a veteran technology giant in the United States, has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for dozens of years, and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves. Therefore, it is certain that it will rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was indifferent.
At the "2021 Master's Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou's words were shocking. He said that Intel's investment to build a semiconductor foundry was very ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou's disdain for Intel's entry into the semiconductor industry is due to the fact that Zhang Zhongmou still remembers the grudge between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel in the crown of the American manufacturing industry, and was the world leader in the semiconductor industry.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were in the hands of a few elites.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured, and packaged by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model burdens some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs cannot afford the huge construction cost of the production line.
Under the influence of market demand, in the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to show the phenomenon of division of labor cooperation, and in 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality with the birth of TSMC.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) focuses its main business on "wafer fabrication," which is a single process, and does not engage in design. It only provides contract manufacturing services for semiconductor wafers.
At the time, the newly established TSMC was just a small fry in the face of Intel, the giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had once contacted Intel for investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC only does the manufacturing process of the semiconductor industry, it was obviously somewhat arrogant and looked down on TSMC, so it decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel at the time looked down on wafer fabrication services.
Nobody would have thought that the giants who used to look down on wafer manufacturing services would also have to start doing wafer manufacturing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into wafer foundry was ironic.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) market value has already surpassed that of Intel.
Faced with TSMC's strong offensive, Intel, of course, will not be able to stand still.
Today, TSMC is pushing towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
I'm impatient.
I ordered at 19:06 after 2 hours 😅
Let's take a look at some of today's [weird] hot searches.
What is normal public opinion?
Select three trending topics at random: Lunar New Year's Day on February 2nd, Hualun's price increase, and the Pinglala incident. The spread of the news forms a peak, and then the index decreases (smooth line) and finally dissipates. If secondary news is generated, there will be a small peak again.
They look exactly the same as the "network sentiment evolution model" shown on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six trending topics from the same event to present the "peak", "sawtooth" and "cliff" patterns.
The "Peak" is artificially heated and quickly climbed to the hot search, attracting the attention of the public; the "Sawtooth" is cyclically heated to ensure that the topic occupies the hot search rankings; the "Cliff" is collectively withdrawn, and the hot search has fulfilled its "function", and received a new task, and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time difference is only one second. It must be that a batch of water army received the task and launched a new round of attack.
The professionalism of black public relations can be seen from the fact that dozens of trending topics were listed at the same time. Which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for disseminating knowledge, which ones provoke war, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones arouse emotions, which ones influence decisions, and which ones entangle decisions, black public relations accounts operate in batches and in stages, almost considering all factors in the spread of public opinion.
Propaganda is a science. Disregarding all subjective factors, such as opinions and emotions, only objective data can escape black public relations.
Every step leaves a trace, and we dig them out together.

Mauritius and other countries discover the first case of omicron infection - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 - Combined reports by Xinhua News Agency correspondents: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant on 10 December.
According to Kalisha Jagutpal, the Minister of Health, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27, and the other is a local resident who was in contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the two infected persons tested negative for nucleic acid. They have returned to their respective residences.
The Health Ministry of Cyprus announced on the 10th that the first three cases of omicron infection were confirmed in the country.
All three are students, and returned from overseas trips earlier this month. They are all mild cases, and have not been hospitalized.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Senegalese government has continued to strengthen its prevention and control measures.
From December 6 to January 10, all passengers aged 12 and above entering the country by air will be required to pay for a nucleic acid test upon arrival at the airport.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it would start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with Pfizer's new coronavirus vaccine.
Malawi's health minister, Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, said on 9th that the country had detected 3 cases of omicron variant infection for the first time.
The country's health department sequenced the genomes of 12 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three cases.

At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look. At first, my budget was 70,000 yuan to do a basic renovation.
The scam starts as soon as you walk in the door.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan, and they didn't go to the site to measure the house, but they were able to give me a price of 70,000 yuan for my 135 square meter house, and they roughly showed me their materials, but I didn't know what kind of materials they were.
Their second trick is that if you go to their store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and this deposit is not refundable unless you have enough experience to deal with them).
When I was hesitating whether or not to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we will give you a certain amount of discount.
That's a big hole, and I'm just an example of being conned. I paid a deposit of 10,000 yuan.
He gave me an offer of RMB 70,000, which did not include water and electricity renovation, nor did it include any doors and cabinets for the bathroom and kitchen, which are the biggest expenses in the base renovation.
They charge more for their services than other companies.
I lost trust in this company from the beginning, when they didn't explain anything to me and made me sign a contract.
When I went to get my money back they acted like they knew what they were doing, they had a special little team to deal with me.
No matter what, they will bite off more than they can chew, and it will be the customer's fault.
Various shifting of responsibility, as well as many details, I do not want to say one by one, tears, in general, do not choose them, because my friend also found them to decorate the house, the quality of the house is also not good, and they will give you various fees in the future.
It's a scam, they're just the original con artists, now rebranded as the Big Beautiful. It's like they've gone bust again and rebranded as something else.
So, don't choose such a shitty decoration company.
In the future, everyone should search on Baidu when choosing, and check these inquiries. After all, the renovation is not a small amount of money.

Constellation has a date: Gemini meteor shower peaks on the 14th - Xinhuanet
XINHUANET.com All Rights Reserved.
A view of the Geminid meteor shower captured by Beijing amateur astronomer Angu on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai, China.
The parent body of most meteor showers is a periodic comet, but the parent body of the Pleiades meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not produced by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society Councilor and Astronomy Popularization Expert Shu Lianpeng introduced that just like the New Year's blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year. "The screening period" can last from December 4 to December 17.
The Perseid meteor shower is known for its high rate and stability, and is one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere along with the Quadrantid meteor shower and the Geminid meteor shower.
One of the distinctive features of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteors are slow, colorful, and there are many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and amateur astronomical photography.
Yang Jing, an amateur astronomer from Tianjin, captured the Geminid meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Tiantai County, Tianjin.
According to the astronomical forecast, the Geminid meteor shower will reach its peak at around 15:00 on December 14, with ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observation conditions, when the radiant point is directly above the observer's head) reaching 150.
The Geminid Meteor Shower Recommendation Index Chart.
Last year's Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the brilliance will be slightly reduced.
On the 14th, it was the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, and the lunar phase was a waxing gibbous moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, but fortunately, the moon will fall in the later half of the night. At this time, the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe at night after the moon sets, but they should pay attention to preventing cold.
How can you see as many meteors as possible?
“Don’t observe in the city, but in the suburbs or the countryside, choose a place with a clear view to the northeast, at a high altitude, with little light pollution, and wait until the moon has set before observing visually.
It should be noted that the flow rate of the Geminid meteor shower in all directions is very large, so you don't have to stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower all the time when observing.
Friends who like photography should choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens to shoot a colorful “meteor shower ” . When shooting, use high ISO and maximum aperture.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, tripods, spare batteries and shutter cables are also indispensable. ”
Xu Lianpeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the OP should be liquid crystal TV, and the difference between laser TV and liquid crystal TV in terms of market positioning mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the comprehensive layout of the liquid crystal TV market, the laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or the laser TV itself is a product born for the large screen.
Currently, the mainstream liquid crystal televisions have sizes ranging from 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser televisions have sizes ranging from 75 inches to over 100 inches, fully meeting users' needs for large-screen color televisions.
In recent years, the shipment and sales volume of laser TVs have been increasing globally, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales volume of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of CINNO Research, the sales volume of laser TV market will increase by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason why it has achieved such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV, the laser light source does not directly enter the eye, and the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of natural objects than the backlight source of liquid crystal TV. The stimulation to the eye is also smaller.
The 144 sets of test data were obtained by the strict comparison test between laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions of the population. The test was carried out by the experts from the Sesi Laboratory of the China Electronics Technology Standards Research Institute and the ophthalmology experts from the Beijing Friendship Hospital.
Data confirms that laser TVs do indeed have very strong anti-eye strain properties, and in some respects even have a certain improvement effect.
With the increasing attention to eye health, laser TV has not only attracted more and more users with its eye-saving advantage, but also opened a new breakthrough point in the color TV market.
Secondly, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
While the price of liquid crystal televisions continues to fall, the current market price of laser televisions is mostly above RMB 10,000. As the size and light source are upgraded, the price will gradually rise.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
There's got to be some truth to that.
With the development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD TV and projector.
Thanks to the super-short focal length projection technology, the laser TV's projection distance is relatively shorter than that of traditional projection devices. It can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance, and the main unit is small and takes up little space.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 nits.
In addition, the heat dissipation is lower, and the equipment consumption is small, so the service life of the television is also longer.
Besides, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, biomimetic screen and other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users more shocking visual and auditory experience.
It is not a false demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and cost-benefit ratio, laser TV is not the favorite of video players. If you want to enjoy the big screen and viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has its pros and cons. After weighing the pros and cons, we can judge for ourselves. We should not be influenced by one-sided words.
In simple terms, ultra-wide-angle near-field projectors -- laser TVs -- have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors to get close to the screen, which goes against the best optical design.
To block some of the ambient light, a microstructured Fresnel screen is used, which is expensive, and the price of an 80-inch screen is basically equivalent to that of a 65-inch LCD.
And one more thing, I really hate when the projector manufacturers use the "reflected light is good for the eyes" as a selling point, please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is the direct light, even if you reflect it to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it, so why do you have to compare the LCD TV which is also "reflected light"? And the ceiling is also lit up when you turn on the TV, isn't it?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not a diffuse reflector, it will not become an image.
The hot spots (hot spots) of the high gain screen are deliberately ignored, and it is only when a large amount of light is reflected to the eyes from a certain angle that it is really uncomfortable.
The Visual Arts Photography Gallery Selects Quality Stores Temporarily Without Branches
After adding the WeChat appointment date, the little sister arranged the available time for me and replied to me in a timely manner.
Before going, I looked at the shooting works in the store, which were mostly outdoor wedding dresses, and the shooting was very beautiful. There are many shooting styles involved.
After arriving on the day, I briefly exchanged my ideas with the little sister. She was very patient and helped me try two sets of clothes that I was confused about. In the end, we decided to start makeup and hairstyle. The photographer will arrange some props before shooting. He will also guide the movements and pay attention to the details.
However, it may be because I didn't communicate my specific shooting ideas with him, so the result was not what I wanted, but it should be a good-looking one🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help select the photos and discuss the post-processing style. He is quite considerate.
It takes about half a month to repair the film, and then wait for the effect.
The second time I took part in the photo-shooting feast. Most of the clothes in the venue can be chosen for one photo-shooting.
I chose a black chiffon dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is the younger brother of the 95 generation, and he feels a little shy. I hope that in the future, he can give more suggestions on the guidance of customer shooting movements. He is quite talkative, and the shooting process is quite pleasant.

Go to the home page and check out Queenie!
When I went to the store, I first filled in my name and phone number, and then chose clothes. Wedding dresses and bridal gowns can also be chosen. I tried on three or four sets of clothes, and the staff was very patient. After that, I had my makeup done for a long time, and the service attitude was also good. After that, they will teach you how to pose, and it will take about half a month to retouch. It took about four days to send it to me, and it felt like there was no difference between the original picture and the retouched one.
Overall, it's not too bad.
There are a lot of optional clothes.
There are about three make-up stations, and there is a photo studio in the middle.
Very friendly and attentive.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you the moves.
If the photographer is not satisfied, he will also proactively ask for re-shooting.
【Experience】The eyelid may be a little too exaggerated, and the original double eyelid was pasted out as a triple eyelid.
The eyebrows were also shaved, which is a bit awkward for those who do not draw eyebrows every day.
The photos were given to me within a few days, but I wasn't very satisfied with the P-taking effect. I felt that the double eyelid tapes were still very obvious.
Because I didn't know what kind of style I wanted, I tried two sets, and in the end, I chose the black dress. The little sister said that this set is more of a Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, the makeup and hairstyle began. The makeup artist and hairstylist sisters were very patient in helping me. I was very satisfied with the effect.
Makeup and hair done, it's time to take photos. The photographer guided me to pose throughout the process. It was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the shoot, I carefully selected four photos that I liked the most, and the little brother said that they would be ready in 15 minutes. The ending was very satisfied.
I've been waiting 3 days for a reply... because your system can't recognise my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card to pay
I have to pay for shipping every time
Could you waive my monthly fees until you've finished your investigation?
Is it safe to buy an umbrella with insurance?
Rain Umbrella is an online insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the suggestion of the Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015), in order to become an insurance brokerage institution, the following three key words must be met: the shareholders and founders must have no major violations of the law in the past three years, the minimum amount must be RMB 500 million, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three are very strict, and can be summarized as having the ability and being approved by the national authority of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (regulates all domestic insurance companies and banks). The shareholders must have a good reputation, and as a small umbrella insurance, the policyholders do not need to question whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate. After all, there are these three thresholds, and not all insurance companies can meet them.
On this point, it's good, it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform. For example, the newly launched Super Mary 5th Critical Illness Insurance of Anda Life Insurance Co., Ltd. is underwritten by Anda Life Insurance Co., Ltd., and Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to doubt its reliability.
From the payment mode: the Internet platform's product is because of the lack of the cost of the operation of the business outlets and the cost of the salary of the business personnel, so the Internet product has a relatively high price-performance ratio, and the payment method is flexible, and supports monthly payment, which can reduce the pressure of the insured person's payment, and at the same time can maximize the lever of the insurance.
That's still pretty good.
Consider it.
From the professionalism of the agent: this point is particularly important, because insurance is an industry that requires a high degree of professionalism, and many Internet product customers can themselves purchase insurance. This will inevitably lead to a lot of misconceptions in health disclosure and occupation, and non-insurance professionals will often add their own subjective judgments when purchasing insurance, thinking that they are healthy or meet the requirements, which will inevitably lead to a lot of claims denial risks.
I myself used to sell insurance over the phone for "Tencent Micro Insurance" (which is also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Insurance on the Internet is real and reliable, but unreliable is the people, the Internet channel does not have professional personnel, and there are many sales misdirection.
For example: 1 yuan insurance for 6 million, buy insurance and get a mobile phone for free, free to receive 60,000 yuan of critical illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are superficial, they will not tell the policyholders that the first month is 1 yuan, and the second month is charged according to the normal fee, ranging from a few dozen to 200 yuan, and many customers do not know what they are buying.
Think you can get away with paying $1, but the insurance company is on the hook for $600,000.
Free mobile phone, it is only sent to special insurance number, such as 6666, 8888, and if the winning text message is sent out, you do not exchange it, and no one reminds you.
（This is another pitfall for the insured) Free to get 60,000 RMB of critical illness insurance, which is short-term. If only relying on this, without any other commercial insurance, what can 60,000 RMB do in the event of a critical illness? It will not be able to solve any problems in the future.
Currently, the government is also cracking down on the misleading of Internet insurance sales.
So, overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
Suggesting that the OP should consider comprehensively, in fact, many offline insurance agencies have more products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products have better cost-benefit ratios than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to insure their offline products and save RMB2,000-3,000 per person per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
I: an insurance broker with 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, I have served more than 1,000 enterprise users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I will start from the needs of customers to customize insurance products for customers. During the purchase process, I will do my best to get the best underwriting results for customers. After purchasing insurance, I will help customers organize their insurance certificates, manage their insurance certificates, and let customers feel at ease and worry-free.
To grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the OP!
According to the definition of the insurance regulator, the Internet insurance is the insurance business that the insured person can complete all the insurance procedures by clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured person does not need to sign, the insurance advisor does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured person independently.
Although there is not much "ceremony" in online insurance registration, and it may even be that there is no printed version of the paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to "phone sales" in general, but such a purchase of insurance will also have a fatal problem - the after-sales service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for several decades. When we buy insurance, we should think carefully about the "intermediary" we choose. Is it an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us in many years later?

From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and abuse, and I will not tolerate this kind of personal attack.
In a civilized society, we can be tolerant of everything, but we must not tolerate this sort of scoundrel.
If you don't look at parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you started sending friend requests on Facebook, followed by posting statuses with a humorous tone, and then trying to post the alleged location of my house and my father's name on social media, I've taken a no-response approach.
You continued to tag me relentlessly after the fact, not only at the frequency of six meals a day, but also on Facebook with your so-called friends, continuing to discuss me in veiled, humiliating ways about my looks, my body, my good genes, my bedroom antics, whether or not I wanted to be fucked, and so on.
How do I know that later, I received more than one friend's messages about you uploading a photo of you on your Facebook friend's account with sexual harassment content.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After my report, you became even more brazen.
I don't care what your political background is, and I don't care what your social status is. In our society, we need to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue with the jokes, the innuendos, the humiliation, the insults, the harassment. You can continue to say that you're just concerned and caring about me, you can continue to say that it's not harassment, you can continue to deny that it's not your art, you can continue to say whatever you want.
No, you're right, I can't and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't care what you think of me.
I don't even think there's a girl out there who would be willing to put herself through that kind of humiliation just to be famous.
A friend asked me how I was doing.
I said I wouldn't, and you didn't believe me.
I don't think any girl would be able to say that after being raped.
Whether in the workplace, in society, in politics, or in business, only those without any basic decency would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice will prevail.
I've copied some of the comments for you to judge
You shouldn't be able to impersonate yourself, right?
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization
A hearty laugh

The high-speed rail residence
Address: No. 555, North 1st Road of High-speed Railway
There are relatively complete household appliances and home appliances here, and there are many brands, and there are famous brands.
During the Double 12, I went to the "Hansdon" water purifier store to see the water purifier, and there was a promotion in the store. The price was relatively cheap.
There are 11 floors in Courtyard by Marriott, from the second floor to the ninth floor, the first and second floors are parking lots, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not very good, there are very few restaurants and hardware stores, and the food in the restaurants is not very good.
This elevator is also very ridiculous, just like having that big illness, from the 2nd floor to the 1st floor, up and down, I kept pressing this floor, from the emergency exit to the 1st floor, it is also very ridiculous, it is directly connected to a furniture store, the furniture store is closed, and the emergency exit cannot be exited!
Rong e-commerce still needs to improve, and there are many places that have not been developed.
Address: No. 555, High-speed North 1 Road, Xayibakkar District, Urumqi. Convenient transportation, large parking lot, and free parking during the day.

Many well-known brands have entered the store, such as MUJI, OUPAI, HUATAI, LAOBAN, FENGCHENZHOU, YACHT, YADAN, FENGQILE, WANJIALU, DAXIAN, MIDE, YADAN, etc. The number of brands is really too many, and I can only remember so many. It is a good place to buy products. If you are tired, you can sit on the sofa and rest.
Recently, I wanted to buy a comfortable sofa, and my friend said that there are many sofas to choose from here. I looked at the sofas of Guangzhou Home Furnishing and Midea, and felt that they were okay, but they were a little expensive, so I was still in a dilemma.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (reported by Wang Xian) - The Chongqing Yuzhong Water Green Integrated Service Area was officially put into operation on the 10th, which is the second water green integrated service area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Lushan Water Green Integrated Service Area in Lushan, Sichuan Province was officially put into operation on the 8th.
With this, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Mr. Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, said that before, the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had built and put into operation 10 green integrated service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were well received by ship crews, and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.

Three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China; the most powerful weapon in the U.S. Navy's arsenal has made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to the U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the "South China Sea Strategic Sensing Platform" of China's think tank, on January 9, the satellite detected the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the First Island Chain of the West Pacific.
The platform expects the "Carl Vinson" to deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" ship-based transport aircraft on the USS "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier.
The U.S. Navy aircraft carrier currently patrolling the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, is the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the first F-35C carrier-based squadron, belonging to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
Besides the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the United States Navy also has the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76) aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The carrier strike group also includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville and the guided-missile destroyer USS Stockdale.
The South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform released the latest satellite images on January 17, 2022, showing that three U.S. aircraft carriers were gathering in the vicinity of China.
（South China Sea Strategic Situation Sensing Weibo） The three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon is rarely visiting Guam. On January 17, 2022, the U.S. Navy CMV-22B transport aircraft flight route.
（South China Sea Strategic Situation Sensing Weibo）According to the United States Cable Television News Network (CNN) on January 17, the most powerful weapon in the US Navy's weapons warehouse visited Guam last weekend.
The nuclear-powered Ohio-class submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
Three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China, and the world's most powerful weapon is rarely visiting Guam. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first time a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016, and the second time it has publicly visited Guam since the 1980s.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China, and the world's most powerful weapon is rarely visiting Guam. China has been building a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
Photo shows China's Yongxing Island in the Nansha Islands.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine USS Nevada's visit to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrated the United States' capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "boomers".
The whereabouts of the 14 U.S. Navy submarines of the "Thunderbolt" class are usually a closely guarded secret.
The secret around the ballistic missile submarine made the "Thunderbolt submarine" the "most important survival weapon" of the "nuclear triad" system, which also includes the missile launch site on the U.S. mainland and the B-2 and B-52 bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about Meta's recent plunge of 26% and market cap evaporation of $251 billion, Zuckerberg responds, "We're facing competition like we've never seen before."
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising agency, and its main source of income is advertising. Today's money-making advertising agencies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, regardless of the functional positioning, are the traffic channels of Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", many apps are connected to Meta's advertising platform through Meta's advertising platform to realize monetization.
But the times, they are a-changin'.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is no longer able to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and will clearly prompt the user whether to allow the app to obtain their information. Most people's normal reaction is to not allow it.
If Google sticks another knife in, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, China's contribution to Meta's revenue growth in the past has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mostly from Chinese companies doing business overseas.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is probably a few hundred people, and there are several agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel. Most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, now TT is one of Meta's main competitors, but two years ago, Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance.
All of China's agents are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but I'm sure it's not better than before.
The era of large-scale spending by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets don't just look at current income, they look at future expectations.
Clearly, Meta's expectations were not met.
To tell a new story for the market, Zuckerberg talked about "the metaverse."
The metaverse is definitely a direction for the future, but the realization period of the metaverse is quite long, and this story is not enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
Therefore, in the next two years, Meta should be a relatively difficult period.
Don't be fooled by Facebook's glossy veneer. It's actually in a lot of trouble, with annual revenues of $10 billion to $20 billion, and no good security moat to protect it from other Internet companies and high-tech firms.
Although the number of daily active users of his social software is relatively high now, and it is a mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook also has no confidence to disrupt, and it is only a blink of an eye.
While the concept of Metaverse, which is an unattainable concept in the short term, has no chance of success, Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg keeps changing the name of the company and keeps looking for new tracks. However, I think that his track selection is wrong, and it is a dead end. The above is my thoughts for reference.
