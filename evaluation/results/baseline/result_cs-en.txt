A big comeback of the Czech loser is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
The Czech ice hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 30-year-old Plzeň native will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Exactly halfway through the game against Vegas, he was substituted and has not appeared on the ice of the NHL since then.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one post to the other.
“Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with an injury to his lower body,” the team from Denver announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL net lasted more than two months.
He was recalled from the farm, where he played four games and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he had a save percentage of 94.5%.
A product of Plzeň hockey, he wants to finally prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In his last season, he had problems with his knees, and in the shortened pandemic season, he did not play a single match.
In the NHL, the "Frenchman" played 36 games, with a success rate of 92.3%.
Charles wears a mask on his Christmas card as William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also made his wishes known, posting an image of himself helping his wife Camilla to put on a face mask during a race.
This was reported by the British news agency BBC on its website.
They send greetings to their friends, colleagues and charities with whom they work.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing a long summer dress in khaki and so is Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shorts and polo shirt as Prince George and Louis.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate did not say, nor is it clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the Royal Family posed for a photograph destined as a Christmas greeting card in front of a pile of logs at their country estate in Norfolk.
The picture that serves as a Christmas greeting was also published by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured him racing at Ascot in June.
Charles, who is wearing a cylinder on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask, which matches her white dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminal investigators in the current corruption scandal allegedly worked on the assumption that the former vice-president of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr had been promised one million Czech crowns from Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
According to the efotbal.cz server, he had access to a part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that Sparta did not engage in any corrupt practices.
The server published a transcript of the police recordings, in which Slavia's former sporting director Jan Nezmar, who left the club last summer, features prominently.
The former influential functionary of the Red-Whites was, according to the indictment, in frequent contact with both Berbra and Roman Rogoz, the former sports director of then second-league Vyšehrad, who is also among the accused.
The police allegedly worked with the information that Slavia had promised Berbrovi a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the first league title.
The law enforcement agency had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to receive a million-crown bribe from the Slavia Prague club officials, cited the file.
The next day, according to criminal investigators, Berbr not only met with Nezmar, but also with Slavia's chairman Tvrdík.
It is not clear from the file whether the police are still investigating this information.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt practices.
From 2015 to 2017 we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed an illegal act, we have not tried to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not paid anyone any financial compensation in this regard," said Tvrdík to Seznam Zprávy.
In the leaked recordings, Nezmar unrestrainedly insults some of Slavia's former black players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was sparked by a police raid in mid-October last year at several locations, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The highest-ranking figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football role.
In mid-January, just like former Vyšehrad sports director Rogoz, he was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and BVPs are larping the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but basically of a worse type (the gunners have to fire from a pancéřovaná kabina and carry the shells manually without protection).
Cars - Toyota Hi-Lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, and it has already been possible to get rid of Praga V3S even among specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - good, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and small types with no combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we make them and export them abroad)
PVO: medium - Cold War, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
There were nutria in the river and they were damaging the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped it would go away before anything came out, but of course the fox came out soon after.
I let her come in at 40 meters before I decide to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit his pants, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before I got off the saddle, it was all over.
In other words, a man's lawn can be a pr*ser.
On the other hand, it is not a war, it would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen by thermal imaging, which is available to almost everyone today.
So, you put your expensive things on the visible place, put your feet in the sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Interior found respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state agency responsible for purchasing and distributing masks, respirators and other protective gear for professions most exposed to the coronavirus has spent billions of crowns in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the prices for respirators varied by hundreds of crowns from one day to the next.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others cost more?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Dominika Kubištová, the editor of the iRozhlas server.
I respect soldiers and the army, but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of equipment for the trained to use, we don't even have modern equipment for the current professionals, and modern equipment is becoming more and more complicated, so the skills of the reservists will be rapidly declining over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And in the end, militia/territorial defense is of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrilla and it is also an inevitable necessity to intimidate the enemy.
Only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity will guerilla warfare become irrelevant, and we do not have the geography for that.
We don't have any individual skills.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
Such a situation arises that you look like a cool guy, who 2 minutes ago missed an empty goal, and you drive into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss players and say to yourself, "come on, and what do you think is going to happen now?"
Of course they will take him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to pull the defender" is so bad that I'm honestly surprised when I see that our attacker managed to beat one player from the opponent's team.
The first swallows
The COVID-19 pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major changes in the coming weeks.
The pressure on hospitals is expected to remain for some time according to the statistical models, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta variant.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired before the disease can help against it.
This week, however, an unexpected phenomenon has entered the equation on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new antiviral drug molnupiravir has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and hospitalization by a third and can be used at home.
Paxlovid, a drug from Pfizer, is also expected to be available soon, with a reported success rate of 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of useful tools in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the administration is prepared for the arrival of new drugs.
As has been said, the first to reach Czech patients will be molnupiravir from Merck.
The company was the first to finish the trial because it began developing the drug long before the current pandemic to find a suitable treatment for equine viral infections in South America.
In these studies, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and less willing to share their opinions.
On the other hand, the Eastern Europeans, and especially the Czechs, are used to saying "as much as the beak grew."
You do a survey asking people if they like Muslims.
In Czech, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they will tell you that they love immigration, that everyone should help them, and that we, the Czechs, are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and a media lynching.
And in the polls it looks good, the West is good, the East is bad.
But will they really find out what people are thinking?
Just in France, Le Pen and Zemmour are polling at over 20%.
We even know that there are three of them and they are completely identical.
Due to the rotation of units, so that the soldiers do not have to relearn where everything is, all the buildings are exactly the same.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
It's funny that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or for the speed of deployment of warheads due to the western location.
In the underground bunkers (there are two in each maple tree), only the warheads were stored, not the entire missile.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit would arrive to pick up the warhead and mount it onto some kind of carrier.
In addition to the museum's maple, the others are in a deplorable state.
At the secondary school, we had a classmate Cigán, we were with him for 4 years.
He was fine, he was making good jokes, he was overacting a bit, but he was our mascot.
Everyone liked him, he often came and wanted to explain something, he was missing very little, he came regularly, he was engaged in sports with us, he did not steal snacks or phones, he came cleanly dressed.
He also went on school trips, did all sorts of monkey business, but he was fine, I don't think he ever had any problems.
In the 8th or 9th grade, the siblings and the Roma entered the same class.
Soon after, they beat up a teacher, the police were often called there, they threatened and intimidated other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something on an ad (old things, things I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to the Gypsies, they always had the money, they did not try to pull me on the price, the communication was calm.
Even I have sold a car this way, the guy called me after a month to say that he had already changed the ownership.
I myself say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other color, as long as he behaves in a decent manner (works, functions, does not beat women, in other words, normal behavior).
But if someone comes, stretches out their hand, squats in apartments and houses, only mess is around them, they cause problems... it doesn't matter what color they have, but I will not like it.
I don't have a problem with African migrants as long as they integrate, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in the Písek region
A young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts died at the scene, said Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for the South Bohemian emergency medical services.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably travelling from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov when he lost control of his vehicle in a bend and ended up travelling in the wrong direction.
The Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof on the side of the road after a collision with a Skoda Octavia, according to a spokesperson for the South Bohemian Police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was trapped in the vehicle.
After being rescued, he had to receive emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to a hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, said Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second vehicle sustained minor injuries to his chest and was taken to hospital.
For packages from non-EU countries, new rules apply, customers often do not provide the necessary information
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
“Usually it can be in the dozens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it still makes sense to import from Japan, where postage is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive for him, he now has to add VAT and pass on the data for customs clearance to the post office.
He receives an email informing him that customs expects the package to arrive.
Then all you have to do is fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT was not included in the purchase price by the seller, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and shipping.
In the event that the recipient does not take care of customs procedures himself, the total amount must be increased by the shipping company's fee.
However, according to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, upload two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all deliveries, however, go smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the number of parcels received from abroad at the international post office in Prague has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000 per day.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests to provide information that is necessary to complete customs procedures.
Currently, there are 30,000 parcels on the international post that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information they need and did it on time, we would be about halfway here, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Solution to inflation
See the title, how would you suggest a solution to the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to grow further.
What should the state do, in your opinion, to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, the reduction of VAT on food and fuel in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where things are heading?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford everyday things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, added (who is an employee)?
This year they gave me a 2% increase in gross, which is a slap in the face, but fortunately I have a similar income from my business, which I run while employed.
Could someone please explain to me why proven violent offenders are sent to prison for only six months?
This just doesn't make sense to me, how can a court sentence an animal to only six months behind bars just so it can do it all over again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing in comparison to the fact that their victim will have trauma for years, it will negatively affect their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
And that's not even mentioning the fact that the victim of rape may never recover from that.
Won't this also deter potential future victims from coming forward?
Man from Hrob killed his girlfriend in Kostomlat
The man from Hrob unintentionally helped the police to apprehend his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was issued a warrant for her arrest.
He summoned her himself.
But he went about it in a roundabout way.
He first approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
The guards arrived at the scene after being called to the emergency line and could not believe their ears when the alleged "robbed" person told them that he had made it all up so that the guards would come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to know how to file a complaint with the Police of the Czech Republic.
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the police officers found out that the woman is on the wanted persons list and that there is a nationwide search for her.
Therefore, the case is being handled by the police.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I believe that Slavs are culturally and ethnically long gone, but I would like to hear your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, it's a shame that Churchill did not manage to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA:')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it might potentially be beneficial.
I personally would not consider that to be true faith.
I here I cannot agree with Pascale, there are estimated to be around ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a person then choose?
I'd say it's pretty likely that in some of those thousands of religions, there is at least one god who will punish you for believing in a different god.
After all, even in the Ten Commandments it says that there is no other god but Yahweh.
Wouldn't it then be more rational to refrain from believing in any god at all than to risk picking the wrong one out of all those thousands and ending up in hell or some other such place?
Others: Voluntary training with subsequent placement in the reserve.
The Swiss model is probably similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months in one) and under the supervision of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All branches of the AČR would benefit from something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the Military University.
We can talk like this: There is always talk of cooperation between the educational sector and industry, companies are fishing in schools, and there is some kind of overlap, where the workforce is migrating from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is constantly going on, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
There should also be a cross-over between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that this country will never be invaded by Russians, Germans or Mongolian marauders.
I find it amusing that you consider NATO to be carved in stone, we have allies and they will protect us if things go wrong.
Don't make me angry.
All it takes is one election in the US and their budget will be slashed, and NATO will go down the drain.
The English will exchange us for Russian rubles, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they are satisfied with showing their backs and taking what they want.
The only long-term guarantee of independence is a well-armed military and a population that knows how to use the military technology of its time.
Today, every teenager can pilot remotely controlled devices, so why not?
We don't need a border fortification, that's obsolete today, but a rebellious teenager with a remote-controlled device will be able to handle it.
How to drown in a box tsunami
You unwrap presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're surrounded by boxes and packing materials?
This "waste" is being reused by e-shops that are running out of packaging materials.
As a result, a map was created of shops that will welcome your used boxes.
Not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as one-time waste.
Anyone can bring in cardboard boxes (there are nearly 150 of them on the KAMsNIM.cz map of participating businesses) or plastic or paper fillers.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created, and avoid overcrowded blue bins.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply, as well as the saved money, since the cardboard packaging has increased in price by 50 % over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, this also strengthens my brand.
One such business is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-friendly cleaning products and cosmetics.
Boxes and packing material are delivered to Popůvky near Brno by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we also receive calls from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of cardboard boxes.
All of this will be used when packing parcels from our online shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application also shows the collection points for packaging waste.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of something (where to dispose of household waste, where to hand in expired medicines, tyres, old electrical appliances, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All waste can end up in the right place, and reusable items can find a second home.
In total, the map of the project contains more than 100,000 such places.
“Over time, more and more recycling points, re-use centers, textile bins, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs, and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste are being added to the app”, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the Ukliďme Česko association.
Rather, it seems to me that in today's world, technology is so simple and user-friendly that children who use a computer or a phone to play games do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (especially in English articles) that students at universities do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps for photos, or generally mobile phones in general, they hide the underlying file system with folders and put everything on one screen in the app.
It's fine if they use the technique from childhood, but they should learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU, which begins in January, and it was grandiose.
Macron spoke for an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they cannot be completed in half a year.
French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters agree on little, but on Europe they are united.
And in France, there will be presidential elections in April.
The electoral calendar has also affected the priorities.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and that France is ready to create the conditions for such work of historians.
A number of commentators were quick to criticize Macron, saying that he was engaging in pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Eric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is having some success with this among the French.
Let's take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what's going on in France.
Wouldn't that be enough?
Students in European countries are often taught history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
However, if they do not have an enlightened teacher, they will not know the wider context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for best director and best actress, Jasna Đuričić.
This year at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, he was at the top of the viewer rankings.
The best actor award in Berlin went to Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being under the weather" for a few days I had diarrhea and didn't feel like smoking...
It was worse than a regular flu.
I with the flu, I don't have diarrhea.
This is just my personal experience. I'm not saying that it's the same for everyone.
Christmas Book Recommendations
The Christmas double issue, which will be published on 20 December, will include the traditional literary supplement.
Along with it, there will also be cultural tips.
As a bonus to this digital release, we are including the booklet with you, our subscribers, so that you have enough time to order the books as Christmas presents.
Prose texts that follow the previous similar collection by Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another dose of observation of the world and description of everyday things with extraordinary poetic awareness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second novel, photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of small-town life and Czech society.
The story of a return to the roots, which turns out to be nothing more than a longed-for illusion.
A bohemist and comparatist transfers the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood to the setting of a contemporary village.
Its presentation of brutality surpasses folk versions and culminates in a horror of emotional emptiness.
And about the fact that the way back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit
The author tells a less sentimental story about the return from emigration in his last novel than we are used to.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a life together.
Trains are running according to the new timetable, in some places the carriers have changed
From Sunday, trains will be running according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some routes, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where České dráhy are replaced by RegioJet.
For most routes, only the departure time is adjusted, or the route is slightly altered.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Transport companies started selling tickets during the autumn.
České dráhy plan to run an average of 6,783 passenger trains per day, with an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections within the new timetable, trains will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new timetable, will introduce dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run between Prague and Cheb.
Another new trains of the operator will run in the north of Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The operator will also traditionally increase fares from next year, by an average of 3.2 per cent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The transport company will replace České dráhy here, following the success of the Ministry of Transport's competition.
Daily, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains, eight in each direction.
Changes also affect long-distance trains between Prague and Brno, which will stop at stations Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express kept its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also the weekend connection to Krakow.
According to the spokesperson Emil Sedlář, the carrier tried to keep the timetables of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned maintenance work.
The operation of Arriva trains and those of other operators should continue without major changes.
The operator will also change on some regional routes.
Changes await travellers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk will be operated by Trilex trains from the German company Die Länderbahn.
Passengers will also be able to use a single ticket for rail travel for the second year in a row.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will be increased by 3.2 per cent due to inflation.
I must disagree.
Shouldn't we learn the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and how they had to work hard, how they died.
In my life, I have never heard a sermon from the point of view of the slaveholding side or from that time, no one is defending that, they are just condemning it.
Nobody will tell you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by other blacks and that they were often the worst slave owners.
Nobody will teach you at school that the colonizers often bought the land from the Indians, they will only tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, exterminated them, but they were killing each other long before us.
I I have spent some time in the USA, at schools, both in the north and in the south.
I have never heard of anyone deliberately suppressing facts, but I have heard that it happens, and I think it is a problem (for example, in Japan, the atrocities of WWII are taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white, and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not concerned with people's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the facts of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do it again.
By the way, when we're talking about Southern states, yes, the confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, but they also had some of their own successes, and it seemed absurd to me to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North wasn't much better than it is today, when many people idealize it.
A lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner, and a lot of things also bothered them.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, they lie and manipulate, and, for example, our point of view does not exist (there was a TV video where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What struck me as ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and idealization of communism, something their country never experienced.
In general, it seemed to me that at some universities it was terrible, those students were quite radicalized and those universities often supported them.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, it makes me a bit sad to think that this could be the voice of the majority, because there are so many young people and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has already achieved what it wanted to achieve, and it is no longer about the same thing. It has become radicalized.
At present, those who call themselves feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, and this leads to radicalization on the other side, which often leads to opposition even to quite reasonable things.
Furthermore, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, at the end of the day, I haven't come across anyone who has condemned me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered bad geography, which was a two-way street.
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Furthermore, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If anything connects me to people, it's interests, views of the world, and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than about politics, but then he always comes up with some bullshit about the coronavirus, that everyone is ashamed of.
Of course, there is the Czechoslovak Church of the Brethren.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born out of Catholic modernism and are de facto Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics but go to the Hussite services because it is theologically very similar, but the members are generally more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael on Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans, and every Sunday at 3 p.m. they hold a mass in Latin, as was done before the Second Vatican Council.
The Flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts, however, did not go to Vienna this time either due to the coronavirus pandemic. They picked him up from his Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal - Břeclav in the morning.
They handed it over to the border guards last year as well.
Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate in every year, and I am looking forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to be chosen, said the scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the border crossing Mikulov-Drasenhofen directly on the border bridge, this year it took place at the border crossing Reintal-Břeclav on the car park.
Usually, however, the scouts travel by train to Vienna.
Nothing changes in the delivery of the candle flame across the Czech Republic.
The scouts traditionally travel by train first to Brno, where they will hand over the Bethlehem light to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The distribution of light will be taken care of on Saturday 18 December by the scout couriers, who will be travelling on selected express trains as well as on local trains.
From there, the light will be taken over by local scouts or volunteers, who will then spread the flame across the Czech Republic, even to places where the tracks do not go.
This year, scouts must follow the current measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
It's similar to last year.
We are giving recommendations to the courier teams as well as to the organizers of local events to, of course, wear masks, try to keep a distance, there should be as few of them as possible, not to sing to their colleagues, in short, to behave in such a way that it is as safe as possible, explained Zuzana Hrbková, the spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Christmas light, which travels across Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and harmony at the same time as the flame.
The Bethlehem Candle is a symbol of hope, light that overcomes darkness, for believers.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been spreading it for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All information, including a list of places where people can come to pick up a candle, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics education, so I don't know the basics of economics that prove that subsidies are a cancer on the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole are a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education will make good use of these funds, I just don't understand why these funds are going to agriculture, industry and, in general, to companies.
As mentioned, it produces a superfluous product and disrupts the free market and "the natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million plaques saying "XY is financed/co-financed by the XY project" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the braking of the development when this company stays as it is and takes away orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its bankruptcy.
Absolutely, it's terrible.
Sometimes even someone who was born in the Internet age gets caught in a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that online advertisements don't move with me, but then I get caught out that they have influenced me - it's just so cleverly done that you can't avoid it.
For this reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, in the words of the classic - I would ban the internet.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that the majority believes in and makes sense, I am not a sheep, I would rather believe something that is less likely to make sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion about which I will insist that it is critical thinking"
2. "of course I won't believe everything the media say"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television follows the trend of Christmas films, this year there will be two hundred of them
Los Angeles – Kina, televizní stanice and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas films and this year will premiere more than two hundred of them to their viewers.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been gaining in popularity in recent years, which is why there are more and more of these films being made.
This year, four times as many Christmas films have been made as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database, however, included only those films with the word Christmas (Christmas) in their title, so the actual number of Christmas-themed films is much higher.
Films traditionally associated with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated above all with fairy tales, and worldwide, films such as Home Alone, Love Actually or the classic Christmas story It's a Wonderful Life from 1946 are popular.
However, the real boom in Christmas films did not start until 2009, when the American cable television channel Hallmark launched a special film series, recalled the BBC website.
Her Christmas project Countdown to Christmas (Odpočítávání do Vánoc) at the time included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began to prepare its viewers for Christmas as early as October 22, and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitor Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its schedule this year, with popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contributing to the overall total.
“In this magical season, the story doesn't really matter, what's important is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," said Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (Na vánoční filmy budu doma).
“For the audience, it’s a form of escapism and a way to feel a little bit of calm in the midst of all this festive madness and the madness of the world we’ve been living in for the last few years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, the Hallmark Channel uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there is a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which is resolved successfully and the two people kiss.
That's the way it goes, and as long as all the movies look the same and have the same atmosphere, people are going to watch them one after the other, Gray concludes.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not participate in the final Formula 1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not participate in the final race of the season.
The Haas team will only send one car to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was aiming for a better result than 20th place, which he qualified for.
Russian driver Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was, after all, tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will line up on the grid, with Mick Schumacher's Haas teammate Nikita Mazepin starting from the back of the grid. The first driver to take to the track will be Max Verstappen, who will go head-to-head with Lewis Hamilton in a battle for the title.
Mazepin is reportedly in good health and is not showing any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will be following the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with the safety of all parties involved being the final priority," her representatives told Formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
A potential replacement would have to run qualifying or a race on a different part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not affected by COVID-19.
At the start of the just-concluded season, Kimi Räikkönen tested positive for COVID-19, while Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.

According to the law, COVID is on the list of infectious diseases.
That is, in the same category as HIV, the plague, hepatitis, or typhus.

The perpetrator will be punished with imprisonment for two years to eight years by deprivation of liberty.
c) if he commits such an act in breach of a duty resulting from his employment, profession, position or function, or one imposed on him by law.
d) causing grievous bodily harm.
(3) The perpetrator will be punished by deprivation of liberty for three years to ten years, if the perpetrator caused serious injury to at least two persons or death by the act mentioned in paragraph 1.
(4) Imprisonment for five to twelve years will be imposed on the perpetrator, if he caused the death of at least two persons by the act mentioned in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!
It's a bit like a portable jewellery shop and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, at home we never wore sweaters,“ admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours working on his project.
He bought the silk in Italy, the 24-carat gold thread in France, and the 2,000 crystals from the Swarowski company.
The silver stars were then adorned with 150 diamonds.
The base is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater a softness, says the creator, who does not recommend washing it.
And there's a catch.
“I’m completely broke, I have to sell my sweater as soon as possible,” admits Liban.
If successful, it will set a world record.
The previous most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 Czech crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Soldiers, scouts and drone pilots could deploy before Christmas, the mission has been approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO in connection with several months of actions by the Belarussian regime, which has invited citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of easily crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Mutation of Omikron is spreading in the South Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
Currently, we have reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov has not been proven," said Ciupek.
In the past week, six cases have been reported in the region.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - this is being done by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses at the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She added that it was two nurses from the same workplace of the Brno General Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils from ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, while four have no symptoms.
No one suspected of Omikron traveled abroad
None of the people listed traveled abroad, nor did anyone in their families, and there was no contact with anyone who had been abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship, Ciupek said.
The chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously said that an international water polo tournament in Brno a few weeks ago was being investigated.
There were also players from South Africa and one Belgian player contracted the disease after returning home.
California limits gun sales.
He wants to follow Texas' lead on abortion bans.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain firearms in the nation's most populous state using the legal mechanism Texas used in its controversial abortion law that bans the procedure after detection of a fetal heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation if they sue anyone in California who manufactures or sells assault weapons or homemade firearms.
Newsom's announcement was a response to Friday's ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld Texas' abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to an abortion nationwide until about 24 weeks of pregnancy.
However, the court is now not ruling on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue that arises from the innovative construction of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban, however, was transferred to the public, thus preventing the Texas Republicans from attacking it through the usual judicial channels.
I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) ruling by the United States Supreme Court, which upheld the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely endorsed Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
“If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, California will use this power to protect human life,” Newsom continued.
He instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice to take measures that would allow representatives of the public to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
This term is used to describe homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants to give "private citizens" the right to seek compensation of at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and legal fees from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault weapons, ghost guns or kits to make them in California.
“If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that’s exactly what we should do,” said California’s governor.
The Associated Press notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the state's ban as unconstitutional in June.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas model, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion on Friday's majority ruling warned against the expansion of that legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas an absolute immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against certain Texas officials.
Every emergency vaccination has a public testing phase, during which the vaccination scheme is gradually worked out and the vaccines are improved on the basis of the results.
For example, from Israel there is already a flood of studies on the effects of 4 doses.
According to these studies, the level of antibodies increases by a factor of five in most patients, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccine, it will eventually have its own vaccination schedule, but it's too early for that.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine, based on inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness, will be launched on the market.

Poland threatens to stop payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting against the law if it used its new powers and stopped paying money to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to spend 36 billion euros from the EU's recovery fund to revive the economy hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it's under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use the mechanism that allows for the withholding of EU funds from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
“Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity,” said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its slim majority in the Sejm.
Poland should also consider its commitments to the EU's energy and climate policies, which have led to a drastic increase in energy prices, Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified given that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, which we also contribute to, added the Polish minister.
Its stance on the EU is more radical than that of the governing Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that took place in the Polish judiciary under Ziobro's leadership threaten the independence of the judiciary and put it at the mercy of politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is setting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not a legal state, but changing the government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing a "political dictatorship imposed by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept concessions from Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
“We will never agree that Poland should be a colony,” he said.
But how do you know what's what? In Lidl, for example, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yogurt more than once, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy aisle, I gave up and asked.
They did have it, that's true, in that narrow sector there were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I avoid it, I won't even smell like a market, whether it's an event or not, a golden shop on the square, they may not have such a wide selection, but they usually have everything I need, and it's all in order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl so that I can take a holiday.
And I don't care at all.
For the past two years, I've been watching how data is treated here like fertilizer, and most anti-vaxxers are just a little more out of touch than most pro-vaxxers.

I'm sorry for the outburst and I wish you all a nice day.
I as a child, I was punished with a spoon.
It wasn't about the badges, usually it was just that I kept refusing to listen and misbehaving (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a slap (sometimes even after another "catching" with a spoon, she just brought it and put it down so that I could see it).
Only after repeatedly refusing to listen, I got a few slaps on the butt (through clothing).
I personally think that physical punishments (in a reasonable manner and degree) are beneficial, because the child reacts much more to them than to words.
According to me, the most important thing is the part with the warning, because it gives the child a choice whether to disobey and receive the punishment, or to improve and not receive the punishment.
In the end, all I needed was a warning for me to start listening.
Defense of the system
When the significant Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document to which one swears and which one learns about in school, or whether it is a contract that can be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to change them.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the issue.
In recent years, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be changed.
Léta has been tested by events that its creators (among them Vojtěch Cepl) could not have foreseen, such as the behaviour of a directly elected president.
In one thing, however, Cepl was right.
All we know about such documents suggests that political interventions in their texts must be well thought out.
The institute must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to overcoming most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a sort of rule of governance consisting of individual rules that set limits to politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we restrict politics with bans.
At the same time, however, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't discriminate: in FN Brno, several-month-old baby is fighting for its life
Despite the fact that it is known that the coronavirus is milder in children, there are also severe cases, which hospitals are dealing with mainly in recent times.
“We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, it is said to be between 2 and 5 percent compared to adults," said Novinky the head of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesia and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, Petr Dominik.
The course is usually much easier, lighter, and often symptom-free.
But there are children who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we can see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild support.
It takes place at the children's infectious diseases clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with the coronavirus are only in the last few days in the intensive care unit.
Children with post-Covid syndrome were on the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
“There is an increase in children with acute COVID-19 pneumonia, which means pneumonia that requires admission to the intensive care unit,“ he said, adding that this disease affects both adults and adolescents, as well as several-month-old babies.
Children in critical condition due to the coronavirus are also found in hospitals.
At present, a child of several months' or adolescent age is lying in our hospital, said the chief physician.
However, he is happy that in the Children's Hospital of the FN Brno, they have not yet recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, the presence of a psychologist in a children's hospital - not only on the coronavirus ward - is an inseparable part of cooperation.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, like in adults, vaccination also mitigates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome.
“Therefore, the vaccination dose is also recommended for children,” the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on the marked paths.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, outside of the quiet zone in national parks, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the enclosure).
It is forbidden to ski or cycle in the forest outside marked trails anywhere in the country unless you have an exemption (but of course this is not so strictly enforced in national parks).

China is building the impression that it is in control of the outbreak and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression that it has mastered the outbreak and that the authoritarian regime is dealing with the crisis better.
China has launched a health and political offensive.
Just a few months ago, Beijing was under fire for its handling of the outbreak, which turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero new infections.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective gear and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus, for example in the worst-hit Italy.
How to read Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend of a friend and says: hey, do you want an elephant?
I have one and it's great.
The wife is happy, because she mows the lawn, washes the car with the hose, and the kids play with it.
It's just great.
If you want, I can sell you an elephant for 5000 crowns.
Friend: alright, let's do it, it's going to be great...
After some time, they meet again and the one who bought it complains: you fool, what did you sell it for?
The lawn is trampled, there are huge piles of shit everywhere, the car is ruined, the kids are afraid of it, and the wife wants to get a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you're talking badly about the elephant, you won't be able to sell it...
World affairs are controlled by the great powers.
Despite the principle of equality of sovereign states, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, it works on an economic and political level (in selected issues), but there is still no military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will work out.
I that occurred to me, and it is quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I might be a bit of a wordsmith.
All I'm saying is that the ellipse usually encompasses two units at the same level.
I'll use an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it's clear that it's both from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it's not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
In addition, it is based on the fact that the sentence says "all American forces" including their weapons and that I know that the American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad term and does not need to be further specified for American forces.
But again, I'm just being a word nerd:D
Whether it is or not, it is a nonsensical demand

Britain's Vicki Holland tortures monkey kangaroo Milly
Horrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed her down and mocked her.
Holland also fed the orangutan pork, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her true nutritional needs.
A magistrates court in Gwent has banned her from keeping animals for life, according to The Sun.
Experts in primate rehabilitation, who are caring for Milly after her abuse, say they have never seen a monkey as traumatised as her.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The four-times mother pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for a year, at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid community service, a lifetime ban on keeping animals, and ordered to pay court costs equivalent to 12,000 Czech crowns.
Leader of the Small Monkeys team, which rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is doing well, but the rehabilitation will continue."
Milly took a while to get used to people again.
She cringed and hid from everyone she saw and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The opossum refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she has settled down and is happy with her mate, she may still panic at the sight of new people.
Psychological scars from abuse will haunt her forever, Sawyer says.
Milla's abuse came to light after police in Gwent found horrific footage on her phone following a raid on her home as part of a drugs investigation.
You can hear Milly swearing on the footage.
In the next video, you can hear Holland offering the monkey cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Lick my fingers.
In May, along with her partner Russell Cox (43), she pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to supply.
In her house, police found 1600 pounds of cocaine (about 50,000 Czech crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was sentenced to 30 months in prison and Holland was given a 20-month suspended sentence.

Go out on the street and ask random people if they can solve a quadratic equation with certain roots and coefficients.
Everyone goes through it, and the vast majority don't even scratch and tell you they're completely fine.
So what am I supposed to learn?
I am a big fan of general overviews, and the fact of the matter is that people don't want and don't need them.
And at that point it's pointless and you're never going to get it into them.
Partially, it's for all those people who will need that thing in the future.
But as for the comment that you don't need all this stuff when you're standing at the machine, I meant it completely seriously... ...because you really don't need it.
Moreover, we are slowly approaching a time when not knowing is a punk attitude.
However, the price of the fact that the machines will be operated by barbarians is just too high.
If the journalists were able to count, the coronavirus would not have reached these proportions.
Marriage at First Sight: War between Kadri and Andrey continues!
This is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave right away," replied Andrea on Instagram Stories to inquisitive fans who wanted to know what had disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to cut off all contact and even block him on social media.
The tension between Kadri and Andre was palpable from the start of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move in with him, at least until she moved back to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she was adamant in her refusal.
As can be seen, their relationship did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack! Kadri was furious in response to Andreino's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's supposed honesty with his ex-wife did not go down well with his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I normally don't comment on such things, and in our family we never really talked about such things.
I want to make it clear that I do not want to evoke any pity.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt someone I love so much, I just can't take it!
I'm sorry that I have to do it this way, but I want to publicly thank my brother Kadri for becoming a man and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was so young.
I more so, when I have to read such inaccurate information, which is probably taken out of context.
I would like everyone to know Kadri the way I do, my family and my close ones, it says in the confession in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the truth and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cchao began his robbery spree at a parking lot in a residential neighborhood, where he attempted to break into several cars.
According to available information, he stole less than 330 Czech crowns from one vehicle.
He then decided to climb up to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas from there.
In one of the security camera footage, he is then seen walking down the street away from the scene of the crime, eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he noticed that the bananas were missing and called the police.
She then detained Cchaa.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob in a drunken state.
The matter is currently under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and tied to the state of emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will be ineffective.
However, the law limits the scope of business
That's not enough for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out for local elections on Saturday
On Saturday, people elected new councils in the villages of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberecko and Rovná in Pelhřimovsko.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the number stipulated by law, or the elected councils collapsed.
A total of 28 seats were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected councillors is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a relatively demanding, but successful year.
In total, there were four new or repeated elections for municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Deputy Director of the Czech Statistical Office Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the epidemic of COVID-19, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel.
The Saturday elections in Komňa, Uherské Hradiště, were won by the Sdružení nezávislých kandidátů, which received 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The candidate of the STAN received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means the gain of two mandates.
Two seats in the municipal council were also won by Občané pro Komňu, who received 18.52 percent of the vote.
The former mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of Soukromníci, was also re-elected.
Komňané – nezávislí kandidáti won one seat in the municipal council.
The turnout was 75.48 percent.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It received 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four of the seven mandates.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates No. 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates No. 2 were elected to the municipal council.
The turnout was 93.62 percent.
Repeat elections in Lužice, Most region, were won by the Lužice and Svinčice Association, led by the mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the vote and, like in 2018, has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second-placed Obec pro lid received 43.27 per cent of the vote and will have three representatives in the municipal council.
The turnout was 76.7 percent.
The elections in Nová Ves in Liberec were won by the independent candidates of Naděje pro Novou Ves before ANO.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 percent of voters cast their ballots, and they won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and increased its share of the vote compared to the regular elections in 2018, gaining one mandate and having three.
The turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the results of the elections.
They will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all of this that people are writing here.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to argue with.
If not, it's sad.
I am not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
Even I like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal to look good).
And I don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I don't like how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it made, how it suppressed science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she started, such as the Thirty Years' War
TL;DR: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do with each other
The man fell head first from 12 metres.
The impact on the concrete survived.
A man survived an incredible fall on Sunday night in Ostrava, where he was rescued by emergency medical services of the Moravian-Silesian Rescue Service.
Staff at the regional emergency call centre received the emergency call at 1:00 a.m. on Saturday with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Immediately, two ambulance crews from the ZZS - a medical and a paramedic crew - were dispatched to the scene.
When paramedics arrived at the scene, they found that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a height of around twelve metres and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal hit Vítkovice.
But not in the way it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the emergency services, the man was in a coma, with multiple injuries and in imminent danger of death.
The attending physician intubated his airways, provided artificial ventilation, and after further measures of pre-hospital emergency care, transported him in an ambulance to further care at the trauma center in Ostrava, informed the spokesperson of the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities than about the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and civil servants, but the first line of defense against the infection is the doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendární Nunesová po sedmi letech padla, Oliveira obhájil pás
MMA had a great night with a lot of interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to defeat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had been unbeaten for seven years.
Charles Oliveira in the lightweight division did not hesitate, he showed a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Victory also went to Kai Kara-France, who quickly knocked out Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
He also defeated Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
The women's bantamweight bout between Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña was the main event.
The American entered the match as the "dwarf," as Nunes had not lost in seven years and was looking for another victory.
The start of the duel was also in line with the paper predictions.
Nunes started the fight very aggressively, pushing her opponent to the ground with a push kick.
Penová, however, did not allow herself to make any more mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack with a hook on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both fighters unleashed a plethora of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
Penová also took Nunes to the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to abandon her efforts and wipe out the attack.
The American thus prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the evening was the fight between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier had the better of it, but the tide began to turn.
In the second round, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to take down his opponent with a takedown.
He didn't do too well, but then he created a lot of pressure, got the opponent on his back, and showered him with a series of blows.
This allowed him to win the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier initially resisted, but eventually had to tap out.
The Brazilian then defended his title, while Poirier lost for the second time in two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley secured an emphatic victory, knocking out Raulian Paiva with a hard right hook in the first round.
He then knocked him out with a series of precise blows and recorded his fifteenth victory.
Kara-France then dealt with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes won another victory with her little daughter, but now, after seven years, she lost.
The knee, or the knee?
At first glance, it doesn't look like much.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is easy to determine whether they are masculine, feminine, or neuter.
However, there is also a fairly large group of nouns where the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
In the case of declension, they acquire double consonants and in some cases remain in the unchanged form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kýčle" are masculine and feminine, in the first one they are declined according to the pattern "stroj", and in the second according to the pattern "píseň".
Another group of substantives have different forms in the first person plural, for example: "row/row", "turnip/turnip" or "potato/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are grammatically correct, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some words may vary regionally, such as "cucumber" in the Czech Republic and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is nonstandard, as are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch," "waffle" and "waffle," etc.
Some words that entered the Czech language from other languages were originally uninflected, but they eventually acquired Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained in the neuter gender, but with masculine endings.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to enter Europe.
How is the situation directly on the Greek border?
Tensions are rising along the Greek-Turkish border as an increasing number of migrants attempt to make their way further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to move towards the Schengen area's southern border after Ankara stopped protecting them.
European politicians promise Greece support, humanitarian aid is also being prepared by the Czech government.
What exactly motivates refugees to embark on this uncertain journey?
And how is the situation on the ground?
For three months we haven't seen blue sky and we're suffocating, says Sydney journalist
Deadly fires, which have plagued Australia for four months, have killed nearly 30 people and hundreds of millions of animals and scorched millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the local population coping with the disaster?
Could the Morrison government have done more to mitigate the impact of the drought?
And what will the country have to prepare for in terms of climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Sydney-based journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and will always be rare.
Therefore, it is written about everyone everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to talk about how prevalent sexual violence is in our society and how horrific it is, so they try to sweep it under the rug.
I don't know anyone who has been falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how often the people around them or the police treat them.
Victims should always be believed.
The trend is that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But it's still something that a lot of people keep to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse others.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual assault, but by spreading the idea that "a lot of the accusations are false" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sex offenders.
Czechia is flooded with unfinished houses, families don't have money to finish them
The price of building materials has risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people found themselves in a precarious situation as a result.
She does not have the means to complete the unfinished family homes, and the banks are refusing to increase her mortgage loans.
Besides the price of materials, the price of construction work is also increasing.
As a result, people don't have enough money to finish building their family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case scenario, people move into unfinished and unlicensed houses.
In the worst case, unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford the mortgage and rent at the same time," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We will build two to three family houses a year, and in 50 per cent of cases it has happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult because we have to comply with certain things in the contract, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we're working for free," said the owner of the construction company, Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they were counting on the house costing five million, now it's going to cost seven.
I some will be waiting," Slivoň added.
The price of copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment has risen the most from the material.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labour.
There is a shortage of graduates in construction-related fields in the Czech Republic, and the influx of foreign workers is being slowed down by the pandemic.
Currently, only the situation regarding the issuing of building permits is more favourable.
„In October, construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,“ Křeček added.
We're doing well and we're going to do even better.
Real visions, however, are lacking, says a commentator for ČRo - mujRozhlas
The start of the new year was traditionally accompanied by the speeches of politicians, in addition to the traditional celebrations.
Besides the Prime Minister and the leader of ANO, Andrej Babiš, and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
As far as I'm concerned, the diploma thesis is super, I have my own topic, which I chose, I build on the bachelor's thesis, I always work on it for a whole year and then write the written part within a week or two.
State exams are completely calm in the Czech Republic, as long as the person is not a total monkey and something remains in his head, the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate him with theory.
I for example, I studied for the state exams for a week, and when I was in the end, the commission always tried to guide me to some logical deduction, which I had right away.
Otherwise, to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we've done this a lot, it's really useful, they learn a lot).
I think it's great that at the end of the course there is an exam that reflects the knowledge gained during the project, not just a defense.
Everything's fine, but don't clog up e-mail and phone lines and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same shit as them.
Those people at the embassy have nothing to do with that.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But feel free to put a statue of Putin next to a statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe give it to Xi Jinping so that it touches his butt or something like that.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing a spanner in the works for artists.
If you don't post stories every day and at least every second day a new picture, your reach will decrease to a minimum.
And it keeps changing what it thinks is more important, whether it's likes, comments or saves.
I'm really pissed off lately, so maybe I'll have to resort to TikTok, where a lot of artists in my field are having a lot of success, and they can't get enough of it.
In the end, I might even be happy if something more user-friendly comes along, something that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists
Statement of the Donetsk Workers' Party
Union - yes, breakup - no, they express their opinion against the breakup of the USSR.
30 years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind occurred.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an openly benevolent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard to the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceased to exist."
One stroke of the pen "annihilated" a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
The dissolution of the USSR resulted in tens of millions of ethnic Russians living abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both World Wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built up over the previous 70 years by sitting in Belovezhskaya Pushcha betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously deindustrialized, slowed down agriculture, detached from the world's greatest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically connected in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the rise in crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO's expansion to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender first to the socialist camp, and then to the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "vacuum of power".
Everything that was betrayed and abandoned in haste was quickly filled and occupied by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I I'll buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce the price to 99 CZK / kg - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat, by changing its price, becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I'll wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg - how is this meat different from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for three days?
I will answer myself - nothing.
These things about how if something is cheap, it must be bad, rotten, or low quality are so retarded, I have to tell you the truth.
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass, girls were distributing some brochures, similar things I always take with me to help out the brigadiers, they can't throw it away...
No, the pamphlet was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I knew it was some sort of propaganda.
After reading it, I found out who published it and in the end it turned out to be Scientology.
No, it was a good matroš, full of completely useless advice, like I should wash myself and not be a pičus.
It's a pity, because of this, the forests would not have to be cut down.
Something similar happened to me with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to do what that person wants, even if you don't realize how bad the situation is.
She has threatened me several times that she will hurt me because I went out with a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and begged me not to leave.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she started to get on my nerves.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up with her, but I lied to her and said that we could talk about it next week to calm her down and prevent her from getting upset again.
Such a person will suck out your feelings, emotions, and overall joy.
Better to keep your distance
When the insurance companies are frantically looting here by buying up all the tests and hunting down the positives, who would even know about this horrible disease if it weren't for the tests.
The only thing we've achieved is to complicate the lives of companies, transport companies and others, because their employees have been sentenced to five days of home detention by the random number generator.
In the West, they have already stopped with this nonsense and have come to the conclusion that it is pointless to deal with an illness that is weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to steal something and boost his ego by inventing penalties.
It looks like the old good scammer is back again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is again on the rise.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a first-year student at university), the initial promises of training in products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't need to know that, just get people".
Honestly, I was interested in the products I was selling because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about scaring people into buying.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you wanted to make money, you had to sell a few sure-fire products every month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable things, so I felt like a door-to-door salesman for pots and pans.
What I can say, however, is that the experience was valuable, and I learned that one should not jump on every bandwagon and verify information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't want to lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even do some good, but they are not going to brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't seen many of these things.
HR is relaxed, managers are managing managers, and they're not sticking their noses in our business.
Regular assessment does happen, in the form of what we do here (set some goals for the next year, look back a year later to see what worked and what didn't) - it's more self-assessment than being graded by someone based on numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also not mandatory.
But we are also somewhat unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes it feels like we're a sort of startup that's squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it doesn't bother us too much as long as the results are good.
The missing Czech in the UK is dead.
Her body was found in London.
The British police have been searching for a 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November without success for almost ten days.
On Sunday, December 12, the outgoing Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherský Brod had been found dead.
The British police confirmed to our embassy in London today in the afternoon that they found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not be releasing any further information on the case.
My express our sincere condolences, said Kulhánek on Twitter.
The last time anyone saw the young woman was on 28 November, when she was travelling in a bus on her way home from work. Before getting on the bus, she withdrew money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by her co-workers five days later.
Following her disappearance, London police began searching for her, and Interpol placed her on its list of missing persons worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech missing persons database.
Police have already arrested one man in connection with the incident in recent days.
What role he played in the case and what he is suspected of, but did not reveal.
Four municipalities get new councils at the end of the year
On Saturday 11 December, new councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in Uherské Hradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the number stipulated by law, or the elected councils collapsed.
There were 99 valid candidates for the 28 seats in the new elections.
The turnout was 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters cast their ballot.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the municipal councils in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men competing for 28 council seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a relatively demanding, but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections for municipal councils and, above all, the very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work in difficult epidemiological conditions, which put greater demands on the equipment and personnel, Eva Krumpová, 1st Deputy Chairman of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the results of the vote and, after approval, they will be published in the Official Gazette.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to get used to the fact that we have a pretty dangerous infectious disease here.
It's taken me a long time to come to terms with the fact that a large part of the population, across all its strata, treats it like an idiot.
I'm looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because then I'll finally be less dependent on the fact that other people aren't assholes.
He would be stripped of his presidential powers and his ability to regain them.
However, the chances of this actually happening are very small, as others have mentioned.
Furthermore, I am not sure whether it can be considered treason at all.
High treason is an act that endangers the sovereignty, the territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimacy: The number of people under 35 who go without sex for a year is growing
More and more young adults in the United States are living their lives without sex.
It's mainly religious people, according to the Daily Mail website.
The survey found that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who abstain from sex has risen from eight to 21 per cent.
The number of women aged 18 to 35 who said they had not had sex in the past year was higher than ever.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher unemployment rate.
This may also be due to the presence of the media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people.
“Since 2010, the share of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they had no sex in the past year has grown rapidly,” said Lyman Stone, a researcher at the IFS.
Among married people, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% of them saying they had no sex in the last year in 2021.
Among free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also contributed to by the fear of premarital sex and religious upbringing.
Despite the fact that married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under the age of 35 continues to fall.
Young people are divided on the issue of premarital sex, with about 30% believing it to be a bad thing and about 70% believing it to be acceptable.
“It is true that among the unattached in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior is pushing that trend,” Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, religion is the reason.
Since 2008, the proportion of abstinence among free-thinking people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has risen from 20% to almost 60%.
Among "lower believers," the trend rose from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also found that people who are unemployed or have lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which is likely to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, which is replacing this need.
This trend took off mainly during the lockdown of the pandemic of the coronavirus.
The entire vaccine mandate for COVID is about whether a society should force a part of its population to behave in a way they don't want to, but which may save their lives.
It's a fairly difficult question, and I'm most interested in the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't order it and they die, it will be our fault.
My would certainly be able to blame the death of the 80-year-old man, who actually didn't know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't want to get vaccinated, and in the end he caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can be blamed for the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccination, who, together with the SPD and the KSČ, shouts something about persecution and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be clearly deduced that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will be able to blame themselves for it.
Czechia without snow.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent years in the Czech Republic.
The operators of ski resorts cannot do without artificial snow, and the weather complicates, for example, the preparations for the Jizerská 50 cross-country ski race.
Is this a trend or an exception?
What will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about a pimp.
One time our teacher took us all the way across the city to the boatyard so we could go on boats down the river.
On the way there, we walked down a rather wide street once, and we didn't see anyone in the middle - a follower of the Hare Krishna sect.
Naturally, they came down on us.
Fortunately, I managed to escape, but I managed to talk to one of my friends.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I don't have a soul," she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, was laughing all the way to the boatyard.
We are spoiled rotten.
Not much is happening, but the system is collapsing, says Orozovič
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after visiting Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors.
“We are opening a new chapter in our bilateral relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis caused by worrying Russian troop movements near the Ukrainian border, according to the Chancellor, should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the "Normandy group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially created a migrant crisis and uses people as living targets and weapons, as every night we record hundreds of attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
He met with the Chancellor to discuss further sanctions so that Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz told the DPA news agency that Warsaw can count on German support in its dispute with Belarus, and condemned the regime's treatment of refugees as inhumane.
Drunk Polish nun caused accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident a short time later, but it was being driven by another nun who was trying to take the blame.
When the policemen told her that even if she didn't give way to another vehicle and left the scene of the accident, she could lose her driving licence, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into her car and asked for help.
The police then came for Celestina's sister.
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and when they found that she had more than two percent alcohol in her blood, they immediately took her driver's license away from her.
At the same time, they informed her that she would have to confess her crimes in court.
Hugo the dog is doing what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not keep an eye on his film.
Czech creators of family comedies were inspired by American stories about beloved pets.
But they forgot about an important thing: the laws of film craft.
After the kitschy film F. Brabce Gump - pes, který naučil lidi žít, now another film Tady hlídáme my is competing for the audience's emotions in cinemas.
Co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič ml. freely follows up on his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
Hugo the Talking Fox returns, along with some familiar faces around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a pension in the Šumava region that is dying out, so they start to invite dog owners to stay there. Julie's father with his partner and, above all, her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenager who is experiencing her first love.
The director, along with his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer), struggled with the narrative in their previous film, which at least entertained children and the dog.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that elicits a mixture of awe and embarrassment.
Let's recap.
Julie, although a scientist, is susceptible to the superstitious beliefs of childlessness, and when the "constellation" is right, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates indicate - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during a guided tour with a local guide), the retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, and the family takes her to the hospital, so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Šumava forest, with the help of a dog.
Nothing against the healing power of nature and the strength of beloved animals.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the spectator marvels at the amount of nonsense required to convey this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a dog show, a charlatan from the Šumava, policemen arriving on a tip-off to look for "drugs" and discussing the strength of bone meal as fertilizer - and which crazy family stays in the pension, of course, gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a long coma and sits there, made up and smoking a cigarette at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and bacon as a recovered vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
Then the creators explain to the audience that "that sometimes happens after a coma."
Shajmuratov's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build the main dramatic situations, a sense of character, and a sense of the point and the director's leadership.
The acting is uneven, the editing is inept, and the overall impression is sloppy.
While Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to keep their parties under control, they don't have much to play with.
The only redeeming feature of the film are the poetic shots of the Šumava landscape by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot, and doggerel dialogue, let alone popular vulgarities uttered by the characters.
Neither is the fact that the producer has been a member of the Greyhound Breeders' Club for many years.
Good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog must be accompanied by knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This did not work in this case.
There's a bit too much erotica and a lack of feel for the genre for this to be a good family movie.
Even as an advertisement for canine therapy, this amateurish piece of work would not pass muster.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from people like you.
There's a difference between offering and coercing, here you can see how well you understand it, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to kids all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job.
The Middle East is experiencing unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
“Almost complete lack of rainfall in November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual,” the Israel Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term average rainfall for November.
Two-day rainfall this week was more the exception than the rule.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It's also the perfect Christmas backdrop, said Nazareth resident Wasím Aškar.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, is intermittent and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about water resources and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, is full to the brim this spring, thanks to the three rainy winters in a row.
Since then, the level has fallen.
Water managers have been warning about the drought for a long time.
“It is expected that there will be a decrease in rainfall as a result of global warming and climate change,“ said Uri Schor, spokesperson for Israel's Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan are worse off.
The number of fuel tankers on the streets of the Jordanian capital, Amman, is increasing.
Drinking water and private wells are drying up.
“This year, my orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years,” Imád Sulejman, a tanker truck driver, announced in September.
Farmers clash with security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The bed of the local river was completely dry.
The region has seen its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares a military strike against Iran
The Israeli Defense Minister said that the Vienna talks did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington of plans to attack Iran's nuclear facilities.
Defense Minister Benny Gantz on Saturday ordered the Israel Defense Forces to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who is in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but also to inform Washington about the military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and the world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
About 3 years ago, this also happened to me.
I patted her a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what exactly she wanted from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicion of a pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these kind of people, I made the girl feel uncomfortable with my doubts and questions, and then I thanked her and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a crook, but a pyramid is a pyramid and a financial advisor is a financial advisor.
Skiers went to the mountains over the weekend, there was enough snow and good weather
Ski resorts in the Czech Republic saw the first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow, and some ski resorts have opened as a result.
Skiers were not deterred by the obligation to present a covid certificate at ski lifts.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about the lack of customers, some ski rental companies are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people headed to cross-country ski trails and ski slopes in the Liberec region over the weekend.
The skiers were lucky with the weather, which today offered sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend really went well from the very first evening skiing on Friday, when we had the first skiers on the slope,” praised the director of the Ještěd Sporting Area, Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went for the first weekend skiing in the new season also to Jeseníky.
Ski Aréna Karlov and the Branná ski resort in Šumperk were also open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with about 400 people attending on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so it was perfect, said the representative of the ski resort in Branná, Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell a ski pass to people who are vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19.
Except for a few exceptions, people are prepared and are presenting the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the ski centre Špindlerův Mlýn told ČTK.
“We have seen only a handful of incidents,” he added.
Some rental shops and ski equipment stores report lower demand than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is still interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
More pressure is expected during the skiing holidays.
The managing director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, David Šinták, also feels that there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as there was before the pandemic.
At that time, before the pandemic, we were already almost out on loan.
Compared to before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, said ČTK Šinták.
According to him, people have become lazy during the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental company in the Novako area in Boží Dar is experiencing great demand.
They started lending out the skis a week ago, and there is already a waiting list.
We will start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year, said Pavlína Nováková, the owner of the ski resort.
The interest is comparable to the period before the epidemic, according to her, is also about the ski school.
If we want successful and wealthy people not to leave the country, they must be able to live a quality life here as they would in a foreign country.
This certainly does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often difficult to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Intelligent and skilled people are leaving the country, and they don't have any property here.
The owner of the company is not just going to leave the country.
I with the rest, I agree completely.
If these people do not feel good in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future for themselves in the Czech Republic, they will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary started when one fine day Orbán won the election, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is about the elections.
If you live badly here, then a traditional V4 crazy can also win here.
The young and the well-educated will leave, staying will be his supporters and people whose property will not fit into the plane.
Dreadful photo!
Langmajer in the blood because of a bet on beer?
While the autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Island, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor then posted a photo of his bloody face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it acting for the filming?
The London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
“The disappearance of Petra is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare,” said Lucy O'Connor, of the Lambeth police station, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her, and they just want to know where she is,” she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work at around 19:45 on Sunday and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen in a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on December 3.
Srnková, according to British media, worked as a "healthcare assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
“We are deeply concerned for our colleague, Petra, who is missing,“ the group of health facilities said in a tweet.
“We are appealing to anyone who may have any information which could help to locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
The public is also being urged to come forward by Harriet Harman, the MP who raised the case of Srncová at a press conference on Saturday.
“She’s been missing for several days now, she’s only 32, she’s from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably distraught,” the Labour politician said, holding up a photo of the woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel like all of us have an extra responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family, working in our healthcare system,” Harman said.
Police had previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC's news website, however, the police did not provide any information about the man's identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
I I don't underestimate Ukraine.
That's not "huge numbers," but about 8 percent of the Russian military.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly saying that the threat of invasion is being exaggerated and is starting to tire of our presence.
I quoted above.
I don't know how he came to the conclusion that Russia wants a war.
War is hell and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is so many-sided that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex the ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border corresponds to.
Well, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables come into force in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services
Travellers in the Prague Integrated Transport System (PID) will have to get used to some changes from Sunday, affecting mainly suburban services.
New lines were created, some routes changed, and others were discontinued.
Mladoboleslavsko is now integrated into the system.
Since Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice have been stopping at the Zahradní Město station in Prague.
Trains on the S7 line will run from Beroun to Český Brod, passing through Prague's main station.
The recently opened station Prague-Zahradní Město will now be served by the rychlík R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID is now expanding to other areas.
In addition, buses will run to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines that extend into the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be discontinued, 37 new ones will be introduced and the operation of 12 existing ones will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Zličín in Prague and go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection has also been established between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník, which replaces the discontinued train line S53.
Trains will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and on weekends, when a new express line number 404 will depart from Prague to Rakovník.
Links 400 and 410 operating in the Liberec region are now included in the PID system.
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not Holešovice railway station.
Line 400 runs through Mělník, Děčín and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected services continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplementary line 410 runs from Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, operation has been discontinued or limited on ten středočesk local railways, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, there are long-term restrictions on the tracks between Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes are also in store for travellers at other locations.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or the line 420 from Dobříš with a connection to Prague, where PID tickets can be used up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk and the routes of some buses on the border between Central Bohemia and Hořovicko in the Plzeňský kraj have been changed.
Healthy lunch/snack delivered to the office from a supermarket
Hi, I work 9-5 with a 30-minute lunch break, and my only option for food is to go to Billa or a bit further to Lidl.
Given that I have no movement, after work I don't have the strength to exercise, so I have to eat as healthily and dietarily as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and, in a rush, I buy only pizza dough and a yogurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: what healthy foods can I buy in a supermarket that do not need to be cooked?
Not everyone waits for a foot of snow like you do, unfortunately.
It's not about the trees you have to see.
Only the tip of the tree may be hidden under the snow.
If the tree is damaged, it may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I am not saying that it is the only reason why we are not allowed to go off-piste, but it is one of them.
Dara Rolins' confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
The Czech show business pond has been living only by the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd since Friday.
They've been together since the summer, and the famous footballer even divorced his wife because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to fans explaining why she kept her love a secret for so long.
“I allow myself to claim that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would not know that Dara has caught a bear, i.e. pardon, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is madly in love with the most successful Czech football player.
Apparently, it was he who did the packing, not the other way around.
Three days are the focus of attention, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
The thing we didn't look forward to, but knew was going to happen, continues the singer.
I don't know who is worse off.
Whether it's those who don't care at all and it pops up on them even from a can, or us, whose lives are scrutinized in minute detail.
It's as if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match, or if you insisted on everyone knowing your list of ex-partners and being aware of your mistakes.
That's what I like, that's what I want, says Dara.
The couple met in Italy, where Rolins was preparing her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been vice-president of Juventus football club for a long time.
They came out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for the end of Nedvěd's divorce.
His wife, Ivana, has been separated from him for three years, but they have only been legally separated for three weeks.
In any case, we would like to thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
And that's why I love my new man, and I stand by him just like he stands by me, she concluded.
Hey, everyone else has probably already said everything important, but I just want to confirm that the dorms are great for the first semester or two, most of my classmates have made friends and roommates by the end of the first semester or beginning of the second semester, which I think is the best option, because you know who you'll be living with.
Most apartments aren't advertised very far in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but it doesn't hurt to check out the offerings.
Otherwise, avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's not a good address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-friendly, Královo Pole and that way is fine, and it's close to most of the faculties of VUT (I don't know where you're starting).
I never had to look for an apartment, but I am a born Brno native, so I can help you with Brno in general, if you still need some information.
That's an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland decided to do, it's actually okay that the state doesn't provide enough funding for some schools.
Either they can learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or they can follow the state curriculum and pay for it with taxes.
After all, we can't allow a private actor to control a part of the education system just because it adds a few crowns to the state contribution and allows it to teach what it wants in schools.
Such a statement loses a bit of weight when it comes from a person who, two days earlier, expressed themselves in this way about a petition calling for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So, a vote against whether someone should have an abortion is the same as a vote against whether a statue should stand in the square?
I would discuss it with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced that (and even long-term professionals) when cataloging/digitizing, they either throw something at random or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and put a note that it is unreadable.
It's true that in this case it's quite legible, so I wouldn't recommend it.
Personally, I would probably do something like that in a comment, depending on which program you use.
If you want to be a conscientious and diligent student, you can look in some character databases and find the closest one.
However, since it looks like you are drawing from a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol to match what was physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it more Odryska (kingdom) than OdryNska?
PSS: Someone has already figured this out for you.
Check out that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
This is much worse than the fact that they will have interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important approved documents are scrutinized word by word, and a basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, that's the job of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various institutions of the EU, English is more useful to politicians for informal contacts and establishing extra-standard relationships.
In addition, with the English, it's quite interesting, after the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't understand the hate for Cejl.
I for the third year I work there and everything is fine.
I have driven home from work at 10pm and never had a problem.
That it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who hasn't been there in years.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is block the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't:D Definitely not a place where I'm afraid to go out at night.
So, if you're looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the city centre, I'd go for it.
There are many newly renovated or newly built apartments there now.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and Gelemová as a stake in the ground!
Who will you be spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on their Advent wreath. Felix Slováček did not.
I I didn't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I Dáda's wreath I've seen, and Lucie definitely has one, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that she often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda remained alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently, we met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
But we were still talking to each other, so we didn't end up fighting on Christmas.
I don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts throughout the year, and I'm sure I'll buy something for Dáda and Lucie, maybe perfume.
I'm a gentleman, Felix added, who himself came to the premiere of the music video in the Richman club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to talk to, says Slováček, who was glad to meet the wife of Luděk Sobota, Adrian, or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I don't think anyone is going to fight for us, and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot not to take this territory.
And I don't understand why that's a bad argument, can you explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are not enough policemen, and they cannot afford it, so the firefighters and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending Ostrava goes against the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
Czechia is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the amount of water has decreased in mountainous and hilly areas, and the amount of precipitation has also decreased in areas where there was no water shortage before.
The drought affecting large parts of Central Europe is caused by climate change.
However, the impacts are exacerbated by the way in which we manage the land.
How to prepare for the drought?
And how can we help nature in these difficult times?
That's how it's going to be, I can barely stay on my skates on the ice, I know nothing about playing hockey, and the tactics (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also a mess.
Whether you're a "bear Russia" or a "camel China," losing by two goals, even if you don't necessarily have to win the game, is different.
But anyway, what I'm hearing from the Czech commentators, what the referees are paying attention to and what they're not paying attention to, whether it's men's or women's ice hockey, it's all a bit strange, but that's how it is with everything in sport, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And, in my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be the same as always, and that we have lost more often to Russia than we have won, would be a classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
There are 5,766 persons hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people have died in the Czech Republic, with another 74.
The number of confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia surpassed 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases were registered.
It is the lowest daily figure since 13 October.
The total number of registered cases of coronavirus in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing a "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by the Omicron variant, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK Health Security Agency, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be required.
People infected with omicron are already being hospitalised in the UK, and Hopkins expects their numbers to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson probably broke the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last year, when a lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
One of Mr Johnson's ministers defended the quiz as taking place "virtually" over a computer.
However, the event was attended by groups of staff gathered around computers in Downing Street.
There is growing pressure in Britain to remove Johnson from the post of prime minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties in defiance of the lockdown.
British public and media are fuming that Johnson and his government are making a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV's commercial channel in the UK: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
Today morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of Prime Minister.
It's remarkable how quickly events have unfolded.
Want to flip and save your skin?
Hungary will hold elections in the spring, which could end twelve years of rule by Viktor Orbán.
This will be an election of European significance.
How fair can you expect them to be?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because they weren't free in the last two elections under Orbán.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit from it, and does other small or large tricks.
The latest one is that everyone can choose where they want to vote in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to move voters from decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So, I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is quite different.
Previously, the question was not whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will go to the united opposition.
This is a big change for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they try to hold on to power by playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently leaked recordings of László Kövér, the president of the parliament and one of the leaders of the Fidesz party, show him telling the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
These are the signs of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of the new features.
It all starts with the language.
I got beaten up quite a lot, the last time was when I was 14, my mum doesn't have much patience, I don't either, my dad has had it for a long time, but then he explodes (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I used to get very angry as a child, to the extent that I would lie on the floor in convulsions and be completely blue, they had to take me under the shower twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they gave me a slap on the wrist, sometimes it was more that they didn't know what to do.
I now have a tendency to solve things violently, as a child I was quite a fighter, now I at least hit something to vent my frustration, and as a younger person I used to hit my parents on the hand (to avoid getting a slap on the face), so nothing extreme, but I always have the urge to do so.
I don't know to what extent it is due to my explosiveness, but it certainly has something to do with the way I was brought up.
I I am afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and deal with it in the same way.
I think hitting kids is just wrong, and my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not when it wasn't "disciplinary" anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent screws up their kids a bit, so I don't blame them.
I don't feel offended, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed for something.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call those who create laws in such a quality Kundamis.
Otherwise, I would like to know if you are afraid of the loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting your product and buying it, and that you'll have the money to pay your mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia go with the murder of investigative journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial in the case of the quadruple murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kušnírová has begun.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She mobilised civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his links to the top echelons of Slovak politics and justice.
How significant will the process be for Slovakia?
It's the journalists who are to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition received so much more media attention than the counter-petition of deans of all medical faculties, which came out a couple of days later?
No, they were fooled, and the company got away with it.
Deaths on Czech television were still associated with COVID-19 just half a year ago.
Another government is coming to an end and the law on involving municipalities in the selection of a disposal site is nowhere to be seen
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end, and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of local communities and their citizens in the selection and approval of a deep geological repository for high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of the proposal, which was submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after long delays.
However, its content is in serious disagreement not only with the Platform of Municipalities Opposed to Deep Geological Repositories, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The self-governments expect a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers regarding the disposal site, which has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is also stipulated by the Czech nuclear law and the European directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The draft law proposed by Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is criticized by the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the location of a repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a particular location.
This can be achieved by requiring the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to seek the consent of the affected communities before commencing a specific process.
The presented draft of the matter almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities into mere statistics in the permitting procedures.
The draft does not include systemic compensation for municipalities for the entire search and selection process for the site, its approval and operation.
According to today's legal norms, the representatives of the municipalities do not have many opportunities to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a storage site.
Only in certain licensing procedures can they submit their objections or file an appeal, which is decided by the authority or minister in whose interest the licence is to be issued.
Any possible lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the carrying out of surveying or construction work.
The co-determination demanded by Platforma is a principle that is commonly used in many democratic countries and certainly in those that have advanced in the permitting of waste disposal, such as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and is based on contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total sum for these works, according to the register of contracts, amounts to almost 4 million Czech crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson for the Platform Against Deep Geological Repositories of Highly Radioactive Waste said: After the ministers of industry, who have only postponed the balancing of the position of municipalities vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste, we are expecting a significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Association of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which is in line with the position of the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations.
The Platform Against Deep Geological Repositories brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to advocate for a change in the state's approach to dealing with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep geological repositories.
The platform also advocates that the decision on the location for possible disposal should be conditional on the prior agreement of the affected municipalities.
Actor John Goodman (69) lost 90 kg thanks to fear: He slimmed down.
Although he had not felt the need to change his lifestyle for a long time, he was finally scared by the doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He introduced his new character at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
From Roseanne's fat guy, he's a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family had asked him to lose weight because his big body was causing furniture to break.
“I put everything in my mouth,” the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit around, he told ABC's Good Morning America, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on which boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming community, I wouldn't translate it.
If it were, say, a formal text, perhaps I would look for ways to describe or explain the boss more.
There are many different types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls has several bosses, yes, and so "boss" is something like the lord / ruler of a level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are secret bosses (super boss, hidden boss), which are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often much stronger than standard bosses.
And then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are there, but the player doesn't fight them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), so how can they be called bosses at all?
And then there are mini bosses.
You can't really translate boss into a single word in any language, Czech included (interesting is Catalan, which translates boss as the final enemy).
It's just important for the story or the game in general, a computer-controlled opponent that is stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also took part.
British police are looking for Petra Svrnková, who has been missing since December 3.
The Czech police also took part in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherské Hradiště has been missing since 7 December.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
Petra Svrčková was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called red notice for her.
After Petra, the whole world is looking for her.
The Czech police cooperates closely with the British police, said police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
“We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The search for Petra has also appeared on the police website.
He is said to be 168 centimetres tall, slim and has brown eyes and long, straight brown hair.
It should come from Uherský Hradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
The MP for the area, Harriet Harman, has also been involved in the search for Petra.
She took part in hanging up posters with Petra's face on them.
“We are very concerned about her,” she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
However, it is not clear who he is or what he had in common with Petra.
Before Christmas, Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month saw a significant uptick as the end of the year approached.
We noticed a large campaign associated with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is designed to grab the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its name, this time it was called "Copy of invoice for 11,2021...exe," according to Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials and then sends them to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and the beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is again growing.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case did not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November detected more campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October, Formbook has slightly weakened in November, but it is still responsible for almost a fifth of all detections.
Attacks occurred continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10, and 15.
Formbook contained the most frequently a file with the extension .exe named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name invoice is still used.
The attachment in Czech may be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts have noted a significant drop in activity and a decline in activity for the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had a major campaign in the Czech Republic for several months.
This today's demo of the smart guys who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The Prague march was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the river bank and according to my experience, the demonstrator does not seem to be afraid of an estimate of around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the quayside and the bridge, as well as the quayside road.
That means there are a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the march of about 40,000 demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led them to find common ground.
Only anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and co. would be able to fill and pay for such a large parade.
The activities of the association Chcípl pes are gaining popularity, it reminds me of the Million Chvilek for Democracy Upside Down.
I sometimes get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could come out of this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the flow of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not become a four-dose and more.
It certainly won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, count on that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a two-dose vaccine, as it is clear that we will need to be re-vaccinated every six months.
I am very happy that vaccines have saved us.
A brilliant act of scientists, for which humanity is rightly proud.
The end of the shoe, Bulgaria has a new prime minister calling for change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov, leader of the anti-corruption movement We Continue Change, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
It has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government, under pressure from anti-corruption protests, lost the elections.
The victorious anti-graft and anti-corruption parties, however, could not agree on a coalition, so there were two more snap elections.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
From "secretly" recorded footage, a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been missing in London for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was on her way home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, the woman's former employer and the MP for the London constituency she lived in are also calling her.
“The disappearance of Petra is completely out of character and we are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare,” said Lucy O'Connor, of the Lambeth police station, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her, and they just want to know where she is,” she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work at around 19:45 on Sunday and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen in a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on December 3.
Srnková, according to British media, worked as a "healthcare assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
“We are deeply concerned for our colleague, Petra, who is missing,“ the group of health facilities said in a tweet.
“We are appealing to anyone who may have any information which could help to locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
The amateur painter of children's rooms in Šumperk, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also the regional pirate councillor) was denounced anonymously for copyright infringement.
However, the court ruled that Krteček's paintings in Šumperk did not violate the law.
For a month, a hole in the road in the form of a channel without a lid was visible in Ústí nad Labem.
It was a matter of life and death.
The municipality referred the complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate (ŘSD), which owns the road, but it did not react, so the pothole remained.
Finally, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the ŘSD began "intensively addressing the situation".
