Slavia promised Berbrovi a million for the title, Tvrdik denied it.
In the current corruption case, the criminal investigators worked with the idea that the former president of the Football Association of Romania, Roman Berbr had received a million korun from Slavia for the league title in the 2018-19 season.
It was reported by the football magazine Football, that the police had confiscated parts of the police files.
The president of the club, Jaroslav Tvrdik, said that there was no corruption in the club.
The server revealed police recordings in which Slavia's former sporting director, Jan Nezmar,, who left the club in the summer of 2010, was the main figure.
The former influential member of the Communist Party was in frequent contact with both Berbrem and the former sports director of the second division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogozem,, who is involved in the case.
Criminalists apparently worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi promised financial compensation for winning the title.
In 2019, Slavia won the first league title.
The police organization was informed that, after winning the league,, Slavia had been offered a one million euro bonus by the club' s secretary.
A few days later, according to the criminalists, Berbr also met with Nejmare and the president of the Slavie Tvrdiik football club.
The information from the spy is still unclear, whether the police are still using this information.
Tvrdik rejected all forms of corruption.
In the years 2015 to 2017, they actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to the development of the game.
Tvrdic said that the club had not been involved in any illegal activity and that they had not been involved in any attempt to influence the referee in a way that was contrary to the rules of fair play, and that they had not received any financial compensation in relation to the incident.
In contrast, Nezmar and other players from Slavie with dark skin and Tvirdi also criticized their former coach.
In November 2006, a police raid on several locations, including the FAČR headquarters, took place.
The most prominent figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football activities.
In the middle of January, as well as the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz, was released from custody.

Both forms are literary and have the same meaning, and are freely interchangeable.
Some words may vary regionally,, for example, " ocrek " in Czech and " ocrek " in the region of Moravia. In this case, the Moravian variant is not pronounced. Similarly, other pairs of Czech and Slavic dialects are pronounced differently,, for example, " pirek " in Czech and " pirek " in the region of Moravia and " kobliha " in Czech and " koblih " in the region of Slavia.
Some words, which entered the Czech language from other languages, were originally untranslated, eventually acquiring a Slavic ending.

The Union and the breakup are depicted on the film by the opposers of the breakup of the Soviet Union.
30 years after the illegal dissolution of the Soviet Union.
On December 29, 1991, the biggest geopolitical catastrophe in history occurred.

As a result of the pandemic, the number of people between 35 and 35 years old who have no sex throughout the year has increased.
More and more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
The main focus is on the religiously oriented people, according to the Daily Mail.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of people aged between 35 and 45 who had stopped having sex increased from 8 to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35, who said that the number of sexual encounters in the last year was more than in the previous year.
The decline in the number of sexually active individuals is also influenced by other factors, revealed by a survey conducted by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
