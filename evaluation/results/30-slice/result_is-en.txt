Þet was all recounted here as an introduction to the newest form of Norwegian government, " shadow government " .
Þar where the word is used in the language, it is not clear that it has been defined to the end, but it seems that the following definition is " the most used " . A shadow leader is when the leader of a trade union says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the union to govern the welfare fund.
Ef they fail to follow the orders, they will be killed and expelled from the government at the first opportunity.
is.In the media and in the press, this is called a " shadow government " and this is always the case in the media and in the press.
is. He is trying to persuade the reader to follow a path that is " shadowed " or " shadowed " .
is 25th of July 2020, two men tried to define this concept when it was written.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at the Freetimes newspaper and Ásgeir Jonsson, Secretary General of the State Bank.
Tilefni of this was that the chairman of Icelandair, Bogi Nils Bogason had announced his intention to terminate the airline's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants, and Ragnar Þór Ingolfsson, chairman of the Verslunarmannafelag of Reykjavik sent out the message to the union's representatives at the Lifeyrissjøs of Reykjavik that they would not support the possibility of the union taking over the airline 's share in the company.
Nokkru later,, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and in the wake of this, Ragnar Thore also reversed his decision.

e.g. in the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a large number of shipwrecked sailors and shipwrecked ships, which caused great damage to the environment.

Þa it is unlikely because of the small number of men in the area.
" The probability of this is very low, " says Kamilla, but it is not possible to exclude it until the DNA of the virus has been identified in the man.
"If a new strain of the disease is introduced, it is almost certain that it has been brought to the country. "

Afreksfólk have an additional year to prepare for the Olympics and the Japanese authorities have increased funding for the postponement.
All of them hold on to the end of the house with a great amount of money in the house.
Þegar it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympic Games in 1964, the celebrations of the Japanese Olympic delegation were suspended.
Þeir grreted and hlooed at the end of the competition, because they were not able to hold the Olympic Games in 2016 but they were held in Rio, in Brazil.
The city of Tokyo and Japan were in the spotlight of the world in this time.
24th July to 9th August 2011, the matches were postponed for a year and started on 23rd July 2012 and ended on 8th August 2012.
Ef it is not possible to hold the Olympic Games, if the coronavirus is still a major threat, the threat of the Olympic Games is eliminated.
Enginn wants to think to the end of the thought.
The Olympic Games are not a normal athletics competition.
Ekkert is to be spent on the production, the show is designed to be spectacular and is aimed at surpassing the previous production.
Valið on a city for the Olympic Games is based on the judgement of the selection committee on the presentation of the cities.
is is Því stórfenglegri as the kynning is - því more likely to be successful.
150 million dollars were used to try to hold the Olympic Games in 2016, equivalent to 20 million Norwegian krones.
In the second time,, when the Olympic Games were held in 2020,, 75 million dollars and 10 million krone were spent on the promotion.
2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the Games in 2011,, the Japanese government had invested more than 30 million krone in preparing for the Games.
is 2000. 2004 and 2008. 2012 and 2016. 2012 and 2016. 2012 and 2016. 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 2012 and 2016 20
The organizers in Japan said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which had been postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 126 million dollars.

is. It is likely that it is not possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the matches, but it is estimated that it would cost between two and six million dollars in addition to the original cost.
Heildarkcosts for the Japanese Olympic Committee and the Japanese government could be as high as 15 to 30 million dollars.
Það is so high that all of Norway's tax revenues for the 2008 Olympic Games amounted to less than half of the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are events of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of scrutiny by economists, who have attempted to analyse the impact of the games on the economy.
In the shortest time, it seems that a large number of people have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games on the economy of the cities that hold them is less than favorable.
In some cases, there is a large increase in the number of jobs for a short time,, but in the longer term, cities are often characterized by a high level of unemployment and poorly used man-made structures.
The 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, Brazil were plagued by huge debts due to the cost of maintaining all the large athletic facilities built for the games.
10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.

Einnig, it is unclear whether it is possible to accommodate all the thousands of spectators who normally attend the games.
The most important is the honor that the towns are awarded for being chosen,, but it is difficult to assess the amount of money.
Þraight through the enormous cost, it is also possible to say that the joy that the actors bring is not of the same kind as that of a prize.

Biles says that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop training when the Olympic Games were at its peak and the track and field stadium was closed.
The only exceptions were for Biles,, rather than other athletes,, while all athletic facilities were closed for seven weeks.
