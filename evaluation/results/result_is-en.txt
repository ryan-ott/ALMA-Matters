Hailing to the world.
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland has gone well off the ground and shouting and calling out in the wilderness has begun to attract people from all over the world.
"I have a broken heart, I need to go to Iceland " says a woman living in the United States in a comment on the advertisement from the marketing campaign " Looks Like I Need Iceland " on the YouTube channel.
A second viewer says that he would keep Iceland in his heart forever and a young woman says that she would go to Iceland first because her husband is living there..
It is in the United States, and she plans to stay there for a few months..
Another spectator asks whether the routes to Iceland are open, because there are no planes.
I does not know whether he comes from another time belt.
Egill Þordarson from the advertising company Peel, who came to make the advertisements together with the international advertising company M and C Saatchi, says that the response to the advertisements has exceeded expectations.
"I was inspired by many of the Iceland campaigns that have been successful,, but this new campaign is already breaking records.
In essence, it is about creating publicity, it is to get foreign newspapers to write about the campaign,, and it has gone very well.
In a relatively short time, they have received coverage in more than 700 newspapers and magazines around the world, reaching more than 2 million people.
The value of the coverage is estimated at 180 million Norwegian krones.
Það is not amalegt.
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has gone well there, despite the fact that the United States is not a member of the European Union.
According to Egil, known markets such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also taken well to it, as well as Russia, which came as a pleasant surprise.
This has led to reactions from distant areas,, such as India,, which was not specifically mentioned.
"The clips have been viewed by more than four million people on YouTube, says Egill.
" They had not been able to ask for a better start. "
These pictures were taken by Årni Sæberg, a photographer for the newspaper Morgenbladet, during the filming of advertisements with the slogan " Let It Out " in mid- the last month.
The tours went far and wide,, e.g. on the Skolavordestig in Reykjavik, at Rynisfjør near Skolavordestig, at Solaheimjøkle near Skolavordestig, and in a cave near Hjorleifshöfda.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Pall Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cameraman was Óttar Guðnason.
In the roles of these scenes, were the Irish actress Anna Jia and the German actor Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
The Icelanders came to make the advertisements, at the same time as filming took place in southern Norway, but another group was filming in western Norway and the Westfjords.
According to Egils, " Let It Out " is only the first part of the " Looks Like You Need Iceland " campaign, which will be followed by a winter campaign in collaboration with M and C Saatchi.
"This is only the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Film Institute,, says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M and C Saatchi has gone very well.
"It's fantastic to work with them.
In such projects, it is crucial to have a foreign partner with knowledge of the markets they are talking about.

The story of the Glee cast has become a hit on the Internet because the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California a few days ago and became the third leading actor of the series to die prematurely.
The series about the Glee choir is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The series focused on a group of young students at a high school, their love affairs and their destiny.
It was not always taken with joy to be in the choir, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the series managed to overcome the obstacles that arose in their lives.
1970s and 1980s, there were a number of deaths and injuries among the cast and crew of the films. This led to speculation that the deaths and injuries were the result of a curse on the films.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santonu Lopez in the episode, the mother who did not call all her children.
After the series ran its course, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and they had their first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they split up as a result.
Dorey declined to file a complaint and the domestic abuse case was dropped.
Þann 8th July last year, it was announced that Rivera was missing after her four--year old son was found alone on a boat in Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a lifeboat on board the ship and was able to report to the police that he and his mother had jumped into the water and were rescued by Rivera, but never returned to the ship.
The search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the police chief of the area announced that it was believed that Rivera had drowned.

Only two months after he finished treatment, Moneith was found dead in his hotel room after going out to celebrate with friends..
The poison was a mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not believed that it was an act of will.
Moneith had been in treatment and his tolerance for drugs had decreased so much that a substance he had previously tolerated well proved to be lethal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.

Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah " Puck " Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American football player, similar to Finn, and had little respect for the other members of the Glee choir until he realized that he enjoyed singing and dancing.

He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison, he also had to be on a list of sex offenders and had to seek treatment for child abuse.
In the meantime, Salling, who had been released from custody, was found in the vicinity of his home.
The cause of death was suicide.

He bought a boat after the tenth grade.
"There are not many sailors who work in the kindergartens of the country " says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who works as a fisherman during the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.
The coastal fishing is a very pleasant summer job when one is in school.
If the fishing is good, it is possible to have good income and that it is good to be able to give up the scholarship.
Tekjurnar duga him well in the winter as well,, says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, 25-year old psychology student, who has been engaged in coastal fishing in the summer as well as in previous summers.
Axel arrived at the dock in Tålknafjør late in the evening on the first day of the week when a newspaper reporter spoke to him.
"The winter he was in tenth grade, he took the captain's license for boats under 12 meters and bought his own boat the summer after graduating from high school.
He has been fishing from his boat all summers since..
He bought the boat from a friend, named Hartmann Jonsen, and he named the boat after him.
Hartmann was already an adult when he bought the boat and had stopped sailing, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after Axel took over the ship, and he bought the ship for three million Norwegian krones.
" He made a contract with Hartmann to pay half of the money, one and a half million in the beginning of the summer and the other half in the end of the summer when he had finished fishing.
He owned the boat free of debt at the end of his first summer on it.
In other words, a boy with one and a half million to pay out on a boat when he had just finished high school.
" He had been working with his father at sea when he was a boy, and he had been fishing with him all summer and received his share.
He also put his confirmation money into his own sailing fund.
Axel was born in Ísafjörð, where all his mother's family is from, but he has lived in Kópavog since he was a child.
"He can fish in the west of the country because he has a residence permit with his grandmother in Ísafjörð.
He learned the area on the west coast of Norway with his father from rods.
He travels from one fjord to another depending on how he feels, because the fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
However, he feels that the best place to fish is to the west, but he has also fished in the vicinity of the island of Snaefell and further afield.
I have also fished in the south, where the most common fish is the seal. " Axel, who always goes fishing early in the morning, says that he sometimes talks with the birds and sings to the sky in the early hours of the day.
"Netsambandið out at sea is good, so he can listen to radio broadcasts and music.
It is not a problem to be alone on a boat.
I't is a fact that he tries to avoid getting into trouble, but he has sometimes been unlucky,, but he is lucky that he is not seasick. " says Axel, who is lucky that he is not seasick.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes.
"In fishing, he is never more than 14 hours at sea in one day,, but he has also been on fishing expeditions in other areas,, for example in the lease quota,, but he has been continuously at sea for one and a half days out at sea to fish.
The arrangement for coastal fishing is such that he is allowed to catch 770 kilograms per day, which he finds unsatisfactory.
"Other restrictions are that he can not fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and that he can only fish for 12 days in a month during the four months of stranded fishing in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to stay at home instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to decide for themselves.
Svo mætted the fishing areas were divided in the same way, and fishing places that are well situated near fishing grounds should be allowed to benefit from this., according to Axel, who mainly fishes with salmon on coastal fishing, but also a few other species float with him.
Axel works through the winter with his university studies at the Nupi school in Kópavog..
" He is proud and adds that he only intended to work temporarily at the leikskol..
"He stayed there because he felt that this was a good job.
He hopes that the psychology degree will be useful to him on the secondary school course in the future, " says Axel, who is also well advanced with a degree in business economics.

The villa in the list of people who come to the country was created because one person who was living in the country was not called back for a re-examination.
There is no obligation to write the name of the person on the envelope when it is written in English, as it is when it is written in Icelandic.
"This will be examined in the coming week, " says a specialist in the field of disease prevention at the Ministry of Health.
Three domestic transmissions were detected in the virology department of the Landspitals in the previous day.
Einn þeirre who proved to be positive arrived in the country on the 15th of July, two days after the regulation of the so-called immigrants' homecoming gate took effect.
Those who were living on the island were screened upon their arrival to the country and again four to five days later.
Fram said in the morning news of RTU that he had followed the old system.
The screening at the border was negative and he was not called back for screening for the virus.
In a conversation with the newspaper, Kamilla Rut Sigfusdottir, a specialist in the immunization department of the Ministry of Health, said that this could be traced back to a flaw in the electronic registration passport.
Fylli fólk up the registration sheet in English is not a requirement to put a name like in the Icelandic version.
It was first and foremost intended for foreign tourists.
This means that the person in question had not been invited to take part in the selection process.
Kamilla says that many have followed the rules about homecomings, even though they have filled the registration forms in English and in some cases, the employers have also been aware of sending people back for a second test.
"This will be examined in the coming week how it is possible to make it easier for people to gain access to this, to raise awareness of it. "
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in solitary confinement.
They all underwent a medical examination, two of them showed signs of the disease.
Smitrakning is in progress with the three smits that were detected on the day before, but it is mostly finished due to the two smits that were detected on the day before.
In both cases, DNA analysis by the Institute of Genetics in Iceland revealed that they were variants of the coronavirus that had not previously been found in the country.
In the other case, the bonds have been directed to Iceland, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it would be clear on the next day where the infection was coming from.
There are now 15 people in isolation due to the virus. en.
135 are in quarantine.
Fjögur of five infections are unrelated.
Five domestic transmissions have been detected in Norway in the past days.
The four are completely unrelated and have not been traced back to the outbreak at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in 2010.
Smitrakning is still ongoing.
The original number was 30, but they were reduced to 16.
In total, 34 people are in quarantine due to the new infections that were discovered the day before.
It is the second time in a short time that a case of infection has been detected at an athletic event and has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
He says that it is possible as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
"They are constantly urging all those who live in the area to maintain individual sexually transmitted disease prevention..
They also need to emphasize to people who are organizing events that there are certain rules in place that must be followed.
Þá it is possible to hold events. "Jøhann says.
He says that it is possible to prevent the spread of infection by preventing the spread of individual infections.
Regulations and guidelines are also under constant review.
"The thing that needs to be done, and which the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Health constantly urge people to do,, is to take care of the individual sexually transmitted disease prevention.
Bæði at home and abroad and at the same time at the service company.
People wash their hands and use sprit.
Það prevents the spread of the infection. " he says.
"They need to emphasize to people to continue on the good path they were on, in order to maintain the success they have achieved so far. "
40 % of the victims of the disease were suffering from syphilis 2.
Devon Brumfield heard through the telephone how difficult it was for her father to breathe.
Her father was suffering from syphilis and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was buried.
Andlati was racked by sudden respiratory difficulties due to the coronavirus infection.
Sickness was recorded on the death certificate as the underlying cause and Brumfield, who is also suffering from sykursyke, is afraid that he will die.
The Reuters news agency says that the fear of Brumfield is unreasonable.
The results of a new survey carried out by American authorities revealed that nearly 40% of those who died were suffering from syphilis type 2, which is the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those under 65 years of age is considered, the proportion rises to half.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) took to more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus during the period from February to May.
The results are stunning, especially for those who have syphilis and their partners.
In 12 of the 12 countries surveyed, the proportion of women in the workforce is the same as the proportion of men in the workforce.
10 states, among which are California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet separated from underlying diseases.
"Sickness was when the epidemic was in its early stages.
Now, the disease has broken through as a powerful force like an avalanche " according to Reuters, Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Syphilis is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also been affected more severely by the viral infection.
One of the best defenses for those with syphilis 2 is to keep the disease in check with physical exercise, a healthy diet, and the assistance of health professionals.
The coronavirus epidemic has, however, made it difficult for many to maintain routine.
In the meantime, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue to work in order to avoid being exposed to the virus..
Reuters reports that American authorities have been aware of the risk that those with syphilis 2 could be affected by the virus.
In 2003, 20% of those affected by SARS and in 2009, this group was three times more likely to be hospitalized.
In 2012, when MERS became more prevalent, a study showed that 60 percent of those who died or were hospitalized were suffering from syphilis.
The effects of the Covid 19 virus could last longer, because of this, the epidemic has stripped the veil from a number of previously unknown follow--up illnesses.
" He fears that there will be a flood of sykursyke people when this is over. "
Doctors have warned that the viral epidemic could indirectly lead to an increase in the incidence of diseases associated with syphilis, such as kidney disease and kidney failure.
There are new research on the possibility that the coronavirus could lead to an increase in syphilis cases.
The scientists are trying to understand the connection between the coronavirus and syphilis 2.
The virus affects the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weakened in people with syphilis.
This means that a high proportion of glucose and lipids in the bodies of those with diabetes can cause a genuine " cellular storm " as it is called when the body's immune system reacts too strongly.
Damaged intracellular membranes can also lead to the formation of bubbles, which in turn can lead to the formation of blood clots.
"It's all one big puzzle, " says Dela Cruz.
"This is connected to all of them. "
Fréttin has been corrected.
"They were offered camp wine, then they left the room. "
The couple, Åsrún Magnusdottir and Atli Bollason were given the unusual offer from the filmmaker Ragnar Kjartansen to have sex in front of the camera for a film he was making in Paris.
"They loved each other so much that it was not complicated. "
Atli Bollason never forgets when he meets his wife and mother-in law, Åsrúun Magnúsdottir, for the first time.
" He was very impressed by her.
It was natural that it was the sunlight, but he also thought that she was very attractive.
Og þykir enn, " he says.
Ásrún knows this too, because her husband, the first person to find it,, regularly reminds her of it.
"He hears this story all the time.
Síðast bara over the weekend, " she said that she fell in love with her husband at first sight.
"I felt and still feels that there was a lot of tension around Atla,, which she likes..
There are a lot of things going on and a lot of things are happening, and he was fascinated by this..
Atli says that the couple have emphasized their own paths in their relationship.
"They do not tie the ropes of their boats with the same knots as their fellow sailors.
In the past, they avoided routines that they perceived in their surroundings.
It is possible that this is the reason that they took the initiative from Ragnar Kjartansen, with enthusiasm,, even though it was unusual.
"Kirstine Anna, a common friend of theirs has contacted them and asked if they could come to dinner with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg, at Snap. "
They accepted the invitation and met the three--sided at Snap and received dessert wine and each of their own after dinner.
They listened to Ragnar as he led them through his plans for an exhibition of his paintings at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
"He had a video work called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it in a simple way.
Ásrún says that he described the incident as a banal and decadent scene from the daily life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he wanted to shoot, and at the end, he told them that he wanted to know whether they were interested in taking part. "
Senan as Ragnar bade the pair to take part in a show to show young middle class couples falling in love in a minimalistic room.
"This is a collaboration with a beginning and an end, " says Atli.
Parið þekkted Ragnar little, though they had known of him and he of them " but they knew them and felt they fit the role.
They said that they did not want to advertise for people.
It is possible that they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who would have sex with them because they were performing for others.
They sent Ragnar off and agreed to discuss the matter, but it took a short time.
"When they walked out of Snap, they said, " They are not only in this. "
This was just like that.
I trusted Ragnar as a musician and all of his team. " says Ásrún and Atli.
"It's about love and closeness. "
Senan was taken up in a fine apartment in the Mýrargotten.
There was a very small film crew, the director Ragnar, the cameraman and the soundman.
After the fire was lit, all of the rooms were evacuated to wait outside in the car, except for Atli and Ásrún.
"They were not done with deciding what they wanted to do.
They received some instructions, but they forgot time and place.
To be unaware of what they were doing and for whom.
Það was not played, they only loved each other so it was not complicated. says Åsrún.
En was romantic.
" It was a little romantic, " says Atli and Åsrún agrees.
"They were offered champagne before they left the room..
This was like being on holiday in a luxury hotel in Paris.
The team was pleased with the pair's performance in the play that moved them.
"When Tommi looked at it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful. " says Atli.
"It's just as much about love and closeness and their own relationships with each other. "
The parents have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice of the son at the National Theatre in Reykjavik and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to think about it " says Atli.
"Mamma and dad saw it in Paris.
I didn't say this to anyone, but he sent a letter to his father and said " It was fun to meet the little family in the Palace of Tokyo. "
Og it is believed that the participation of the characters in the play has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atle.
"We're still together, it may have deepened a little.
Þetta deepened his relationship with his extended family, " says Åsrún and laughs.
Sjalf was in Kaupmannahöfen with his colleagues.
"It was difficult to be with someone other than her husband., " she says and turns to her husband.
"It was fun to see it, because it is only one scene in a larger work, and when it is seen with the other works, it is very attractive.
I was able to break away from this a little and was proud.
Og there was a small baby in the stomach of her husband, when the incident was filmed..
"It was beautiful. "

After she left Iceland, she became acquainted with international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed before Voorst's successor arrived in September 2010.
It can be traced in part to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador, then resigned.
He had worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for more than a decade.
He resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador in Guatemala.
He then took up a second term as ambassador.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015 and took up his post shortly after,, with no ambassador having been stationed in the country for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but was not a diplomat, and had worked as a lawmaker and fundraiser for Barack Obama.
He resigned as ambassador to the United States on 20 January 2017 when Donald Trump took over as president, as is usual with a diplomatic ambassador.
It took a long time for Trump to appoint both ambassadors and high--ranking officials in the government in Washington.
It took two years for the United States Congress to call Jeffrey Ross Gunter to its floor to confirm him as the United States ambassador to Iceland..
In his testimony at the parliament, he said that he had never visited Iceland, but often visited Western Europe, and that his wife, who died, was of Norwegian descent.
Gunter is politically appointed and was previously a physician in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The owner of the Spilavit company, Sheldon Adelson, founded the organization, but Adelson is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, when there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months.
The reason for this is both the length of time it took for Trump to appoint people to key positions, and the length of time it took to confirm ambassadors.
Since 2009, there has been no ambassador in Iceland for five years.
It has, however, not prevented the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which opened new headquarters at Engjateig in 2008.
The construction is estimated to have cost around 65 million euros, the building is surrounded by a 10- meter (33 ft) high protective wall and bulletproof glass is used in all windows.
It seems that the current ambassador does not have enough confidence because he is said to fear for his life and has asked for armed protection.
The former player of ÍBV was subjected to racism in Norway - " It was a mistake to come to Norway "
Tonnay Mawejje, a former player of ÍBV, said that he was subjected to racism when he was in Norway and that he regrets coming to Norway.
This comes from an interview with Tonny, which was published in the Ugandan newspaper Daily Monitor.
He went to the Uganda Police Football Club, which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In an interview with the Daily Monitor, he talks about many things, including his time in Norway, he played with IBV, Val and Throtti in Norway.
"When he came to Iceland, he did not play in the middle as he was used to,.
Fyrirliði of the team was in that position, but he also had a jersey number that he wanted,, and he got both of them. " said Tony, who played on the right side of the field during the season with ÍBV.
Among other things, Tonny talks about racism that he experienced in Norway.
He says this is a problem for many black players when they play in Europe.
"This happened to him once,, but because he did not understand the language, he ignored everything that was said to him..
I later learned of the matter and then asked his friend what the matter was about.
He said that his opponent had made racist remarks about him after he took him down.
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He says that he has made the mistakes that he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to get himself in the starting lineup of Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get a place in the national team.
Þá he asked him to go back to Ireland on loan, he then went to join Val.
"It was a mistake to return to Iceland on loan.
Eg held that if he had been in Norway for longer, he would have received the opportunities he wanted. Tonny said that he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would be able to go further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has made it impossible for him to fulfill his dreams of playing in a big team in Europe.
A fish was found in the throat of a woman.
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 38 mm long black worm in the throat of a woman who had been sent there.
The fishermen dragged the whale out with a pole.
Research led to the conclusion that it was a parasitic infection.
CNN reports from this..
Kona had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman became ill quickly after the worm was removed, but parasitic organisms such as this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi became popular in Western countries, the number of cases where parasitic worms have infected people has increased, according to CNN.
I fear that a second wave is about to start in Europe.
The Spanish are now in the limelight due to concerns about the spread of another wave of the corona virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to halt the spread of the new outbreak.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but it is more widespread than in Barcelona, where the disease is spreading.
The other European countries have also taken action in response to the spread of the infection in Spain, but in Britain all those returning from Spain have to go into quarantine, like in Norway and France, and the French have been warned against travelling to Spain.
Smitum is also expanding in France and Germany, where the authorities are trying to balance the need to restrict the spread of the virus with the need to restart the economy.
The situation in Europe is, however, good compared to other parts of the world, and the number of new infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 per day, with the highest number of new infections in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide, with 644,000 deaths attributed to the virus.
Mosaic work by Gerðar is finally given its full glory.
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavik there is a large and deep hole.
There are men with orange helmets on top of her.
There is also a large grave.
and a number of smaller work vehicles.
The road is closed for traffic.
The gangstéet is wide and there are now many who stand there and admire the millions of mosaic tiles,, like they have never seen them before..
It is possible that they had never seen it before.
At least, he did not see it for himself.
It has been hidden up until now, it was in front of it, there were parking spaces that were always occupied.
People left the car in a hurry and rushed off to their assignments in the city center.
"Lively and diverse public space " and " an attractive cityscape " are the guiding lights of the reconstruction of the Tryggvagate.
The goal is to improve the appearance of the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerda Helgadottir at the Toll House to be seen better.
In front of the construction site, a square and the area where the road lies well with the sun is thought to be suitable as a rest area for travellers.
The sculpture is lit up and is now able to be seen in a better way on the 142- square metre area.
In the area, there are also small " water sculptures ", which offer play and provide the area with a certain mysticism.
In this way, the renovations are described by the municipality of Reykjavik as being carried out in conjunction with Veitums.
Lagnir for water, heat and electricity are to be rebuilt.
In the 1920s, the school and the cold water pipeline were built, they have therefore served the inhabitants and companies in the middle of the city for nearly a century.
When the road is reopened after the completion of the works, cars can be driven on it again.
The road is, however, one--way, and as a result, there are more peaceful and accessible spaces for pedestrians..
In the records of the toll office, it is stated that the building was opened in 1971, and the architect was Gisli Halldorsson.
Due to the harbor flooding reaching through the house, a 250 square metre gap in the wall facing the street was formed.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a flat surface would have a negative impact on the overall image of the city, that it would be necessary to make special arrangements to decorate the facade of the house.
The parties agreed that they would erect a permanent monument there.
At this time, there was a lot of talk about Gerði Helgadottir, artist,, in the compilation.
She had worked extensively in mosaic art in Germany and other countries.
It was only after the first contact with her that it was decided whether a competition would be held for the work.
Often discussions had been made about the need to reflect the life of the harbor in the film, as the harbor had been the life of Reykjavik since it was built.
When the artist was interviewed, she was overwhelmed by the work.
It was agreed that she would be given drawings and other assistance before she left the country,, where she would work on the proposals from abroad.
Gerður received the time she wanted, and when she returned home, she put forward a number of proposals for discussion.
It was unanimously agreed to ask her to work on the project.
At the same time, she was asked to make a joint agreement with the famous sculpture company Oidtmann brothers in Germany, with whom she had long worked on the reconstruction of famous sculptures in various parts of Europe.
The contracts were signed and Gerður won the contract for the construction of the building,, which was then used for the construction of the toll house.
All the work was carried out extremely well by both Gerðar Helgadottir and the Oidtmann brothers, it says in the summary.
It has withstood the storms of the Irish weather since then.
It took Gerði two years to complete the work, which was written and performed in 1972 and 1973.
She died two years after the completion of the tollhouse, at the age of 47.

Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the
This said by the minister in the episode of Sprengisand on Bylgjunni in the afternoon.
The fire prevention department of the Housing and Building Agency was moved to Sauðarøy in autumn..
The fire brigade's specialists work at the institution but none of them intend to follow the fire brigade to the north and the National Association of fire brigade and rescue helicopter pilots have criticized the evacuation.
" He believes that they should take further steps in this situation.
He is preparing for further steps in this career.
"There will be more flights, " said Asmundur..
He says that he is convinced that the vast majority of the population wants a greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
"He held that further political decisions were needed about the transfer of public jobs outside the country,, such as the move of the Housing and Building Agency to Selfoss and the Land Mapping Agency to Akranes, and the employment of unemployed people in Skagastrød.

The 94th edition of the Iceland Athletics Championships ended at Thorsvoll in Akureyri on the day.
A number of records were broken on the second day of competition.

Vigdís won back the national record earlier in the summer and has been in fantastic form in the second half of the season, and she has improved the national record three times during the season.
Elisabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and did not play in the match.
She had only one good throw of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.

He is not punished for the 27 million krone Bitcoin harvest.
Yfirskattanefnd has rejected the claim of the Chief Inspector of Police, who demanded that a man be punished for failing to report his income from the sale of Bitcoin.
Nefndin comes to the conclusion that the head of the investigation agency did not have a clear rationale for arresting the man.
In the verdict of the board, it was stated that the man had been judged to have violated the statutory regulations regarding his income in the years of 2016 and 2017.
Henn had overestimated his profits from the sale of his Bitcoin business to 27 million, either intentionally or due to gross negligence.
The man was sentenced for his behaviour.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
He went ahead with the idea of selling rafmynt for 27 million in 2016.
In the years 2009 and 2010, it was easy and cheap to acquire such hardware with a normal home computer.
He pointed out that when he sold the rafmyntina, the tax for such a sale had been very unclear and unforeseeable.
It was not possible to anticipate that ordinary citizens would become aware of such arrangements in the allocation of taxes.
He had not intended to avoid paying the tax on the harvest and had made clear his ownership of the property on the register as a deposit on an account.
He had tried to persuade both experts and the Director of the Ministry of Finance about the matter, but without success.
He thought that he had to take account of the fact that he was neither born nor raised in Ireland and had only lived in the country for a few years when he started digging for gold.
He had been in a worse position than others in that he had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion about
The man believed that his compensation for the two fiscal years would be reassessed and that he would be punished, but not otherwise.
He repeated that he was working in Norway and had paid taxes in Norway since 2012.
He had never intended to escape from his obligations in a disreputable manner.
Krafan against the sect was widespread and would throw him into debt.
" This man knows what football is about. "
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been a controversial figure in Norwegian football. he has also attracted praise for his performances with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max-deildin.
Blikar will be in the firing line in the evening when they take on ÍA in a live broadcast on Stød 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is suspended from playing for four games due to four warnings during the season, and therefore does not play with a new haircut as in the games of the season so far.
He had written " bla, bla, bla " on the top of his head for the match against HK the previous Friday, which HK won 1 – 0.
"He didn't know exactly who he was going to pay, but he said that he was trying to play the game.
He did not go into hiding.
Hann wants to get the ball in every game and when there was a threat to equalize the game, he thought that he would do it or make it. " said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stadium when talking about Brynjolff.
"I will be there for the people. "
"It is sometimes difficult to figure out what position he is in.
Hjörvar Hafliðason said, "He goes out a little to the left when the game starts,, but he has a very free role in the team..
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says that Brynjolf is a good comedian and welcomes him to the league. " There is no disagreement about the fact that he is a character.
This is a fun person and he likes his hair, and he is always ready to meet and respond in interviews.
It is incredible that many people are fascinated by him, which shows that this man knows what football is.
" he is a comedian.
I's to be there for the people and have fun with it.
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólf and people are buying tickets and watching what comes next on his hair.
Þessi man is a genius, " said Máni.
The KR player says he wants to leave the club - " He has been in contact with several teams in the second division. "
Tobias Thomsen, KR's player in the Pepsi Max division, seems to have left the team.
According to the Danish newspaper Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Fótbolti.net also reported on the case..
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country,, but first he has to terminate his contract with KR, as the Danish league starts earlier than the Norwegian one.
Félagið veit that he misses Denmark and has shown him a lot of understanding,, said Tobias in an interview with Bold.
" He has been in contact with a number of teams in the second division and is likely to move to another team before the end of the Norwegian season.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay the salary of his contract with KR.
He says that he will have to take a salary cut in Denmark.
" Associations in Denmark have probably found more for the economic effects of the virus than in Iceland. "
Hjolviseur Bjartmar has recovered millions of hjols after the DV coverage. now he has to answer for himself after the DV coverage.
In the past year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby that is different from most others.
Henn þefar up and rescues lost and stolen riding horses, racing horses, bicycles and helicopters.
He has earned the nickname " the hitchhiker " for his travels.
In the past,, there was a great flock of birds when the man told about his relationship with Bjartmar..
He told DV that he had met Bjartmar on the square and that he had told him that the man had stolen the wreath.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the pilot, other than that Bjartmar had stolen him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the beginning of the original DV report has been altered in accordance with it.
Bjartmar says that the original reports of the incident were not accurate for what actually happened in the morning of the 12th of August in the area of Austervelt.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from the victim of a rape victim that these were indeed his rape victims.
The information he received from the alleged owner was false, Bjartmar says.
" He saw the cows and he recognized the trailer,, which had been missing for a long time and had been searched for.
I hesitated for a while, but when he saw him preparing to leave on the helicopter, he decided to talk to the man..
The owner was convinced in his actions and decided to have a conversation with the man.
Almennt, he goes very well in such matters,, but before he managed to complete what he had to say, the man had taken away his words..
Bjartmar says that the man on the helicopter offered him to show him the ticket for the helicopter and called the police himself.
"Já, flott, " said Bjartmar, " few get it straight. "
The owner of the helicopter proved his ownership of the helicopter and took off.
The owner of the helicopter told his story on Facebook, like in the first report..
Bjartmar says that he has been able to count the number of times he has been on the wrong side of people on the other hand.
" He has had peaceful relations with the most difficult men in Reykjavik,, he said, and pointed to the fact that bicycle racers are the smallest brothers and sisters of society, fighters, disabled people and other people who live on the streets.
" Fíknin is a harsh landlord and, unfortunately, theft is easy on these loose funds. " says Bjartmar.
" His relationship with these people is so good that he has brought many of these good people with him in the team.
Dæmi are of people going into treatment and taking it on and seeking help from him and assisting him with what he is doing. " he says.
In general, Bjartmars' interactions with horseback riders are on a courteous basis.
Some people know of him and what he is doing, and are willing to give him a passport and registration number for his bicycle..
Horse theft is a major problem that has been neglected.
Ennfremor, Bjartmar says that the police have started to tell people to talk to him because of stolen horses.
Bjartmar is not happy with the earlier reporting of DV and says that he is not a self--appointed police officer in the pursuit of justice.
He is asked whether he is not yet fully on the ice with his actions,, and that this is first and foremost the role of the police. Bjartmar says.
"In fact, the police have to do this,, but the reality of the matter is that the police are not doing it.
He has, among other things, observed police officers driving away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She is utterly innocent in these matters.
"When the police are not doing anything in this, and it is only in front of his nose, and experience has shown that he has achieved success in this matter,, he says.
The man says that he has achieved so great success in catching stolen horses on the streets that he sometimes runs into his " opponents " on the streets, and that these opponents have only Bjartmari's horse that they had previously stolen.
The times that Bjartmar has called for assistance from the police have come to the point that she has not met him.
"This is not working with the police, and it is not the police's fault and it is not the owners of the horse carriers' fault in this case. " said Bjartmar and it is believed that the victims of horse carriage theft have to suffer because the police in this case are incompetent.
Bjartmars's achievements are not disputed.
Widespread is the story that Bjartmari was able to get his property back to him.
Sjálfur says Bjartmar has long since lost count of the number of bicycles he has given away, but that the amount is likely in the millions or tens of millions.
Vega there jet engines, jet planes and heavy jet planes, but jet planes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works until the end of the day at a kindergarten and every other week he works at a commune.
His horse riding career is a hobby that he pursues in his spare time.
Lífeyrissjøds and long shadows.
In 2019, a number of anniversaries were celebrated in the history of the labour welfare associations in Iceland.
Embættismenn had been granted pensions from the Danish king all years of the 19th century, but in 1919 a life-etime pension fund for embassy staff was established, which eventually became a life time pension fund for all public servants.
The foundation for the current national labour unions was laid in 1969 with the signing of a general labour agreement on the workplace, which stipulated the establishment of affiliated labour unions with mandatory membership and full--fledged union membership from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were established on the basis of these agreements, and the welfare system continued to grow after that.
It was not the only radical change that the labour movement of the 20th century achieved through its struggle for wages.
In the famous strikes of 1955, strikes for wage protection had been achieved in a similar manner, and the union also gradually gained recognition for sick pay and welfare, shorter working hours, improvements in housing and other similar matters.
All of these rights were fought for with great effort and persistence, but in the end proved to be greater and more permanent than the increase in wages in the salary scale, which disappeared as soon as the war ended and continued until the 1990s, as many people remember..
The prelude to the establishment of the general welfare organizations in 1969 was both long and complex.
But in the end, men came together to agree that the funds were in fact the property of the workers' unions, and that the governing bodies of these unions would be made up of equal numbers of representatives from the employers and the workers.
In the following years after the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers in the management of the funds was often the subject of debate in labour organizations,, but it never reached a majority., and so the situation remains that representatives of workers are not in a majority in the management of the funds.
In the 36th section of the law number 129 from 1997 on the obligatory employment rights and the activities of the employment funds, it is mentioned about the investment strategy of the employment funds.
In the 1st line of the 1st stanza, it says that " the labourers' welfare is the focus of the labourers' welfare organization. "
It also says in the 5th line of the 5th verse that the Lifesavings Fund would set its own ethical standards in its investments.
In the hluthafastefne of the Lifeyrissjøen, among other things, there are the following provisions in the wake of the previous provisions.
Lifeyrissjøen is a member of the United Nations ( UN PRI ) regulations on responsible investments, together with many of the largest life insurance societies and financial investors in the west and in Europe.
In the regulations, it is stated that the emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good governance in the management of companies, can contribute to improved financial results.
In this way, the interests of the shareholders and the goals of the nation are combined in a wider context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those that are listed on the stock exchange, set out a public agenda for good governance, salaries and environmental issues.
The Labourers' Settlement Society Gildi, which is one of the largest companies in the country, has set its " guidelines for responsible investments " and there are provisions of the same nature.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest fashion in the Norwegian language, " shadow governance " .
In the case of orðiated in the language, it is not likely that it has been fully defined, but it seems that the following definition is " the most taken " . Shadow governance is when the leader of a trade union says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the union to the board of the welfare fund to give instructions or instructions on how to take a position in a particular matter.
If they do not follow the instructions, they will be dismissed from the government at the first opportunity.
Ef the foremost man does not use this in the media and does not talk about resignation, it is not " shadow government " in fact, there are such communications between people in the financial world all the time.
I wants the reader to think about which way is " shadowy " .
There are only two men who have tried to shape this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of 25 July 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at the newspaper Fréttablade, and Asgeir Jonsson, Director of the State Bank.
In both cases, the reason was that Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the contracts of the airline's flight attendants and flight attendants. Ragnar Þór Ingolffsen, chairman of the Verslunarmannafelag of Reykjavik sent out the suggestion to the representatives of the union in the board of the Lifeyrissjøk of Reykjavik that they should not support the possibility of the union buying shares in the company, otherwise they would be fired.
Nokkru later, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and in the wake of this, Ragnar Þør followed suit with his criticism of Boga's decision.
The two men, Hörður and Ásgeir, saw reason to talk about the matter in the Friday edition of the newspaper Fréttablaðen with large words about shadow governance, lawbreaking and the need for changes to the law.
There was a small worm that carried a heavy load, though the blessed worm was in a dangerous situation and was drying up quickly.
It is important to focus on the substance itself at the end.
He traced the relevant sections of the laws governing the life-etime pension funds..
In this, the board of trustees are obliged to take care of the interests of the beneficiaries and have ethical standards in their investments, and this is further specified in the regulations of both the Gild and the Lifeyrissjøds.
Lífeyrissjóðs do not, however, focus solely on short--term profit in their investments.
This is exactly a dangerous course and it is not difficult to find examples of this in the past,, where huge sums of money from banks and funds have been lost to unscrupulous adventurers and environmental disasters with catastrophic consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was clearly on thin ice when he decided to fire a large group of employees, severely weakening the company's position on the Icelandic market and weakening its position with investors.
As it turned out, he saw it and pulled it back.
The newspaper TIME reveals that it is possible that the investment of the labour union's funds in the company can be considered as a burden to the union's members.

I was one of the survivors who did not have a homecoming ceremony.
The one of the three who was diagnosed with the disease in the country on the 15th of July last year, came to the country from the Baltic countries for about one and a half weeks before.
He is an Icelander who is not permanently resident in the country and did not receive clear instructions about the use of the home country's immigration policy after arriving in the country and took a second test a few days after arriving in the country..
He was rejected by the border guards.
" He is in the Norwegian society and in reality he is supposed to be in this kind of treatment while he is on vacation,, says Kamilla Josepsdottir, a specialist in the security department at the Ministry of Health, in a conversation with the newspaper Fréttablade in the day.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the kennel numbers and if the kennel numbers are not registered, they are not called for the second round. "
Hún says that the man used the English registration form because he is in fact resident abroad, but because of his ties to Norway he should have used the Norwegian form.
He has, however, not understood it.
"When the kennitalan is not registered, he has to seek it himself in the second test..
Hvorki he and his employer realized that it was the right way. "
" Therefore, it is clear that there is a need to increase the information given about this while they try to find a way to make self--identification systems, although the Icelanders do not register their birth certificates..
I want to make it clear that there are people involved in the Icelandic society in the registration system. " she explains.
In the end,, however,, he was able to avoid being classified as an immigrant, because he was considered to be a member of the Norwegian community in Norway.
Only six were sent into quarantine after he was diagnosed the day before, and these six were all in a relationship with him.
The two of them are already showing symptoms of the disease.
The man received negative results from his test at the border on the 15th of July.
Kamilla says that it is likely that he had been recently infected with the virus, that he had not been able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not rule out the possibility that the man was infected in Iceland, but did not carry the infection to the country.
"It is not possible to say that it is an imported infection because it has been a long time since he came to the country and that he could have been exposed to it in the same way as the two who have caused a small outbreak in connection with athletic competitions. "
It says, however, that it is very unlikely due to the small number of men in the area.
" It is in fact very unlikely, " says Kamilla, but it is not possible to rule it out until the Institute of Genetics has sequenced the virus in the man.
"If a new strain of the virus is introduced, it is almost certain that it was brought to the country. "

It is not the game that defines the season.
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the match against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game and Chelsea does not lose to Wolves,, Solskjær and his men end up in 5th place and miss out on the Champions League.

The Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of the disease on Thursday and Friday.
Þar have been more than 1,000 new cases in a single day since the beginning of May and the news comes at the same time as Spain begins to lift the strictest outgoing ban in Europe.
This led to the fact that the British authorities forced the passengers who came from Spain to stay in quarantine upon their return to the United Kingdom.
Viku was previously on the British list of safe countries..
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the north--east of Spain, where the authorities have taken widespread measures to try to stop the growth.

As a result of the ban, 200,000 inhabitants of Segria County in the western part of Catalonia are forbidden to leave.
It is believed that the decision of the British will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the aftermath of the plague.
Tui, the largest airline in Britain, cancelled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands on the day.
The governments of many countries are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but little enthusiasm has been shown to reinstate the widespread ban on outgoing travel that has devastated the economy.
In addition, Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken a very negative view of such and similar weapons that he does not want to use.
The Prime Minister of France, Jean Castex has said that the nation " would not survive economically or socially " if the ban was reintroduced.

It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
The number of visitors to the tents is expected to increase this year, if the weather does not interfere with the calculations, but DV said earlier in the day that the weather forecast was bad.
However, the worst weather is expected in the south, and there is hope for Patreksfjord..
Vefurinn bb.s said first, and said that all other accommodation in the city were already full.
Heilt fjölbýlishus fell down on the best place in the city.
Romanian workers live freely on Dunhaga 18 – 20.
In the meantime, the owners are pursuing building permits for renovations, but their efforts have been hampered by the bureaucracy in the third year.
In one of the oldest, most ancient and most expensive neighborhoods of the city of Reykjavik, stands a multi--story housing complex.
In the basement of the house, there are about 600 square meters of warehouse space.
In front of the house, there are two staircases, each of which contains four fairly large apartments..
They are between 93 and 130 square metres,, although most are over 100.
The house has a significant history.
It was built in 1959 and has also housed a video rental, the Mjolkursamsolen's milk processing plant, a canning plant, and most recently the University Press.
The house has been so beautifully renovated that it is hard to believe that it was built in the 17th century..
The house is now severely damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 are, according to the company register, Magnus Magnusson and Guðrún Helga Lárusdottir.
Magnus was a member of the Borgun owners' group and was the head of the Borgun ownership group.
In the group of owners of the Borgun company, is Stalskip.
Stålskip AS is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdottir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third of D18.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, ran the outfit Stálskip once..
The house was bought in the summer of 2009 and has been neglected since then.
The neighbors say that the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since, though most of the deterioration has occurred in recent years.
The house has not been " particularly lively " in the last few years.
It can be played in that the owners have been trying to change the house and the land for a number of years.
The other neighbors say that the house has not been in good condition for a long time.
"It is long overdue to do something about this spot and it is a shame that it has dragged on for so long. "
Segir hann jafnfratically that he is unhappy with the owners of the house for not forcing him to finish the project and find a common ground with his neighbors..
"To do this, in coordination with the community in the surrounding area, so that it is possible to drive the project and complete it. "
"The planning process " that the inhabitant refers to is the planning process that has been going on since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 applied for permission to build a new building on top of the existing housing complex and behind the house, a new lift house and an underground building.
The building permit granted for the construction was challenged to the Supreme Court of Norway and the Supreme Court ruled that the construction was not in accordance with the land-scape plan and that the landmarking was inadequate.
The municipality of Reykjavik started work on the district plan in 2009 and finished it with an announcement in the Stjørnartidin newspaper in July 2010.
This arrangement was also condemned and abolished by the board in March 2020.
At this time, three years had passed since the original application for building permission and the owners of the house at the beginning of the site.
The house had fallen into disrepair and the neighbours were tired of it.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and their reactions, they responded in various ways.
Some understood the intentions of the house owner, others did not..
Others directed their reins at the city, others did not.
Others were angry but not out for revenge.
Other said that the parking areas were crowded, that neighbors have used the unused parking areas of Dunhaga 18 – 20 for their own vehicles.
He said that he was tired of the government.
"If they have to go through the process three times, it is unbelievable.
It is as if the city of Reykjavik could not read.
In the day, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
Miniswares about the chaos of the city's administration and the grand plans of the owner and many years of work.
When a reporter came to the garden at Dunhaga 18, the doors burst open and garbage piles.
The Playstation and the new television lay among other rubbish on the ground - they were the sacrificial victims of Norwegian summer camping..
It was opened in the old printing room of the University, and there were a large number of cats with the smell of the land.
It is clear that someone has moved in one of the corners,, but no one can be seen.
Stacks of sofas and mattresses, and a number of geological maps were strewn across the floor.
The rooms of the house were also open and life was in both of them.
The reporter was so lucky to meet two of them.
There were Romanians cooking their potato soup in the evening meal and they invited a journalist to join them.
The Romanians are working for the workforce of the Strongforce company.
They have been there for some time and according to DV, the company has not paid for the house, only heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not feasible to collect rent.
It is clear from the positions of posters in the entrance of the house that there have been a large number of foreign workers in the house in the last few years.
In addition, the recession in the tourism industry has led to a recession in the construction industry, and these two branches have been the most active in using the services of labour leagues.
In contrast, the inhabitants of Dunhaga 18 appeared to have more to do and were still working in the fields after a long day in the rain.
In spite of the poor condition of the house, the boys' living quarters appeared to have been well maintained.
When the newspaper reporter asked the Romanian boys, he suddenly became cold and clear that the best place in Reykjavik is a 1,500 square metre property that has been demolished.
The owners want to change the house to improve it, and the neighbors disagree on the definition of " improvement.
In the middle is the city's initial planning area, the site of endless lawsuits and legal loopholes in the planning process, as well as the site of the Supreme Court of Norway 's decisions on the environment and natural resources.
In the house, live Romanian workers,, possibly those who are working to improve the situation when the Norwegians leave..
The article originally appeared in the Sunday edition of DV on 17 July.
In the aftermath of the coronavirus epidemic, a campaign against overweight was launched.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds in a campaign against obesity, which includes a ban on fast food advertisements after he suffered a serious illness partly due to his weight.
In the meantime, Johnson is scheduled to launch his campaign, on Monday, but with the campaign he is encouraging doctors to recommend hiking as a treatment for overweight patients, as well as launching a campaign against the proliferation of hiking paths.
The broadcasting of advertisements for fast food restaurants in television is prohibited after 21:00 in the evening according to British media sources.

Það was women, " said Helga.
" Women in Iceland are famous for their women's movement.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
In this way, it is now up to them to lead these changes.
She said that she felt uneasy about the emphasis on Iceland as " the best in the world " in terms of gender equality and human rights.
"Then, they are not as prepared to examine what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and study everything that has to be done.
Það is a lot.
They have to know where they are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listening to the voices of marginalized groups.
I don't live under the same rules all over the country, " said Helga.
When asked, she said that women are in many ways in good shape in Iceland, but added that, like in many other places, the Icelanders live in a very masculine society.
She said that politics revolved around personal interests, dominance and power, which were the forces that perpetuated misrule in all societies.
"The women have now formed a group and come together and they are frustrated that Alþingi is ignoring the 2012 vote. "
"It is these feminine qualities that they are thinking about.
From the perspective of human rights and nature protection,, cooperation and the fact that they all sit at the same table,, she said and added that these were the founding principles of the new constitution.
" The country is rich in natural resources and it is unfathomable that there are people living in poverty.
Það is far-fetched, they can split in a different way,, said Helga.
"It is far-fetched that there is a natural law that women's jobs are always paid less.
It is unfathomable that flight attendants and nurses have to fight endlessly for wages that are equal to those of men.
It is possible to sign under the new constitution of Norway on the island of Iceland by means of a computer..

Tugir in quarantine and some of them have started to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Fimm people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus in Norway in the last three days and most of them are not related to each other.
They are in quarantine because of this, and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people were diagnosed with the coronavirus in the past day and two at the border checkpoint.
A specialist at the Ministry of Health says that the increasing number of domestic transmissions does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in society.
"It has been analyzed from the first domestic infection and it is a virus that has not been seen in Norway before, so there is no reason to believe that it has been present in society for a long time.
This is probably something that has been introduced to the country recently, but it is necessary to be on high alert now. " said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdotter, specialist on the surveillance department of the Ministry of Health.
The majority of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
More samples are to be taken in the coming weeks, but some of those who were in contact with the infected have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now, there is no influenza epidemic, and there are fewer cases of other airborne diseases, so they are able to be a little more liberal with this., " said Kamilla.

Two of the infected were identified after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions about whether it is appropriate to hold such events.
The head of the Norwegian Ministry of Defense said that it is possible for as long as people follow the guidelines and regulations.
Kamilla says that it is almost impossible that the infected were infected at sporting events.
"If the number of people in isolation is not increased from these individuals after having been in contact with them at these sporting events, it can be claimed that their quarantine measures have been effective.
En það is not known, " said Kamilla.
The deployment of the armed forces is under constant scrutiny.
"They have to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if the situation warrants it. " said Kamilla.
After about a week, the number of people to be detained will be increased to 1,000.
This new position could have an impact on the relaxation of the rules.

Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle.
The municipal authorities in Seattle, the capital of the state of Washington, have declared a state of rebellion in the aftermath of the large--scale protests in the city center.
Police used tear gas and pepper spray to try to clear a large area that protesters had occupied and stretched over many houses in the neighborhood of the parliament building.
The police announced on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into damage caused to a police station in the city on the previous day,, possibly by a bomb.
Police and law enforcement authorities say that protesters threw stones, bottles, explosives and other loose objects at the police and one police officer was transported to a hospital where he was treated for injuries.
The protests in Seattle were, however, peaceful for a long time.
They were sent to Portland, Oregon to show that there was unity among the protesters, in the city, where there has been repeated confrontations between protesters and armed units of the state police.
There,, like in many cities in the United States, people gather together under the banner of Black Lives Matter and commemorate the death of George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on 25 May, and protest against the institutional racism in the American society.

Those who can vote on the agreement are employees of Icelandair who pay membership fees to the Flight Attendants' Association.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective agreement on the night of 19 July, after the airline terminated negotiations with the union in early July after flight attendants rejected a previous agreement in a vote.
Icelandair had dismissed all of its flight attendants and flight crew on Friday, but they were reinstated after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to the new contract, flight attendants have to fly five times more per month for the same salary.
The Kjarasamning agreement is valid until 2025, but there are agreements with flight attendants and flight attendants about how long they can fly on one shift.
The agreement was presented to the members of FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel the previous Monday and many of the flight attendants interviewed by the news agency were dissatisfied with the agreement.
Most of them agreed that it was necessary to accept the agreement in order to keep the federation alive.
Uppgjör for Icelandair for the second quarter will be announced in the morning, that the airline's operating profit, its revenue from fuel and taxes is negative by 100 to 110 million US dollars or 15 million Norwegian krones.
Icelandair sent the Court of Appeal a provisional revenue of 60 million Norwegian krones in the fourth quarter or 8.3 million Norwegian krones.
Handbært equipment and its equivalent have been worth 154 million US dollars at the end of the quarter, around 21 million Norwegian krones.

Icelandair is aiming to sign contracts with 15 airlines, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before the airline goes into a share sale.
A new variant of the virus rather than a new species of the virus.
"The new strain means that it was a person who came from abroad.
Þese are not the kind of infection that has been seen in Norway. " Már Kristiansen, head of the infectious diseases department at the National Hospital, says about the reports of " a new strain of the virus " in Norway.
Three domestic transmissions were detected and two at the border.
A person who was diagnosed had taken part in the social activities of a football club at a football tournament called the Rey Cup,, but the origin of the infection is unknown and the infection tracing is ongoing.
The disease was also found in a person who came to the country on 15 July, and two people who were in contact with him began to show symptoms of the disease.
In the day before, the infection was found to be related to the infection from the day before, and after genetic analysis at the Norwegian Institute of Genetics, a new strain of the virus was discovered that had not previously been found in Norway.
The transmission of the infection is completed in connection with the transmission of the infection.
Már states that it is not a new virus, that it is the same virus that has spread all over the world,, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS- CoV 2.
It is more accurate to talk about a new variant of the virus rather than a new species of the virus.
It is not clear what this means and it is not known whether it is the beginning of a new wave of the disease. Mår says that, as it is a single incident, it is not clear what it means and it is not known whether it is the beginning of a new wave of the disease.
"However, in the event of cases occurring within the country that are not related to foreign strains and are of the same genotype as this particular strain, it is possible to draw the conclusion that it is a second wave, but it is premature to do so at this time. "
Hamingjan in the hot pot.
The secret of the happiness of the Icelanders is hidden in the hot baths.
The BBC's daytime programme makers produced a short film that highlighted the popularity of swimming pools and saunas in the country.
Iceland's bathing culture is unique in the world and it is claimed that there are more bathing places per inhabitant than anywhere else in the world.
The natural heat of the earth is the basis of it, but also the tradition of using it.
In 1940, compulsory Sunday schooling for children was established, older citizens are also keen to use the hot water for their health.
Ferries are described as a fixed part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, they are all equal, without class and status.
The sea is not far away, people talk to each other on a personal level about home and abroad or enjoy the similar power of the waters, contemplate and recharge the soul and body.
It is a long way to get 100 days in the elections.
100 days are until the Americans go to the election and choose their president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re--election, but he is on the back foot.
Biden is ahead of Trump in the polls on a statewide basis, according to polling surveys.
According to a new survey by the Associated Press news agency, a large number of Americans believe that the country is heading in the wrong direction.
The response of Trump to the new coronavirus epidemic is also very unpopular and, in addition, more Americans than before believe that the president has mismanaged the economy.
Nine out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right path.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the outbreak and 48 percent say he has handled the economy well.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average of Five Thirty Eight, Biden has 49.9 percent of the vote nationally and 41.9 percent of the vote for Trump.
The President himself has tried to shift attention away from his failure in the face of the hurricane to the so-called " culture wars " and to promote policies based on laws and regulations.
Framboð Biden puts a lot of effort to keep the focus on Trump and believes that he has a great chance of winning if the election turns on the fact that he has done a good job in the last four years.
The popularity of Trump also seems to be affecting members of the Republican Party, and it is possible that the Democrats could gain a majority in the House of Representatives..
Politico said on the days that the party's and the candidate's popularity was similar and that the Republican Party would suffer its biggest decline in a century.
In the parliamentary elections of 2016, Uthverfi proved to be the worst constituency for the party,, and it is likely that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to frighten the inhabitants of the outlying areas to follow him,, among other things, by saying that if Biden becomes president, he would destroy the outlying areas of the United States and stir up racial conflicts.
Among other things, Trump has abolished a decree from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
Then he urged " housewives " in the outlying areas of the United States to read an article written by the former Secretary of State of New York, where she claimed that Biden would destroy the outlying areas of the United States and took Trump under it.
" Biden will destroy their neighborhoods and the American dream.
The President said that he would preserve it, and even make it better. "
The population of the outlying areas of the United States is constantly growing in the number of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
From 2004, when George W. Bush was re--elected,, the candidate with the most votes from this group has become president.
In 2012, Mitt Romney received more votes from this group than Barack Obama but lost to him.
Skoðanakannanir have shown that, despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the outlying areas in 2016, his popularity there has fallen dramatically.
Tho it var different between the candidates, Biden had a 15 percent advantage over Trump in the polls in the last few weeks.

The Olympic Games are the light at the end of the runway.
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, a sporting event that has only been affected by world wars,, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Games would be " the light at the end of the journey " and referred to the worldwide epidemic of the coronavirus that the world is going through in unity.
The athletes have an extra year to prepare and the Japanese authorities have increased their costs due to the postponement.
All of them hold their heads high, though they are in dire straits.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympic Games in 2008, the celebrations of the Japanese delegation were disrupted.
They shouted and shouted back and forth until the decision was made to hold the games in Tokyo in 2016, but this was overturned by the decision to hold the games in Rio in Brazil in 2016.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were in the limelight of the world.
The matches were scheduled to be played from 24 July to 9 August but were postponed for a year and started on 23 July 2011 and ended on 8 August 2011.
If it is not possible to hold the Games, if the coronavirus is still a threat, the Games will be cancelled.
No one wants to think it through to the end.
The Olympic Games are not the usual kind of athletic competition..
It is not to be spared, the show always has to be spectacular and try to top the previous one.
The choice of the host city for the Olympic Games is based on the assessment of the selection committee on the presentation of the cities.
The more spectacular the presentation is, the greater the likelihood of success.
Oslo was awarded 150 million Norwegian krones to try to hold the Olympics in 2016, equivalent to 20 million Norwegian krones.
In the second time,, when they applied for the 2020 Olympics, they spent 75 million dollars, 10 million Norwegian krones on the preparations.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the Games in 2012,, the Japanese government had allocated 30 million krone to the project.
En the amount is only a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of building the Olympic village, the venues and preparing the country to host the Games, and holding the Games themselves.
The organizers in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which had been scheduled to take place this year but had been postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 126 million dollars.
In a report from the state inspector in Japan that was released at the end of the year, however, it was revealed that the cost was nearly double that figure.
The cost of postponing the games is estimated to be in the range of two to six million dollars more than the original budget.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could be as high as 15 to 30 million dollars.
There are so high numbers that all of the revenue from the Norwegian government's contribution to the Olympic Games is only enough to cover about half of the total cost of the Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of study by economists, who have examined the impact of the games in terms of profit and benefit.
In short, it seems that many have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games on the economy of the cities that host them is not very positive.
The short- term effects are some,, for example, the number of jobs has increased dramatically in the short term, but in the longer term, cities often have a surplus of unused buildings and high operating costs.
The city of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, has large debts due to the 2016 Games and has struggled to maintain all of the large athletic facilities built for the Games.
10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
It means that no new jobs were created, only to a small extent.
In general, cities have not come out well financially from hosting the Olympics due to the high cost of building facilities for the games.
However, there is often considered to be an increase in the number of tourists visiting the Olympic host cities in the wake of the games,, but there is great uncertainty about the 2021 games.
It is also unclear whether it is possible to accommodate all of the large number of spectators who normally attend the games.
The main thing, however, is the honor of being chosen,, but it is difficult to assess it in terms of money.
In spite of the enormous cost, it is also possible to say that the joy that the actors bring is not of the same nature as that which can be placed on a scale.
In spite of the fact that the show is often spectacular and there is no shortage of money, it is not just about money.
It is the athletes who are in the foreground.
For some of the athletes, the postponement of the games is just a blessing.
The Australian pentathlon athlete and gold medalist in her event at the 2008 Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is a single and has been away from good form in the summer but hopes to be in competitive form for the 2012 Olympics.
She is one of the athletes who is more content with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after the Games, the postponement of the Games in some cases meant that they were forced to retire earlier than they had planned.
He does not trust his body to be able to go through another year of intense training..
Few athletes made themselves known to audiences at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio as the gymnast Simone Biles..
She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has met in several interviews in her home country of the United States to discuss the Olympic Games.
She intends to participate in the Olympics in 2021, but she is not sure that she would be on top of the podium at the Olympics in 2012, because she is now 24 years old.
Although it is not generally considered to be a high age, it is in a higher level for a female athlete in the first line.
"This is a sensitive issue, " Biles says, but smiles in a second interview with the Olympic Committee's website.
"She does not know whether she will be on top again after a year of training. "
She has previously said that her body is not able to handle the stress of competitive gymnastics for a long time.
She is still competing for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles says that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop training suddenly when the recession was at its peak and the gymnastics hall was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles as opposed to other athletes while all athletic facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold medals could not be sold, she had to find various ways to keep herself in shape like other athletes.
The basic form is, in fact, slightly better than with most people.
"They have a strict schedule now..
It was difficult to start training again after the gymnastics hall was opened again.
I started slowly but is coming on full throttle in 2014 and will increase his training as the year progresses.
I know for sure that these actors will be or that they will be held, but they are rehearsed based on the assumption that they will be held,, but they are rehearsed based on the assumption that they will be held.
He has put too much pressure on himself to quit the sport now. "
With her and others, there is a feeling of uncertainty about the possibility of the games being held in 2021 rather than 2020.
It is impossible to predict what will happen in the future.
In July 2021, the situation of the world's epidemic of the coronavirus is unknown, and there is no other way than to prepare for the Olympic Games based on the assumption that they would be held in 2012.
It is possible that the Olympic Stadium is the light at the end of the Covid gang..
The wedding was postponed due to the plague.
The Modern Family actor Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams in the summer.
The actress said in an interview with People, "I think there are other more important things to think about at the moment..
"They want to get married to each other at some point and have a dream wedding and have all the guests who are dear to them.
I decided to postpone it and focus on what is important at the moment and that is to help spread information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
He is more interested in world affairs than marriage at the moment.
There is a lot going on and attention should be directed to what is happening in the world.
