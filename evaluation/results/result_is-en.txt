Hrópaed at home.
The marketing campaign "Looks Like You Need Iceland " has gone well off the ground and shouting and shouting can be heard far and wide in the wilderness of the world.
"I have a broken heart, I need Iceland " is said by a woman in the far reaches of the world in a comment on the advertisement from the marketing campaign " Looks Like You Need Iceland " on the YouTube channel.
The second viewer says that he will keep Iceland in his heart forever and a young woman says that she will come to Iceland first because her husband is living there.
She is now in the United States and plans to stay there for a few months..
One of the spectators asks whether the way to Iceland is open, because there are no airplanes.
It is not known whether he comes from another time belt.
Egill Þordarson from the advertising company Peel, who was involved in the production of the advertisements together with the international advertising company M and C Saatchi, says that the response to the advertisements has exceeded expectations.
" He has been inspired by many of the Iceland campaigns that have been very successful but the new campaign is already breaking records.
In essence, it is about creating publicity for the campaign, that is achieved by getting foreign newspapers to write about it,, and this has gone very well.
In a relatively short period of time, they have received coverage in more than 700 newspapers and magazines around the world, reaching more than 2 million people.
The value of the coverage is estimated at 180 million Norwegian krones.
Það is not amalegt.
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has gone well there, despite the fact that the United States is not a member of the European Union.
According to Egil, known markets such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also taken well to it, as well as Russia, which came as a pleasant surprise.
This has led to reactions from distant areas,, such as India,, which was not specifically mentioned.
" These advertisements have been viewed by more than four million people on YouTube. " according to Egill.
"They had not been able to ask for a better start. "
These pictures were taken by photographer Arni Sæberg during the filming of advertisements with the slogan " Let It Out " in mid- the last month.
The tunnels went far and wide,, such as on the Skølavørdstig in Reykjavik, at Reynisfjør near Skøgarfoss, at Sølheimajøkli and in a cave at Hjörleifshøfda.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Pall Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cameraman was Óttar Guðnason.
In the roles of these characters, were the Irish actress Anna Jia and the German actor Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
The Icelandic crew worked on the making of the advertisements, at the same time as filming took place in southern Norway, while another group was filming in western Norway and the Westfjords.
According to Egils, " Let It Out " is only the first part of the " Looks Like You Need Iceland " campaign, and that a winter campaign is planned in collaboration with M & C Saatchi.
"This is only the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Film Commission,, says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M and C Saatchi has gone very well.
"It's fantastic to work with them.
In such projects, it is crucial to have a foreign partner with knowledge of the markets they are talking about.

She became famous for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in the series Sabrina the Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is 49 years old, married with one child.
She has not been in the limelight for a long time, but she appeared on Australian television to talk about the film Clueless in the days before.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
"I had to admit that he built the character mostly on girls he met in school who were not good to him..
In the process of reading the script, he knew that this character was. " said Donovan about his role in Clueless.
I didn't want to leave the police station after the night patrol.
The police received 50 cases in the capital area on the same day and in the police's daily report, it says that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station in Hverfisgåte started with the police having to intervene in a man who had been released from the prison after being detained there due to drunken driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man was sentenced to continued detention at the police station because of his actions.
In the morning, a man was arrested on suspicion of breaking into a company in Kópavog.
The police also had to intervene in two men in Breiðholt due to reports of physical assaults.
In addition, a woman who was eating at a restaurant in Kópavog was not able to pay for her meal at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.
It was also announced that a car was stolen in the center of the city in the morning.
The captain of the white Renault transport plane took her away for a short time and she was then taken by force.
The plane has not been found.

Sú kenning has achieved flight on the Internet because the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California and became the third leading actor of the series to die prematurely.
The series about the Glee choir is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The series focused on a group of young students at a high school, their love affairs and their destiny.
It was not always taken with joy to be in the choir, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the series managed to overcome the circumstances that arose in their lives.
is =In the absence of the shooting locations, the actors and crew members of the films have suffered a great tragedy, to the extent that rumors have emerged about the poisoning of the films.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santonu Lopez in the episode, the mother who did not call all her children.
After the series ran its course, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and they had their first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they split up as a result.
Dorey refused to file a complaint and the domestic abuse case was dropped.
Þann 8th July last year, it was announced that Rivera was missing after her four--year old son was found alone on a boat in Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a lifeboat on board the ship and was able to report to the police that he and his mother had jumped into the water and were rescued by Rivera, but never returned to the ship.
The search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the police chief of the area announced that it was believed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was officially declared dead.
It is believed that she fell into a strong current in the water and used her last breaths to save her son.
The cause of death was drunkenness from an accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Glee choir to prominence.
Outside of the shows, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he struggled with addiction and it was difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his colleagues in the series were tired of him and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith went into treatment and appeared to be on the road to recovery.
Only two months after he finished treatment, Moneith was found dead in his hotel room after going out to celebrate with friends..
The poison was a mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not believed that it was an act of will.
Moneith had been in treatment and his tolerance for drugs had decreased so much that a substance he had previously tolerated well proved to be lethal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
The death of his co---star, Lea Michele, led to the decision to continue the series and dedicate the entire season to the memory of Moneith and his character, Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah " Puck " Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American football player, similar to Finn, and had little respect for the other members of the Glee choir until he realized that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of child pornography.
During a search of his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found and the case became public.
Ljóst was that Salling was finished.
He was in the wake of being charged and convicted for his crimes.
He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison, he also had to be placed on a list of sex offenders and had to undergo treatment for child abuse.
Before the judge had decided on the punishment, Salling, who had been released from custody, was found near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors in the series who fell away long before they reached old age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the episodes.
He died suddenly in his sleep in 2013, at the age of 41.
I also won a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the star Julia Roberts and her sister's story was not as glamorous as hers, she accused her sister of being a domineering figure and a bad mother.
Motes died in 2014 but she struggled with severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her husband, in which she said that her mother and sisters were responsible for her misfortune.
"Mom and her so--called siblings have nothing after him except the memory of his worst depression. "
She was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying her co--stars on the set of the film and having an overbearing star attitude.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged for drunken driving in 2019, which was considered a huge scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
She became a victim of this in 2010 when she was photographed naked and the pictures were posted on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played in both episodes and had a love affair outside of the series.
In 2010, Jenner accused Benoist of abusing her during their relationship.
Það is possible to put flowers on almost everything.
It enhances the development of children when they play out in the garden with their parents to cultivate flowers and watch them grow and develop.
Það is also possible to make with flowers, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
It's only the fact of having time with the children in the garden that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and the fact that they had a good time with their parents.
I bought a boat after the 10th grade.
"There are not many sailors who work in the kindergartens of the country " says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who works as a fisherman during the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.
Coastal fishing is a very pleasant summer job when one is in school.
If the fishing is good, it is possible to have good income and it is good that it is possible to drop the school..
Tekjurnar duga him well in the winter as well, " says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, 25-year old psychology student, who has been engaged in coastal fishing in the summer as well as in previous summers.
Axel arrived at the dock in Tålknafjør late in the evening of the first day of the week when he was interviewed by a newspaper reporter.
"The year he was in tenth grade, he took the captain's license for boats under 12 meters and bought his own boat the summer after graduating from high school.
He has been fishing from his boat all summer..
He bought the boat from a friend, named Hartmann Jonsen, and he named the boat after him.
Hartmann was already an adult when he bought the boat and had stopped sailing, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after Axel took over the ship, and he bought the ship for three million Norwegian krones.
" He made a contract with Hartmann to pay half of the money in the beginning of the summer and the other half in the end of the summer when he had finished fishing.
He owned the boat free of debt at the end of his first summer on it.
In other words, a boy who had just finished high school was able to earn one and a half million to buy out a boat..
" He had been working with his father on the sea when he was a boy, he had been working with his father on the sea when he was a boy and he received his share.
He also put his confirmation money into his own sailing fund.
Axel was born in Ísafjörð, where all his mother's family is from, but he has lived in Kópavog since he was a child.
" He can fish in the west of the country because he has a residence permit with his grandmother in Ísafjörð.
He learned the area on the west coast of Norway with his father by rowing.
He travels from one fjord to another depending on how he feels, because the fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although he feels that he is best suited to fishing in the west of the country, he has also fished in the area around the island of Snaefell and further afield.
I have also fished in the south, where the most common fish is the seabird. Axel, who always goes fishing early in the morning, says that he sometimes talks to the seabirds and sings to the sky in the early hours of the day.
"Netsambandið out at sea is good, so he can listen to radio broadcasts and music.
It is not a problem to be alone on a boat.
I have tried to avoid getting into trouble, but there have been occasions when the weather has been unfavourable, but he is lucky because he is not sea sick..
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes.
"In fishing, he is never more than 14 hours at sea in one day,, but he has also been on fishing expeditions in other areas,, for example in the lease quota,, but he has been out at sea for one and a half days at a time. "
The arrangement for coastal fishing is such that he is allowed to catch 770 kilograms a day, which he finds unsatisfactory.
"Other restrictions are that he can not fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and that he can only fish for 12 days a month during the four months of stranded fishing in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to roam instead of having 48 days over the entire summer and being able to roam freely..
Svo, the division of the area could also take place in the same way, and that the fishing harbors that are well situated in the fishing areas would be able to benefit from this. Axel, who mainly fishes with salmon from the sea on his coastal fishing trips, but also a small amount of herring and some other species also float with it.
Axel works through the winter with his university studies at the Nupi school in Kópavog..
" He is proud and adds that he only intended to work temporarily at the leikskol..
"He stayed there because he felt it was an amazing job.
He hopes that the psychology degree will be useful to him in his studies at the secondary school in the future, " says Axel, who is also well advanced in his studies in economics.

The villa in the list of people who come to the country was created because one person who was living in the country was not called back for a re-examination.
There is no obligation to write the name of the person on the envelope if it is written in English, as is the case when it is written in Icelandic.
"It will be examined in the coming week, " says a specialist in the field of disease prevention at the Ministry of Health.
Three domestic transmissions were detected in the virology department of the Landspitals in the previous day.
Einn of those who proved to be positive arrived in the country on the 15th of July, two days after the regulation of the so-called immigrants' homecoming gate took effect.
Those who were living on the island were screened upon their arrival to the country and again four to five days later.
Fram said in the morning news of RTU that he had followed the old system.
He was not called back for a second screening for the virus. the border screening was negative and he was not called back for a second screening for the virus.
In a conversation with the news agency, Kamilla Rut Sigfusdottir, a specialist in the immunization department of the Ministry of Health, said that this could be traced back to a flaw in the electronic registration passport.
Fylli fólk up the registration sheet in English is not a requirement to put in the name like in the Icelandic version.
Enda, it was first and foremost intended for foreign tourists.
The person in question had not been invited to take part in the selection process.
Kamilla says that many have followed the rules about homecomings, although they have filled the registration forms in English and in some cases, the employers have also been aware of sending people back for a second check..
"This will be examined in the week, how it is possible to make it easier for people to gain access to this, to attract attention to it. "
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in solitary confinement.
They all underwent a medical examination, two of them had already shown symptoms..
Smitrakning is in progress with the three smits that were discovered on the day before, but it is mostly finished due to the two smits that were discovered on the day before.
In both cases, DNA analysis by the Institute of Genetics at the University of Oslo revealed that they were different strains of the coronavirus that had not previously been found in Norway.
In the other case, the bonds have been directed to Iceland, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it would be clear on the next day where the infection was coming from.
There are now 15 people in isolation according to the web.
135 are in quarantine.
Fjögur of five infections are unrelated.
Five domestic transmissions have been detected in Norway in the past days.
The four are completely unrelated and have not been traced back to the outbreak at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in 2010.
Smitrakning is still ongoing.
The original 30 were sentenced to solitary confinement but were reduced to 16.
In total, 34 people are in quarantine due to the new infections that were discovered the day before.
It is the second time in a short time that a case of infection has been detected at an athletic event and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
He says that it is possible as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
" They are constantly urging all those who live in the country to maintain individual sexually transmitted disease prevention.
They also have to emphasize to people who are organizing events that there are certain rules that have to be followed..
Þá it is possible to organize events. " says Jóhann.
He says that it is possible to prevent the spread of infection with the use of individual protection measures.
Regulations and guidelines are being reviewed on a regular basis.
"The thing that has to be done, and that the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health are constantly urging people to do,, is to take care of these individual- specific sexually transmitted infections.
Bæði at home and abroad and at the same time at the service company.
People wash their hands and use sprit.
Það prevents the spread of the infection. " he says.
"They need to emphasize to people to continue on the good path they were on, to maintain the achievements they have achieved so far. "
40 % of the victims of the disease were suffering from syphilis 2.
Devon Brumfield heard through the telephone how difficult it was for her father to breathe.
Her father was suffering from syphilis and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was buried.
Andlati was racked by sudden respiratory difficulties due to the coronavirus infection.
Sickness was recorded on the death certificate as the underlying cause and Brumfield, who is also suffering from sykursyke, is deathly afraid of going to prison.
The Reuters news agency says that Brumfield's fears are unreasonable.
The results of a new survey carried out by US authorities showed that nearly 40% of those who died were suffering from syphilis 2, which is the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those under 65 years of age is considered, the proportion rises to half.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) took to more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus during the period from February to May.
The results are stunning, especially for those who have syphilis and their partners.
It was found that the rate of growth was slow in the 12 countries that responded to similar proportions.
10 states, among which are California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet separated from underlying diseases.
"Sickness was when the epidemic was in its early stages.
Now, the disease has broken out like a powerful storm, " according to Reuters, Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Syphilis is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also been affected more severely by the viral infection.
The best defense for those with syphilis 2 is to keep the disease in check with physical exercise, a healthy diet, and the assistance of health professionals.
The coronavirus epidemic has, however, made it difficult for many to maintain routine.
In the meantime, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue to work in order to avoid being exposed to the virus..
Reuters reports that American authorities were aware of the possibility of the disease being transmitted by the virus.
In 2003, more than 20% of those affected by SARS had the disease, and in the swine flu outbreak of 2009, this group was three times more likely to be admitted to hospitals.
When MERS became more prevalent in 2012, a study showed that 60 percent of those who died or were hospitalized had syphilis.
The effect of the COVID 19 virus may be longer than that of other diseases, that has stripped the veil from a number of previously unknown follow-up diseases.
"He fears that there will be a flood of sycursyke victims when this is over. "
Doctors have warned that the epidemic could indirectly lead to an increase in syphilis- related complications, such as nephrosyphilis and nephropathy.
There are new research on the possibility that the coronavirus could lead to an increase in syphilis cases.
The scientists are trying to understand the connection between the coronavirus and syphilis 2.
The virus affects the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weakened in people with syphilis.
This means that a high proportion of glucose and lipids in the cells of those with syphilis can cause a genuine " cellular storm " as it is called when the body's immune system reacts too strongly.
Damaged intracellular membranes can also lead to the formation of bubbles, which in turn can lead to the formation of blood clots.
"It's all one big puzzle, " says Dela Cruz.
"This is connected to all of them. "
Fréttin has been corrected.
"They were offered camp wine, then they left the room. "
The couple, Åsrún Magnusdottir and Atli Bollason were given the unusual honor from the filmmaker Ragnar Kjartansen to have sex in front of the camera for a film that the filmmaker was working on in Paris.
"They loved each other so much that it was not complicated. "
Atli Bollason never forgets when he meets his wife and mother-in law, Åsrúun Magnúsdottir, for the first time.
" He was very impressed by her.
It was natural that it was just radiation, but she also thought that she was very attractive.
Og þykir enn, " he says.
The 40--year old Aarsun has been married to her first husband for 10 years, and has been married to her second husband for 10 years.
"He hears this story all the time.
Síðast bara over the weekend, " she said that she fell in love with her husband at first sight.
"Mér fannst and still feels that there is a great amount of tension around Atla,, which he likes..
There are a lot of things going on and a lot of things are happening, and he was fascinated by this..
Atli says that the couple have emphasized their own paths in their relationship.
"They do not tie the ropes of their boats with the same knots as their fellow sailors.
In the past, they avoided routines that they perceived in the surroundings.
It is possible that this was the reason for the enthusiastic reception of the Ragnar Kjartansen artist's initiative,, even though it was far from the norm.
"Kirstine Anna, a common friend of theirs has contacted them and asked if they could come to dinner with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg, at Snap. "
They accepted the invitation and met the three princes at Snap and received dessert wine and each of them one after the meal.
They listened to Ragnar as he led them through his plans for an exhibition of his paintings at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
"He had a video work called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it in a simple way.
Ásrún says that he described the incident as a banal and decadent scene from the daily life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he wanted to shoot, and lastly he told them that he wanted to know whether they had an interest in participating. "
Senan, Ragnar's assistant, was the one who came up with the idea to show young middle class couples falling in love in a minimalistic apartment..
"This is a relationship with a beginning and an end,, " says Atli.
Parið þekkted Ragnar little, though they had known of him and he of them " but they knew them and felt they fit the role.
They said that they did not want to advertise for people.
It is possible that they thought that they would not get the right people, rather people who had sex with each other because they were performing for others..
They sent Ragnar away and agreed to discuss the matter, but it took a long time.
"When they walked out of Snap, they said, " They are not only in this. "
This was just like that.
I trusted Ragnar as a musician and all of his team, " says Ásrún and Atli.
"It's about love and closeness. "
Senan was taken up in a fine apartment in the Mýrargotten.
There was a very small film crew, the director Ragnar, the cameraman and the soundman.
After the fire was lit, all of the rooms were evacuated to wait outside in the car, except for Atli and Ásrún.
"They had not decided what they wanted to do.
They received some instructions, but they tried to forget time and place.
To be unaware of what they were doing and for whom.
Það was not played, they only loved each other so it was not complicated. says Åsrún.
En was romantic.
"It was a little romantic, " says Atli and Åsrún agrees.
"They were offered champagne before they left the room..
It was like being on holiday in a luxury hotel in Paris.
The team was pleased with the pair's performance in the play that moved them.
"When Tommi looked at it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful. " says Atli.
"It's as much about love and closeness and their own relationships with each other " says Åsrún.
The parents have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice of the son at the National Theatre in Reykjavik and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to think about it " says Atli.
"Mamma and dad saw it in Paris.
I didn't say this to anyone, but he sent a letter to his father and said " It was fun to meet the little family in the Palais de Tokyo. "
Og it is believed that the participation in the play has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atle.
"We are still together, it may have deepened a little.
Þetta deepened his relationship with his extended family, " says Åsrún and laughs.
Sjalf was in Kaupmannahöfen with his colleagues.
"It was a little difficult to be away from him rather than someone else. " she says and turns to her husband.
"It was fun to see it, because it is only one scene in a larger work, and when it is seen with the other works, it is very attractive.
I was able to break away from this and was proud.
Og there was a little baby in her stomach at the time,, says Åsrún, who was pregnant with her second child at the time of the incident.
"It was beautiful. "

Ambassador without a country for five years from 2009.
Jeffery Gunter Ross, the American ambassador to Ireland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported in the morning that he wanted to have armed bodyguards because he feared for his life.
It has not been easy for the President of the United States to send ambassadors to Norway.
From April 2009, when Carol Van Voorst resigned as ambassador to the United States,, the country has been without an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
In 2009, Kastljos revealed that she had been nominated for the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the Order of the
On the way to the farewell ceremony with the President of Norway, she received a telephone call from the President's office that she would not be awarded the honor.
After she left Iceland, she became acquainted with international relations at the Army War College.
It took six months to find a replacement for Van Voorst, when he left in September 2010.
It can be attributed to some extent to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador, then resigned.
He had worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for more than a decade.
He resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador in Guatemala.
He then took up a second term as ambassador.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015 and took up his post shortly after,, with no ambassador having been stationed in the country for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but was not a diplomat, and had worked as a lawmaker and fundraiser for Barack Obama.
He resigned as ambassador to the United States on 20 January 2017 when Donald Trump took over as president, as is usual with a diplomatic ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusually long in appointing both ambassadors and high--ranking officials in the government in Washington.
It took two years for the United States Congress to appoint Jeffrey Ross Gunter as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the parliament, he said that he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, and that his wife, who died, was of Norwegian descent.
Gunter is politically appointed and was previously a physician in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The owner of the Spilavit company, Sheldon Adelson, founded the group, but Adelson is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter was sent to Iceland in May 2019, after there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months.
The reason for this is both the length of time it took for Trump to appoint people to key positions, and the length of time it took to confirm ambassadors.
Since 2009, there has been no ambassador in Norway. for five years.
It has, however, not hindered the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which opened new headquarters at Engjateig in 2008.
The construction is estimated to have cost around 65 million euros, the building is surrounded by a 1.000- meter (3,300 ft) thick wall of reinforced concrete and bulletproof glass is used in all the windows.
It seems that the current ambassador does not have enough confidence because he is said to fear for his life and has asked for armed protection.
The former player of ÍBV was subjected to racism in Norway - "It was a mistake to come to Norway "
Tonnay Mawejje, a former player of ÍBV, said that he was subjected to racism when he was in Norway and that he regrets coming to Norway.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny, which was published in the Ugandan newspaper Daily Monitor.
He went to the Uganda Police Football Club, which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In an interview with the Daily Monitor, he talks about many things, including his time in Norway, he played with IBV, Val and Throtti in Norway.
"When he came to Iceland, he did not play in the middle as he was used to,.
Fyrirliði of the team was in that position, but he also had a jersey number that he wanted,, which he did not get. "Tone says that he played on the right side of the field during the season with ÍBV.
Among other things, Tonny talks about racism that he experienced in Norway.
He says this is a problem for many black players when they play in Europe.
"This happened to him once,, but because he did not understand the language, he ignored everything that was said to him..
I later learned of the matter and then asked his friend what the matter was about.
He said that his opponent had made racist remarks about him after he took him down.
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He says that he has made the mistakes that he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to get himself in the starting lineup of Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get a place in the national team.
Þá he asked him to go back to Ireland on loan, he then went to join Val.
"It was a mistake to return to Iceland on loan.
Eg held that if he had been in Norway for longer, he would have received the opportunities he wanted. Tonny said that he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would be able to go further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has made it impossible for him to fulfill his dreams of playing in a big team in Europe.
A worm was found in the neck of a woman.
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 inch long black worm in the throat of the woman.
The fishermen managed to drag the whale out with a pole.
Research led to the conclusion that it was a parasitic infection.
The news is from CNN.
Kona had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman quickly recovered after the tapeworm was removed, but tapeworms like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi became popular in Western countries, cases of parasitic insects infecting humans have increased, according to CNN.
I fear that a second wave is about to start in Europe.
In the wake of concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, Spain has taken action to halt the spread of the new outbreak.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but it is more widespread in other cities where the disease is spreading.
The other European countries have also taken action in response to the spread of the infection in Spain, but in Britain all those returning from Spain have to go into quarantine, like in Norway and France, and the French have been warned against travelling to Spain.
Smitum is also on the increase in France and Germany, where the government is trying to find a balance between restricting the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
The situation in Europe is, however, good compared to other parts of the world, and the number of new infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 per day, with the highest number of new infections in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide, with 644,000 deaths attributed to the virus.
Mosaic work by Gerðar is finally allowed to reach its full potential.
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavik there is a large and deep hole.
There are men with orange helmets on the top of the hill..
There is also a large grave.
and a number of smaller work vehicles.
The road is closed for traffic.
The gangstead is wide and there are many who stand there and admire the millions of mosaic tiles - similar to what they have never seen before..
It is possible that they had never seen it before.
At the least, he did not see it for himself.
It has until now been somewhat hidden,, in front of it were parking spaces that were always occupied.
People left the car in a hurry and rushed off to their assignments in the city center.
"Lively and diverse public space " and " an attractive cityscape " are the guiding lights of the reconstruction of the Tryggvagate.
The goal is to improve the appearance of the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerda Helgadottir at the Toll House to be seen better.
In front of the work, a square is built and the area where the road runs well with the sun is thought to be suitable as a rest area for travellers.
The sculpture is lit up and is now able to show its features more clearly on the 142 square metres of the site.
In the area, there are also small " water sculptures ", which offer play and provide the area with a certain mysticism.
In this way, the renovations are described by the municipality of Reykjavik as being carried out in conjunction with Veitums.
Lagnir for water, heat and electricity are to be rebuilt.
In 1925, the school plant and the cold water plant were built. they have therefore served the inhabitants and companies in the middle of the city for nearly a century.
When the road is reopened after the completion of the works, cars can be driven on it again.
She is, however, a one--way street, and as a result, there are more peaceful and accessible spaces for pedestrians..
The Toll House was inaugurated in 1971, and the architect was Gisli Halldorsson.
Due to the harbor flooding reaching through the house, there were 250 square meters of windowless wall in front of the street.
The construction committee and the architect agreed that such a flat surface would have a negative impact on the overall image of the city, unless special measures were made to enhance the appearance of the buildings.
The parties agreed that they would erect a permanent monument there.
At this time, there was a lot of talk about Gerði Helgadottir, artist, in the compilation..
She had worked extensively in mosaic art in Germany and other countries.
Arafarid was the first to have contact with her before deciding whether a competition would be held for the work.
Often discussions had been made about the need to reflect the life of the harbor in the film, as the harbor had been the life of Reykjavik since it was built.
When the artist was interviewed, she was overwhelmed by the work.
She had to come to an agreement that she would receive sketches and other assistance before she left the country,, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður received the time she wanted, and when she returned home, she put forward a number of proposals for discussion.
It was unanimously agreed to ask her to work on the project.
At the same time, she was asked to make a joint agreement with the famous sculpture company in Germany, the Oidtmann brothers,, with whom she had long worked on the reconstruction of famous sculptures in various parts of Europe.
The contract was signed and Gerður won the contract for the construction of the Toll House.
All the work was carried out exceptionally well, by both Gerða Helgadottir and the Oidtmann brothers. it says in the summary.
It has withstood the storms of the Irish weather since then.
It took Gerði two years to finish the work, which was completed in 1972 and 1973.
She died two years after the completion of the tollhouse, at the age of 47.
It is preparing to move more institutions out to the countryside.
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the
This said by the minister in the program Sprengisand on Bylgjunni in the afternoon.
The fire prevention department of the Housing and Building Agency will be moved to Sauðarøy in autumn..
The firefighting experts at the agency work at the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency to the north, and the National Association of Firefighting and rescue helicopter pilots have criticized the evacuation flights.
"He believes that they should take further steps in this situation.
He is preparing for further steps in this situation.
" More flights " said Åsmundur..
He says that he is convinced that the vast majority of the population wants more regional distribution of public institutions.
"He held that further political decisions about the relocation of public jobs outside the country were necessary,, such as the relocation of the Housing and Building Agency to Selfoss and the relocation of the Land Mapping Agency to Akranes and the relocation of the unemployment agency to Skagastrand.
All the major events from the second day of the World Championships.
The 94th IAAF World Athletics Championships ended at Thorsvål in Akureyri on the day.
A number of new records were set on the second day of competition.
It was expected to be a competitive competition in the women's javelin throw at Thorsvållen, as Vigdís Jonsdottir from FH set the Norwegian record in the event in 2014, which stood until May 2015, when Elisabet Rut Runarsdottir from ÍR broke the record.
Vigdís won back the national record earlier in the summer and has been in fantastic form in the second half of the season, and she has improved the national record three times during the season.
Elisabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and did not play in the match.
She had only one good throw of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the furthest in the competition, 60.08 meters in her final attempt, setting the meet record.
Her previous record of 62.69 metres was set earlier in July and she was far short of it.
Guðrún Karitas Hallgrimsdottir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day but improved her best with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's competition, the FH athlete, Hilmar Örn Jónsson, won with an easy victory by throwing 73.84 meters in his last throw and setting a new competition record.
His national record in the event is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic athlete and national champion in the discus throw, competed in the discus throw at Thorsvål in the previous day and competed in the javelin throw in the next day, which is his main event.
The record of Guðna Vals is 65.53 meters, he threw the longest 59.13 meters in the day and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the furthest in the day, he had one good throw of 49.43 meters that placed him in second place.
Hafdís Sigurðardotttir, Iceland's long jump champion, won the long jump competition with an outstanding performance by jumping 6.25 meters, which is just short of 40 centimeters from her national record.
In the women's 200 metre race, it was ÍR athlete Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadottir who was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds but her national record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri, she won two gold medals in the 100 metre sprint and in the 4 x 100 metre relay, and also in the 4 x 400 metre relay in the day.
In the men's competition, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200 metre sprint with a time of 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Oliver Mána Samúelssen from Årmann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna won gold in both the 100 and 400 metre sprints the previous day.
Fær no punishment for 27 million krone Bitcoin harvest.
Yfirskattanefnd has rejected the claim of the Chief Inspector of Police, who demanded the seizure of a man for failing to report his income as a result of the sale of Bitcoin.
Nefndin comes to the conclusion that the Chief Inspector of Police did not have a clear rationale for arresting the man.
In the verdict of the committee, it is stated that the tax inspector believed that the man had violated the tax law because of his income in the years 2016 and 2017.
Henn had overestimated her profits from the sale of her Bitcoin business to 27 million krones, either intentionally or due to gross negligence.
The man was sentenced for his behaviour.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
He went ahead with the idea of selling rafmynt for 27 million in 2016.
In the years 2009 and 2010, Hana had acquired him with a greftri,, which was both easy and cheap with a normal home computer..
He pointed out that when he sold the rafmyntina, the tax for such a sale had been unclear and unforeseeable.
It was not possible to anticipate that ordinary citizens would become aware of such arrangements in the allocation of taxes.
He had not intended to avoid paying the tax on the harvest and had made clear his ownership of the property on the register as a deposit on an account.
He had tried to persuade both experts and the Director of the Royal Mint about the matter, but without success.
He considered that it was necessary to take account of the fact that he was neither born nor raised in Ireland and had only lived in the country for a few years when he started digging for gold.
He had therefore been in a worse position than others to understand the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion on.
The man believed that the judgement of the two income years was to be reassessed and that punishment was to be imposed on him, but that otherwise he would not be punished.
He repeated that he was working in Norway and had paid taxes in Norway since 2012.
He had never intended to escape from his obligations in a disreputable manner.
Krafan against the sect was widespread and would throw him into debt.
" This man knows what football is about. "
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been widely criticized for his behavior towards people and has also received praise for his performance with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max division.
Blikar will be in the firing line in the evening when they take on ÍA in a live broadcast on Stød 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is banned from playing for four games due to four warnings during the season and will not play with a new haircut as he did in the games of the season so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla " on the top of his head for the match against HK the previous Friday, which HK won 1 – 0.
"He didn't know exactly who he was paying, but he was talking about character, that he was a better player in the game.
He did not go into hiding.

"I will be there for the people. "
"It is sometimes difficult to figure out what position he is in.
Hjörvar Hafliðason said: " He starts to move out to the left when the game begins,, but he has a very free role in the team. "
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says that Brynjolf is a real entertainer and that it is good to have him in the league. "There is no disagreement about the fact that he is a character.
This is a fun personality and he likes to wear his hair and he is always ready to meet and respond in interviews.
It is unbelievable that many people are fascinated by him, which indicates that this man knows what football is.
" He is a comedian.
I's to be there for the people and have fun with it.
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólf and people are paying in and watching what comes next on his hair.
Þessi man is a genius, " said Máni.
The player of KR says he wants to leave the club - " He has been in contact with several teams in the second division. "
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in the Pepsi Max division, seems to be on his way out of the team.
According to the Danish newspaper Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Fótbolti.net also reported on the case..
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country,, but first he has to terminate his contract with KR, as the Danish league starts earlier than the Norwegian one.
Félagið veit that he misses Denmark and has shown him a lot of understanding,, said Tobias in an interview with Bold.
" He has been in contact with a number of teams in the second division and is likely to move to another team before the end of the Norwegian season.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay the salary of his contract with KR.
He says that he will have to take a salary cut in Denmark.
"Félags in Denmark have probably found more for the economic effects of the virus than in Iceland. "
Hjolviseur Bjartmar has recovered millions of hjol for the newspaper DV. and now he is facing the newspaper for the first time.
In the past year, Bjartmar Leósson has had an interest that is different from most others.
Henn þefar up and rescues lost and stolen riding horses, racing horses, carriages and vehicles.
He has earned the nickname " the Hitchhiker " for his wanderings.
In the past,, there was a great flock of birds when the man told his story about his relationship with Bjartmar..
Vísaed DV that Bjartmar had spoken to the man on the streets of Oslo and said that he might have been stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the pilot, other than that Bjartmar had stolen him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the beginning of the original DV report has been altered in accordance with it.
Bjartmar says that the original reports of the incident were not accurate for what actually happened in the morning of the 15th of August in the area of Austervelt.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from the victim of a rape victim that these were indeed his rape victims.
The information he received from the alleged owner was false, Bjartmar says.
"He saw the cows and he recognized the skutlana, and ended up with information about a rafskutlana that had been missing for a long time and that had been searched for.
I hesitated for a moment, but when he saw that he was preparing to take off in a helicopter, he decided to confront the man..
The owner was convinced of his innocence and decided to have a conversation with the man.
Almennt, he goes very well in such matters,, but before he managed to complete what he had to say, the man had taken away his words..
Bjartmar says that the man on the helicopter offered him to show him the ticket for the helicopter and called the police himself.
"Já, flott, " said Bjartmar, " few get it straight. "
The owner of the helicopter proved his ownership of the helicopter and took off.
The owner of the helicopter told his story on Facebook, like in the first report..
I the short period of time that Bjartmar has been engaged in this activity, he says that he has been able to count the number of times that he has been involved in fights with people on the other side.
"He has had friendly relations with the most difficult men of Reykjavik,, he said, and pointed to the fact that bicycle racers are often the smallest brothers and sisters of society, fighters, disabled people and other people who live on the streets.
"Fíknin is a harsh landlord and, unfortunately, theft is easy on these loose funds. Bjartmar says.
" His relations with these people are so good that he has brought many of these good people along with him.
Dæmi are of people going into treatment and taking it on and then seeking help from him and assisting him with what he is doing. " he says.
In general, Bjartmars' interactions with horseback riders are on a courteous basis.
Some people know of him and what he is doing and are willing to give him a passport and registration number for his bicycle..
Horse theft is a major problem that has been neglected.
ennfremur, Bjartmar says that the police have started to tell people to talk to him because of stolen horses.
Bjartmar is not satisfied with the earlier reports of DV and says that he is not a self--appointed police officer in the pursuit of justice.
He is asked whether he is not yet fully on the ice with his actions, and that this is first and foremost the role of the police. Bjartmar says.
"The police are obliged to do this,, but the reality of the situation is that the police are not doing it.
He has, among other things, observed police officers driving away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She is completely innocent in these matters.
"When the police are not doing anything in this, and it is only in front of his nose, and experience has shown that he has achieved success in this matter,, he says.
I says that he has achieved so much success in catching stolen horses on the streets that he sometimes meets his " shelterers " on the streets, that they have only Bjartmari's horse that they had previously stolen.
Þau times that Bjartmar has called on the police for help have been times when she has not been able to meet him.
"This is not working with the police, and it is not the police's fault and it is not the owners of the horse carriers' fault in this case. " said Bjartmar and it is believed that the victims of horse carriage theft suffer because the police are incompetent in this case.
Bjartmars's achievements are not disputed.
Widespread is the belief that Bjartmari was able to recover his property from the Vikings.
Sjálfur says Bjartmar has long since lost count of the number of horses he has given away, but the amount is estimated to be in the millions, if not in the tens of millions.
Vega there jet engines, jet planes and heavy jet planes, but jet planes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works until the end of the day at a school and every other week he works at a commune.
His horse riding work is unpaid work that he does in his spare time.
Lífeyrissjøds and long shadows.
In 2019, there were many anniversaries in the history of the life savings societies in Iceland.
Embættismenn had been granted pensions from the Danish king all years of the 19th century, but in 1919 a life-etime pension fund for embassy staff was established, which eventually became a life time pension fund for all public servants.
The foundation of the current national labour unions was laid in 1969 with the signing of a general wage agreement on the labour market, which stipulated the establishment of affiliated labour unions with mandatory membership and full--fledged wage unions from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were established on the basis of these agreements, and the welfare system continued to grow after that.
It was not the only radical change that the labour movement of the 20th century achieved through its struggle for wages.
In the famous strikes of 1955, the unemployed had been granted in a similar manner, and the union also gradually gained recognition of demands for sick pay and sickness funds, shorter working hours, improvements in housing conditions and other similar matters.
All of these rights came at a great cost and were the result of hard--fought battles, but turned out to be greater and more permanent than the increase in wages in the wage scale, which disappeared as soon as the war ended and lasted until the 1990s..
The prelude to the establishment of the general welfare organizations in 1969 was both long and complex.
In the end, men came together to agree that the funds were in fact the property of the union members, but the labour movement was forced to accept that the board would be made up of representatives of both employers and union members.
In the following years after the establishment of the unions, the demand for a majority of workers in the management of the unions was often the subject of debate in the labour associations,, but it never reached a majority., and so the situation where representatives of union members are not in a majority in the management of the unions still prevails..
In the 36th paragraph of the law number 129 from 1997 on the obligation to secure the right to receive welfare and the activities of the welfare associations, it is stated that the welfare associations have an investment policy.
In the 1st verse of the 1st verse, it says that "the welfare organization has the welfare of the welfare organization as a priority. "
This is also stated in the 5th line of the 5th verse: " The Labourers' Settlement Fund sets its own ethical standards in its investments. "
In the shareholding agreement of the Lifesaving Society,, among other things, the following provisions are included, in the wake of the previous provisions.
Lifeyrissjøid is a member of the United Nations ( UN PRI ) regulations on responsible investments, along with many of the largest life-ysrissjøids and financial investors in the west and in Europe.
In the regulations, it is stated that the emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good governance in the management of companies, can contribute to improved profitability of shareholding companies.
In this way, the interests of the shareholders and the goals of the nation are combined in a wider context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those that are listed on the stock market, set out a public agenda on governance, working conditions and environmental issues.
The Gild is one of Norway's largest pension funds, has set a " policy on responsible investments " and there are similar provisions.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest fashion of the Norwegian language, " shadow governance " .
Þar as the word is new in the language, it is not clear that it has been fully defined, but it seems that the following definition is " the most common " : shadow leadership is when a leader in a trade union says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the union to take a position in a particular matter.
If they do not follow the instructions, they will be dismissed from the government at the first opportunity.
Ef the foremost man does not use this in the media and does not talk about resignation,, it is not " shadow governance " after all, this is the way of communication between people in the financial world.
It is the author's intention to make the reader think about which " shadowy " path he chooses.
It is mainly two men who have tried to shape this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of 25 July 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at the newspaper Fréttablade, and Asgeir Jonsson, Director of the State Bank.
The reason for both was after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair announced his intention to terminate the contracts of the airline's flight attendants and flight attendants ( to fire them ), and Ragnar Þór Ingolfsson, chairman of the Verslunarmannafelag of Reykjavik sent out the suggestion to the representatives of the union in the board of the Lifeyrissjøk of Reykjavik to not support the possibility of the union buying shares in the company, otherwise they would be fired.
Nokkru later, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and in the wake of this, Ragnar Þør followed suit with his criticism of Boga's decision.
They saw that Hörður and Ásgeir did not see any reason to talk about the matter in the Friday edition of the newspaper Fréttablaðen with large words about shadow government, lawbreaking and the need for changes to the law.
There was a little spider that rolled a heavy load, though the blessed spider was in a dangerous position and was drying up quickly.
Þar as the matter is of great importance, they should focus on the substance itself at the end.
He examined the parts of the law governing life-etime pension funds that apply to this case.
In these, it is stated that the board of trustees have to take care of the interests of the beneficiaries and have moral standards in their investments, and these are further specified in the agreements of the Gild and the Lifeyrissjøds..
Lífeyrissjóðs are not obliged to focus solely on short--term profit in their investments.
This is exactly a dangerous course and it is not difficult to find examples of this in the past,, where large sums of money from banks and funds were given to reckless adventurers and environmental disasters with catastrophic consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was clearly on thin ice when he decided to dismiss a whole group of employees and thus significantly weakened the company's position on the Icelandic market and weakened its position with investors.
As it turned out, he saw it and pulled it back.
The newspaper TIME reveals that it is possible that the investments of the labour union's funds in the company can be considered a threat to the union's members.

I was one of the survivors who did not have a homecoming ceremony.
The one of the three who was diagnosed with the disease in the country on the 15th of July last year, came to the country from the Baltic countries for about one and a half weeks before.
He is an Icelander who is not permanently resident in the country and did not receive clear instructions about the use of the home country's immigration policy after arriving in the country and traveling to another country a few days after arriving in the country.
He was rejected by the border guards.
" He is in the Norwegian society and in reality he is supposed to be in the quarantine area, " says Kamilla Josepsdottir, a specialist in the surveillance area at the Ministry of Health, in a conversation with the newspaper Fréttablade in the day.
" He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the kennel numbers and if the kennel numbers are not registered, they are not called for the second round. "
Hún says that the man used the English registration form because he is in fact resident abroad, but because of his ties to Norway he should have used the Norwegian form.
He has, however, not understood it.
"When the kennitalan is not registered, he has to seek it himself in the second examination..
Hvorki he and his employer seem to have realized that this was the right way. " says Kamilla.
"This means that it is clear that they have to increase the information about this while they try to find a way to make a self--ordination system even though the Icelanders do not register their birth certificates..
Eð or það is to make it more apparent who is a participant in the Icelandic society in the registration system..
In the end,, however, he was able to overcome the obstacles that he faced when he first arrived in the country,, despite the fact that he is considered to be a participant in the Icelandic society,, even though he is an Icelander..
Only six were sent into quarantine after he was diagnosed the day before, and these six were all in a relationship with him.
They are still to be tested, but two of them are already showing symptoms of the disease.
The man received negative results from his test at the border on the 15th of July.
Kamilla says that it is likely that he had been recently infected with the virus, that he had not been able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not rule out the possibility that the man was infected in Iceland, but did not carry the infection to the country.
"It is not possible to say that it is an imported infection because it has been a long time since he came to the country and he could have been exposed to it in the same way as the two who caused a small outbreak in connection with athletic competitions. "
It says, however, that it is very unlikely due to the small number of men in the area.
"It is, in fact, very unlikely, " says Kamilla, but it is not possible to rule it out until the Institute of Genetics has sequenced the virus in the man.
"If a new strain of the virus is introduced, it is almost certain that it was brought to the country. "

Solskjær says that this is not the match that defines the season.
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the match against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game and Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, at the end of the season, Solskjær and his men end up in 5th place and miss out on the Champions League.
They will have hope of making it to the Champions League by winning the Europa League in the next month.
"They are not at the end of the road.
Ef að they win against Leicester, people say that they have not had a bad season. " said Solskjær.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of their journey, as they still have a lot of ground to make up on the two teams above them. " said Solskjær.
It is clear that the tendons of men are twisted at 15 o' clock in the day,, but Solskjær tried to make it as if it was a normal match.
"If a man wants to be part of Manchester United, he has to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is not new,, and it is on this basis that the club is founded.
I have set up the team for a good end to the season and now it's up to the players to take advantage of it.
"This is not the most important game of the season, it is only the next game.
He can talk to anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define the season of the team, they have already had many moments that define this season.

65,000 infections per day.
65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were recorded in the United States in the previous day according to the Johns Hopkins University.

I are afraid of the second wave of the epidemic.
The Spanish government is now trying to prevent the spread of the disease in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of the disease on Thursday and Friday.
Þar have been more than 1,000 new cases in a single day since the beginning of May and the news comes at the same time as Spain begins to lift the strictest outgoing ban in Europe.
This led to the fact that the British authorities forced the passengers who came from Spain to go into quarantine upon their return to the United Kingdom.
The island of Iceland was previously on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the north--east of Spain, where the authorities have taken widespread measures to try to stop the growth.
In the capital of Barselóna, the entertainment venues are closed for the next two weeks and nightclubs are forced to close at midnight.
This ban is now in effect for 200,000 inhabitants of Segria County in the western part of Catalonia..
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the aftermath of the plague.
Tui, the largest airline in Britain, cancelled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands on the day.
The governments of many countries are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but little enthusiasm has been shown to reinstate the widespread outbreak ban.
In addition, Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken a very negative view of such and similar weapons that he does not want to use.
Þá he has said that the nation " would not survive economically or socially " if the ban was reintroduced.
A number of ministers believe that the localized outbreaks that reach the inhabitants of individual villages, cities or regions are sufficient to prevent the spread of the virus in the next round.
Five new infections in Iceland - three within the country.
There were three domestic transmissions and two additional transmissions at the border in the past day.
In Norway, five individuals were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infection in the past day.
In the announcement from the Ministry of Defense, it is stated that one of the infections is related to the infection detected in the Rey Cup football tournament the day before.
He has been sent to solitary confinement and 16 who were in close proximity to him in isolation.
He was a participant in the activities of the athletic club in Reykjavik and was, according to the announcement, " only a part of the athletic team " in quarantine.
Others who were sent to solitary confinement are related to the man in other ways.
The origin of the infection is unknown and the search for the source of the infection is still ongoing by the police.
The organizers of the Rey Cup tournament have followed the guidelines and regulations of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Defense, and have made the necessary arrangements.
However, the pictures of the match from the previous day attracted attention as they showed the players in close proximity celebrating their good performance on the pitch.
In the morning of 11th day of the month, the organizers released a statement on their Facebook page.
There stands " Ath " and " Parents are urged to respect the rules that the competitors must bring their own equipment to the school.
Parents are not allowed to do it.
I have been able to show a good understanding of the language..
The second infection was detected in the previous day and is related to the infection detected in the previous day..

Work is being carried out on tracing the source of the infection, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 people are in quarantine due to the source of the infection.
The third case is from a man who came to the island 11 days ago, on 15 July.
He died in the southwest of the country.
He is now in isolation and six were in close proximity to him in confinement.
Two of them are already showing symptoms of viral infection.
In addition, two were detected at the border and are awaiting the outcome of further surveys, as the surveys for smuggling at the border stipulate..
At the end of the announcement, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Health and Welfare urged people to be careful and to take good care of themselves.
There is no certainty that the symptoms of the Covid 19 virus are present, but the same person is asked to take a sample at the next health station..
The town of Patreksfjordur says that the camping site is overbooked during the holiday period. The number of visitors has doubled.
The camp in Patreksfjord is fully booked during the weekend, according to a statement from Vesturbyggd.
The audience was told to look at other accommodation options.
Nefnir Vesturbyggd Bíldudal, Tálknafjord, Melanes on Rauðsand and Fløkalund and Breiðavik as other alternatives in the station.
There is a lot of activity in Patreksfjord during the weekend,, because as in previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Norwegian documentary films is held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
The number of visitors to the tents is expected to increase this year because of good weather, but DV reported earlier in the day that the weather forecast was bad.
However, the worst weather is expected in the south, and hope for Patreksfjord.
Vefurinn bb.s said first, and said that all other accommodation in the city were already full.
Heilt fjölbýlishus fell down on the best place in the city.
Romanian workers live freely on Dunhaga 18 – 20.
In the meantime, the owners are seeking building permits for renovations, but their requests have been delayed by the bureaucracy in the third year.
In one of the oldest, most ancient and most expensive neighborhoods of the city of Reykjavik, stands a multi--story housing complex.
In the basement of the house, there are about 600 square meters of warehouse space.
In front of the house, there are two staircases, each of which contains four fairly large apartments..
They are between 93 and 130 square meters,, although most are over 100.
The house has a significant history.
It was built in 1959 and has also housed a video rental, the Mjolkursamsolen's milk factory, the Jøa cannon foundry, a fishing company and most recently the University Press.
The house has been so beautifully decorated that it is hard to believe.
The house is now badly damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 are, according to the company register, Magnus Magnusson and Guðrún Helga Lárusdottir.
Magnus was a member of the board of Borgun and was the chairman of the ownership company Borgun.
In the group of owners of the Borgun company, is Stalskip.
Stalskip AS is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdottir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third of D18.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, ran the shipping company Stálskip.
The house was bought in the summer of 2009 and has been neglected since then.
The neighbors say that the condition of the house has deteriorated continuously since the 1990s, though most of the deterioration occurred in the 2000s.
The house has not been " particularly lively " in the last few years.
It can be played in that the owners have been trying to change the house and the land for a number of years.
The other neighbors say that the house has not been in good condition for a long time.
"It is long overdue to do something about this spot and it is a shame that it has dragged on for so long. "
Segir hann jafnfrately that he is fed up with the owners of the house for not forcing him to finish the project and find a common ground with his neighbors..
"To do this, in coordination with the community in the surrounding area, so that it is possible to drive the project and complete it. "
"Lögfræedistappi " that the inhabitant refers to is the planning process of the site, which has been going on since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 applied for permission to build a new building on top of the existing housing complex and behind the house, a new elevated house and an annex on one floor. .
The building permit granted for the project was overturned by the Supreme Court on the grounds that the construction was not in accordance with the district plan and that the preliminary survey was inadequate.
The municipality of Reykjavik started work on the district plan and finished it with an announcement in the Stjørnartidend in July of the previous year.
The same arrangement was also condemned and abolished by the board in March 2020.
At this time, three years had passed since the original application for building permission and the owners of the house at the beginning of the site.
The house had fallen into disrepair and the neighbours were tired of it.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and their reactions, they responded in various ways.
Some understood the intentions of the house owners, others did not..
Others aimed at the city, others did not.
The others were angry but not out for revenge.
Other said that the parking areas were crowded, that neighbors have used the unused parking areas of Dunhaga 18 – 20 for their own vehicles.
He said that he was tired of the government.
"If they have to go through the process three times, it is unbelievable.
It is as if the city of Reykjavik could not read.
In the day, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
The ministry of the city's governance and the grand plans of the owner and many years of their work are at the beginning of the road.
When a reporter came to the garden at Dunhaga 18, the doors burst open and mounds of rubble appeared.
The Playstation computer and the new television lay among other rubbish on the ground - they were the sacrificial victims of the Norwegian summer bonfire.
It was opened in the old printing room of the University, and there were a lot of cats with the smell of the land.
It is clear that someone has been hiding in one of the corners,, but no one can be seen.
Stacks of sofas and mattresses, and a number of geological maps were strewn across the floor.
The rooms of the house were also open and life was in both of them.
The reporter was so lucky to meet two of them.
There were Romanians cooking their potato soup in the evening meal and they invited a journalist to join them.
The Romanians are working for the staffing agency Strongforce Ltd.
They have been there for a long time and according to DV, the company has not paid for the house, only heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not feasible to collect rent.
It is clear from the positions of posters in the entrance of the house that there have been a large number of foreign workers in the house in the last few years.
The operation of the workmen's leagues has not been affected by the Covid-19 situation, since the decline in tourism has led to a decline in the construction industry and these two branches have been the most active in using the workmen's leagues.
In contrast, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty of work to do and they stayed in the workshops and warehouses for the night after a long working day in the rain.
In spite of the poor condition of the house, the boy's room, which the boys shared, appeared to have been well maintained.
When the newspaper reporter met the Romanian boys, he suddenly became cold--hearted. In the best place in Reykjavik, there is a 1,500 square metre property that is severely damaged.
The owners want to change the house to improve it, and the neighbors disagree on the definition of " improvement.
In the middle is the city's planning area at the beginning of the planning process, the endless number of appeals and judgement possibilities in the planning process and the flights out of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court for Environment and Natural Resources.
In the house, live Romanian workers, possibly those who are working to improve the situation when the Norwegians leave..
The article originally appeared in the Sunday edition of DV on 17 July.
In the aftermath of the coronavirus epidemic, a campaign against overweight was launched.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson will give 10 million pounds to the campaign against obesity, which includes a ban on fast food advertisements after he suffered a serious illness partly due to his weight.
In the meantime, Johnson was scheduled to launch his campaign, on Monday,, with the campaign being called the " Better Health " campaign, and with the campaign calling for doctors to encourage the use of wheelchairs for patients in overweight and with the campaign also calling for an attack on the increase of wheelchair paths.
It is reported that the broadcasting of advertisements for fast food restaurants in television is banned after 21:00 in the evening according to British media sources.
" Coronavirus has awakened them to the danger of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined to use the time to become healthier, more active and eat a healthy diet. "
Johnson was admitted to hospital in the spring of 2012 after being diagnosed with coronavirus, and it is partly due to his weight that he is said to have suffered so severely.
Women are better suited to lead the changes.
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation could take in the direction of greater decentralization, transparency and in the fight against corruption and the interests of the whole nation.
"It is necessary to change gear somewhat now and that group of society that is better suited to lead these changes is the one that is more inclined to be in these moods..
Það was women, " said Helga.
" Women in Iceland are famous for their women's movement.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
In this way, it is now up to them to lead these changes.
She said that she was somewhat uneasy about the emphasis on Iceland as " the best in the world " in terms of gender equality and human rights.
"This means that they are not ready to examine what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and look back on all that has happened.
Það is a lot.
They have to know where they are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listening to the voices of marginalized groups.
I don't live in the same rules as all here, said Helga.
When asked, she said that women are in many ways in good shape in Iceland, but added that, like in many other places, the Icelanders live in a very masculine society.
She said that politics revolved around the pursuit of power, dominance and authority, which were the forces that perpetuated misrule in all societies.
"The women have now formed a group and come together and they are frustrated that Alþingi is trekking in trekk to ignore the 2012 vote. "
"It is these feminine qualities that they are thinking about.
From the point of view of human rights and nature protection,, cooperation and the fact that they are all sitting at the same table, she said and added that these were the fundamental principles of the new constitution.
"It is a very rich country in terms of natural resources and it is unfathomable that there are people living in poverty.
Það is far-fetched, it is possible to split in a different way, said Helga.
"It is far-fetched that there is a natural law that women's jobs are always paid less.
It is unfathomable that flight attendants and nurses have to fight endlessly for wages that are equal to those of men.
It is possible to sign under the new constitution of Norway on the island of Iceland through electronic means.

Tugir in quarantine and some of them have started to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Fimm have been diagnosed with the corona virus in the last three days and are most of them infected.
They are in quarantine because of this, and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people were diagnosed with the coronavirus in the past day and two at the border checkpoint.
A specialist at the Ministry of Health says that the increasing number of domestic transmissions does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in society.
"It has been analysed from the first domestic infection and it is a virus that has not been seen in Norway before, so there is no reason to believe that it has been present in society for a long time.
This is probably something that has been introduced to the country recently, but they have to be on high alert now. " said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdotter, a specialist on the surveillance department of the Embassy of the Landlord.
The majority of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
More samples are to be taken in the coming months, but some of those who were in contact with the infected have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now, there is no influenza epidemic and there are fewer cases of other airborne diseases, so they are able to be a little more liberal with the tests on individuals who were found to have been infected during the influenza epidemic. " said Kamilla.
It is mostly finished but it is not out of the question that more people have to go into quarantine..
Two of the infected were identified after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions about whether it is appropriate to hold such events.
The head of the Norwegian Civil Defence Agency says that it is possible for as long as people follow the guidelines and regulations.
Kamilla says that it is almost impossible that the infected were infected at sporting events.
"If the number of people in isolation is not increased from these individuals after having been in contact with them at the athletic competitions, it can be claimed that the isolation measures at the competitions have been effective.
En það is not known, " said Kamilla.
The Ministry of Defence is in a constant state of re-assessment.
"We have to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it appears necessary. " said Kamilla.
After a few weeks, the number of people to be restricted is to be increased to 1,000.
This new position may have had an impact on the relaxation of the rules.

Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle.
The municipal authorities in Seattle in the state of Washington have declared a state of rebellion in the aftermath of the large--scale protests in the city centre.
The police used firecrackers and pepper spray to try to clear a large area that protesters had taken over and stretched over several houses in the neighborhood of the parliament building.
The police announced on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into damage caused to a police station in the city on the previous day,, possibly by a bomb.
Police and law enforcement authorities say that protesters threw stones, bottles, explosives and other loose objects at the police and one police officer was transported to a hospital where he was treated for injuries.
The protests in Seattle were, however, peaceful for a long time.
They were sent to Portland, Oregon, to show that there was unity between the protesters there, where there had been repeated clashes between protesters and armed units of the state police.
There,, like in many cities in the United States, people gather together under the banner of Black Lives Matter and commemorate the death of George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on 25 May, and protest against the institutional racism in the American society.
It is not to be recalled until after the vote.
It is not yet clear whether the dismissals of the Icelandair flight attendants, which are to take effect in the next month, will be revoked.
The rafræn vote of the Icelandair flight attendants's union for the Icelandair flight attendants ends at midday on the following day.
The chairman of the company, Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, says that Icelandair will not make a decision about the dismissals until the voting results are known.
"It is clear that the two are connected " says Guðlaug Líney.
" There have been no dismissals recalled, this would have to be laid down in such a way that it would be possible to man the aircraft.
As a result, people are desperate to find out whether they will have a job after the end of the month.
It is about a contract that was signed the day before the 19th of July, in the early hours of the 20th of July.
It is planned that it will last until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract that flight attendants had previously voted on.
On 17 July, the board and the trustees of the Icelandic Airline Association voted to call a general strike at Icelandair, and the members of the association voted for it in a vote.
Til her came never,, but this was decided in the wake of a decision by Icelandair to terminate negotiations with the Flight Attendants Association and to dismiss all its flight attendants and seek an agreement with another trade union.
The airmen of the company were to take on the role of security personnel on board on a temporary basis.
She says that it is difficult to predict the outcome of the vote.
" People are still suffering from this attack by Icelandair, when all the airline's flight attendants were dismissed and told that they would be employed by another trade union.
It is now revealed that it has an effect, " she says.
940 flight attendants worked at Icelandair at the end of April, when 900 of them were laid off, 95 percent of them..
Uppsagnarfrestur for those with the shortest working life is three months and it ends at the end of the month of July and August.
In the group there are 90% of the flight attendants of Icelandair.
What will happen if the agreement is not accepted.
"They want to continue negotiations with their partners.
With this agreement, Icelandair is meeting the demands of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that flight attendants have gone too far.
The vote on the new collective agreement ended and Icelandair announces the results of the first quarter of the year on the following day.
The vote on the new collective agreement ends at 12 o'clock in the morning.
Uppgjör Icelandair for the second quarter will also be published on the morning, but the emergency revenue of the company has fallen by 85 percent compared to the same period in the previous year.
The rafræn vote on the contract between the Icelandic Airline Association and the Icelandic Flight Attendants Association began on Wednesday, 22 July and ended on Monday, 27 July at 12 o'clock in the morning.
Those who can vote on the agreement are employees of Icelandair who pay membership fees to the Flight Attendants' Association.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective agreement on the night of 19 July, after the airline terminated negotiations with the union in early July after flight attendants rejected a previous agreement in a vote.
Icelandair had dismissed all of its flight attendants and flight crew on Friday, but they were reinstated after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to the new contract, flight attendants have to fly five times more per month for the same salary.
The Kjarasamning agreement is valid until 2025, but there is an agreement between flight attendants and flight attendants about how long they can fly on one shift.
The agreement was introduced to the members of FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel the previous Monday and many of the flight attendants interviewed by the news agency were dissatisfied with the agreement.

A new variant of the virus rather than a new species of the virus.
"The new strain means that it was a person who came from abroad.
Þese reports of a new strain of the virus have been circulating in Norway.
Three domestic transmissions were detected and two at the border.
A person who had been infected had participated in a football tournament called the Rey Cup,, but the origin of the infection was not known and the spread of the infection was being tracked.
The disease was also found in a person who came to the country on 15 July, and two people who were in contact with him began to show symptoms of the disease.
In the previous day, a smite was discovered that was related to a smite that was discovered the previous day, and after a genetic analysis at the Norwegian Institute of Genetics, a new type of virus was discovered that had not been found in Norway before.
The transmission of the infection is completed in connection with the infection.
He says that it is not a new virus, that it is the same virus that has spread all over the world,, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS- CoV 2.
It is more accurate to talk about a new variant of the virus rather than a new species of the virus.
It is not clear what this means and it is not clear whether it is the beginning of a new wave of the disease. Mår says that it is as if it is a single incident and that it is not clear whether there will be more of it.
"However, if there are cases in the country that are not from abroad and are of the same genotype as this particular strain, it is possible to draw the conclusion that this is the second wave, but it is premature at this stage. " explains Már.
Hamingjan in the hot pot.
The secret of the happiness of the Icelanders is hidden in the hot baths.
The BBC's daytime programme makers produced a short film that highlighted the popularity of swimming pools and saunas in the country.
Iceland's bathing culture is unique in the world and it is claimed that there are more bathing places per inhabitant than anywhere else in the world.
The natural heat of the earth is the basis of it,, but also the tradition of using it.
In 1940, compulsory Sunday schooling for children was introduced, older citizens are also keen to use the hot water for their health.
Ferries are described as a fixed part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, they are all equal, regardless of class and status.

It is a long way to get 100 days in the elections.
100 days are until the Americans go to the election and choose their president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re--election, but he is on the back foot.
Biden is ahead of Trump in the polls on a statewide basis, according to polling surveys.
According to a new survey by the Associated Press news agency, a large number of Americans believe that the country is heading in the wrong direction.
The response of Trump to the new coronavirus epidemic is also very unpopular and, in addition, more Americans than before believe that the president has mismanaged the economy.
Nine out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right path.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the outbreak and 48 percent say he has handled the economy well.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average of Five Thirty Eight, Biden has 49.9 percent of the vote nationally and 41.9 percent of the vote for Trump.
In this way, Trump himself has tried to divert attention from his poor performance in the face of the crisis to the so--called cultural conflicts and to promote policies that are supposed to be based on laws and regulations.
Framboð Biden puts a lot of effort to keep the focus on Trump and believes that he has a great chance of winning if the election is actually about whether he has done a good job in the last four years.
The popularity of Trump also seems to be affecting the members of the Republican Party, and it is possible that the Democrats could gain a majority in the House of Representatives..
Politico said on the days that the party's and the candidate 's popularity was similar to that in the 1970s and that the Republican Party would suffer its worst decline in a century.
In the parliamentary elections of 2016, Uthverfi proved to be the worst constituency for the party,, and it is likely that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to frighten the inhabitants of the suburbs to follow him,, among other things, by saying that if Biden becomes president, he would destroy the suburbs of the United States and stir up racial conflicts.
Among other things, Trump has abolished a decree from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
Then he urged " housewives " in the outlying areas of the United States to read an article written by the former Secretary of State of New York, where she claimed that Biden would destroy the outlying areas of the United States and took Trump under it.
" Biden will destroy their neighborhoods and the American dream.
The President said that he would preserve it, and even make it better. "
The population of the outlying areas of the United States is constantly growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
From 2004, when George W. Bush was re--elected,, the candidate with the most votes from this group has become president.
In 2012, Mitt Romney received more votes from this group than Barack Obama but lost to him.
In 2016, Trump secured a narrow majority in the outlying areas, but his popularity there has fallen dramatically.
Tho there is a difference between the cannons, Biden has a 15 percent advantage over Trump in the number of votes.

The Olympic Games are the light at the end of the runway.
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, a sporting event that has only been affected by world wars,, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Games would be " the light at the end of the journey " and referred to the worldwide epidemic of the coronavirus that the world is going through in unity.
The athletes have an extra year to prepare and the Japanese authorities have increased the cost of the postponement.
All of them hold the house, though it is in ruins.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympic Games in 2008, the celebrations of the Japanese delegation were disrupted.
They shouted and shouted back and forth until they decided to hold the games in Tokyo in 2016, but the decision was made in favor of Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were in the limelight of the world.
The matches were scheduled to be played from 24 July to 9 August but were postponed for a year and started on 23 July 2011 and ended on 8 August 2011.
If it is not possible to hold the games, if the coronavirus is still a threat, the games are cancelled.
No one wants to think it through to the end.
The Olympic Games are not the usual kind of athletic competition..
The show is always a spectacle and is trying to top the previous one.
The choice of the host city for the Olympic Games is based on the assessment of the selection committee on the presentation of the cities.
The more spectacular the presentation is, the greater the likelihood of success.
Oslo was awarded 150 million Norwegian krones in an attempt to host the 2016 Olympic Games.
In the second time,, when they applied for the 2020 Olympics, they spent 75 million dollars, 10 million Norwegian krones on the preparations.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the Games in 2012,, the Japanese government allocated approximately 30 million krone to the project.
En the budget for this is only a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of building the Olympic village, the venues and preparing the country to host the Games, as well as holding the Games themselves.
The organizers in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which had been scheduled to take place that year but had been postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 126 million dollars.
In the report from the state inspector in Japan, which was published at the end of the year,, however, it was stated that the cost was nearly double the official figure.
Likely it would not be possible to determine the cost of postponing the matches, but it was estimated that it would cost between two and six million dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could be as high as 15 to 30 million dollars.
There are so high numbers that all of the revenue from the Norwegian government's contribution to the Olympic Games is only enough for about half of the total cost of the Games..
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of scrutiny by economists, who have examined the impact of the games on the economy.
In short, it seems that many have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games on the economies of the cities that host them is less positive than negative.
The short- term effects are some,, for example, the number of jobs has increased significantly in the short term, but in the longer term, cities often have a surplus of unused buildings and high operating costs.
The city of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, has large debts due to the 2016 Games and has struggled to maintain all of the large athletic facilities built for the Games.
The number of people who received employment related to the Olympic Games in the city were only 10 percent of those who were unemployed before.
It means that no new jobs were created, only to a small extent.
In general, cities have not come out well financially from hosting the Olympics due to the high cost of building facilities for the games.
However, it is often said that there is an increase in the number of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities in the wake of the games,, but there is a lot of uncertainty about the 2021 games.
It is also unclear whether it is possible to accommodate all of the large number of spectators who normally attend the games.
The main thing, however, is the honor of being chosen,, but it is difficult to assess it in terms of money.
In spite of the enormous cost, it is also possible to say that the joy that the actors bring is not of the same kind as that which can be placed on a scale.
The show is often spectacular and there is no shortage of money. However, it is not just about money..
It is the athletes who are in the foreground.
For some of the athletes, the postponement of the games is just a blessing.
The Australian pentathlon athlete and gold medalist in her event at the 2008 Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, single and has not been in good form during the summer but hopes to be in competitive form for the 2012 Olympics.
She is one of the athletes who is more content with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after the Games, the postponement of the Games in some cases meant that they were forced to retire earlier than they had planned.
He is not able to trust his body to go through another year of strenuous training..
Few athletes captured the hearts of the audience at the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 as much as the gymnast Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has met in several interviews in her home country of the United States to discuss the Olympic Games.
She intends to participate in the 2021 Olympics, but she is not sure that she will be on top again at the 2012 Olympics, because she is now 24 years old.
Although she is not considered to have a high age, she is in a higher rank than a female athlete in the first line.
"This is a sensitive issue, " says Biles, but smiles in a second interview with the Olympic Committee's website.
" She does not know whether she will be on top again after a year of training. "
She has previously said that her body is not able to handle the stress of competitive gymnastics for a long time.
She is still competing for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles has admitted that it was a difficult feeling to have to stop training suddenly when the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games were at their peak and the Olympic swimming pool was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles as compared to other athletes while all of the athletic facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold medals could not be sold, she had to find various ways to keep herself in shape like other athletes.
The basic form is, in fact, slightly better than with most people.
"They have a strict schedule now..
It was difficult to start training again after the gymnastics hall was opened again.
I started slowly but is coming on full throttle in the new season and he intends to increase the intensity of his training as the year progresses.
I know that they do not know exactly how these actors will be or whether they will be held, but they rehearse based on the assumption that they would be,, but they can't do anything else.
I have put too much pressure on herself to leave the sport. "
With her and others, there is a sense of doubt or uncertainty that the matches might not be held in 2021 rather than 2022.
It is impossible to predict what will happen.
In July 2021, the situation of the world's epidemic of the coronavirus is unclear, and there is no other way than to prepare for the Olympic Games based on the assumption that they would be held in 2012.
It may be that the Olympic Games is the light at the end of the Covid gang..
The wedding was postponed due to the plague.
The Modern Family actor Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams in the summer.
"There are other more important things to think about at the moment,, " the actress said in an interview with People.
"They want to get married to each other at some point and have the dream wedding and have all the guests who are dear to them.
I decided to postpone it and focus on what is important at the moment and that is to help spread information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
He is more interested in world affairs than marriage at the moment.
There is a lot going on and attention should be focused on what is happening in the world.
