The marketing campaign "Looks Like You Need Iceland " has gone well off the ground and the shouting and shouting from the wild and wide out in the world has begun.
"Thousands of miles away, in the vast world,, a woman says in an advertisement for the marketing campaign " Looks Like You Need Iceland " on the YouTube channel that she needs Iceland.
A second viewer says that he would keep Iceland in his heart forever and a young woman says that she would go to Iceland first because her husband is living there..
She is now in the United States and plans to stay there for a few months..
One of the spectators asks whether the roads to Iceland are open, because there are no planes.
It is not known whether he comes from another time belt.
Egill Þordarson, from the advertising company Peel, together with the international advertising company M and C Saatchi, made the advertisements, said that the response to the advertisements had exceeded expectations.
"He has been involved in many of the Iceland campaigns that have been very successful,, but the new campaign is already breaking records.
In essence, it's about creating publicity for the campaign, that is achieved by getting foreign media to cover it, and that has gone very well.
In a relatively short time, they have received coverage in more than 700 newspapers and magazines around the world, reaching more than 2 million people.
The value of the coverage is estimated at 180 million Norwegian krones.
Það is not amalegt.
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has gone well there, despite the fact that the United States is not the first country to visit Norway.
According to Egil, known markets such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also taken well to it, as well as Russia, which came as a pleasant surprise.
This has led to a response from distant regions,, such as India,, which was not specifically mentioned.
" These advertisements have been viewed by more people than they expected, " says Egill, but it is known that more than four million people have watched the advertisements on YouTube.
" They had not been able to ask for a better start. "
These pictures were taken by photographer Arni Sæberg during the filming of advertisements with the slogan " Let It Out " in mid- the last month.
The caves were found all over the country, in Reykjavik on the Skovorodden, in Rynefjør near Skøgfoss, on Solaheim Glacier and in a cave near Hjørleifshöfda.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Pall Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cameraman was Óttar Guðnason.
In the roles of these characters, were the Irish actress Anna Jia and the Hungarian actor Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
The Icelanders came to make the advertisements, at the same time as filming took place in Southern Norway, another group was filming in Western Norway and the Westfjords.
According to Egils, " Let It Out " is only the first part of the " Looks Like You Need Iceland " campaign, which is planned to be followed by a winter campaign in collaboration with M and C Saatchi.
"This is only the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Film Commission,, says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M and C Saatchi has gone very well.
"It's fantastic to work with them.
In such cases, it is crucial to have a foreign partner with knowledge of the markets they are talking about.

Just the fact of being with the children in the garden is something that is never forgotten..

I bought a boat after the 10th grade.
"There are not many sailors who work in the kindergartens of the country " says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who works as a fisherman during the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.
Coastal fishing is a very pleasant summer job when one is in school.
If the fishing is good, it is possible to have good income and it is good to be free from the obligation to take a scholarship.
Tekjurnar duga him well in the winter as well, " says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, 25-year old psychology student, who is doing fishing in the summer as he has done in the previous summers.
Axel arrived at the harbour in Tålknafjør late in the evening on the first day of the week when a newspaper reporter spoke to him.
"The year he was in tenth grade, he took the captain's license for boats under 12 meters and bought his own boat the summer after graduating from high school.
He has been fishing from his boat all summer..
He bought the boat from a friend, named Hartmann Jonsen, and he named the boat after him.
Hartmann was already an adult when he bought the boat and had stopped sailing, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after Axel took over the ship, and he bought the ship for 3 million Norwegian krones.
"He made a contract with Hartmann to pay half of the money, one and a half million in the beginning of the summer and the other half in the end of the summer when he had finished fishing.
He owned the boat free of debt at the end of his first summer on it.
In other words, a boy with one and a half million to pay out on a boat when he had just finished high school.
" He had been working with his father on the sea when he was a boy, he had been working with his father on the sea all summer and received his share.
He also put his confirmation money in the boat's chest.
Axel was born in Ísafjörð, where all his mother's family is from, but he has lived in Kópavog since he was a child.
"He can fish in the west of the country because he has a residence permit with his grandmother in Ísafjörð.
He learned the area on the west side of the country with his father from horse- drawn wagons.
He travels between the fjords depending on how he feels, because this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
However, he feels that the best place to fish is to the west, but he has also fished in the vicinity of the island of Snaefell and further afield.
I has also fished in the south, and the most common fish there is the seabird. Axel, who always goes fishing early in the morning, says that he sometimes talks with the seabirds and sings to the sky in the early hours of the day.
"Netsambandið out at sea is good, so he can listen to radio broadcasts and music.
It is not a problem to be alone on a boat.
is = In general, he tries to avoid bad weather, but he has occasionally been hit by bad weather, but he is lucky because he is not seasick.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes.
"In fishing, he is never more than 14 hours at sea in one day,, but he has also been on fishing expeditions in other areas,, for example in the lease quota,, but he has been out at sea for one and a half days at a time. "
The arrangement for coastal fishing is such that he is allowed to catch 770 kilograms per day, which he finds unsatisfactory.
"Other restrictions are that he can not fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and that he can only fish for 12 days in a month during the four months of stranded fishing in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to have 48 days over all of the summer and to be able to choose after their own whim.
In addition to the coastal fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds, the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds, the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds and the fishing areas that are well situated near the fishing grounds
Axel works through the winter with his university studies at the Nupi school in Kópavog..
"He is proud and adds that he only intended to work temporarily at the leikskol..
"He stayed there because he felt it was an amazing job.
He hopes that the psychology degree will be useful to him on the secondary school course in the future, " says Axel, who is also well advanced with a degree in business economics.

The villa in the list of people who come to the country was created by the fact that a person who was living in the country was not called back for a re-examination.
There is no obligation to write the name of the person on the envelope when it is written in English, as it is when it is written in Icelandic.
"This will be examined in the coming week, " says the specialist in the field of disease prevention at the Ministry of Health.
Three domestic transmissions were detected in the virology department of the Landspitals in the previous day.
The other one who proved to be positive arrived in the country on the 15th of July, two days after the regulations of the so-called homecoming immigrants came into effect.
Those who were living on the island were screened upon their arrival to the country and again four to five days later.
Fram said in the RÚV morning news that he had instead followed the old rules.
He was not called back for screening for the virus.
In a conversation with the newspaper, Kamilla Rut Sigfusdottir, a specialist in the immigration department of the Ministry of Health, said that this could be traced back to a flaw in the registration passport.
Fylli fólk up the registration sheet in English is not a requirement to put in a name like in the Icelandic version.
It was first and foremost intended for foreign tourists.
This is because the person in question had not been invited to take part in the test.
Kamilla says that many have followed the rules about homecomings, even though they have filled the registration forms in English and in some cases, the employers have also been aware of sending people back for a second check.
"This will be examined in the week, how it is possible to make it easier for people to get access to this, to attract attention to it. "
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in solitary confinement.
They all underwent a medical examination, two of them showed signs of the disease.
Smitrakning is in progress with the three smits that were detected on the day before, but it is mostly finished due to the two smits that were detected on the day before.
In both cases, DNA analysis by the Institute of Genetics at the University of Oslo has revealed that there is a new strain of the coronavirus that has not previously been found in Norway.
In the other case, the bonds have been directed to Iceland, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it would be clear on the next day where the infection was coming from.
There are now 15 people in isolation due to the virus. en.
135 are in quarantine.
Fjögur of five infections are unrelated.
Five domestic transmissions have been detected in Norway in the past days.
In the four cases, it is not possible to find the origin of the infections that occurred at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in 2009.
Smitrakning is still ongoing.
The original 30 were sent to solitary confinement, the number was reduced to 16.
In total, 34 are in quarantine due to the new infections that were discovered the day before.
It is the second time in a short time that a case of infection has been detected at an athletic event and has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
He says that it is possible, as long as people follow the rules and guidelines.
"They are constantly urging all those who live in the area to maintain individual sexually transmitted disease prevention..
They also need to emphasize to people who are organizing events that there are certain rules that have to be followed..
Þá it is possible to hold events. " says Johan.
He says that it is possible to prevent the spread of infection by the use of individual preventive measures.
Regulations and guidelines are being reviewed on a regular basis.
"The thing that has to be done, and which the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health are constantly urging people to do,, is to take care of their own individual sexually transmitted infections.
Bæði at home and abroad and at the same time at the service company.
People wash their hands and use sprit.
Það prevents the spread of infection. " he says.
"They need to emphasize to people to continue on the good path they were on, in order to maintain the success they have achieved so far. "
40 % of the victims of the disease were suffering from syphilis 2.
Devon Brumfield heard through the telephone how difficult it was for her father to breathe.
Her father was suffering from syphilis and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was buried.
Andlati was racked by sudden respiratory difficulties due to the coronavirus infection.
Sickness was recorded on the death certificate as the underlying cause and Brumfield, who is also suffering from sykursyke, is afraid that he will die.
The Reuters news agency says that Brumfield's fears are not unreasonable.
The results of a new survey carried out by US authorities showed that nearly 40% of those who died were suffering from syphilis 2, which is the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those under 65 years of age is considered, the proportion rises to half.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) took more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus during the period from February to May.
The results were stunning, especially for those who have syphilis and their partners.
In 12 of the 12 countries, the proportion of the population was similar to the proportion of the population.
10 states, among which are California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet separated from underlying diseases.
"Sickness was when the epidemic was in its early stages.
Now, COVID - 19 has broken through as a powerful storm, " has been reported by Reuters from the head of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago, Elbert Huang.
Sickle cell disease is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who also suffer worse from the coronavirus.
The best defense for those with syphilis 2 is to keep the disease in check with physical exercise, a healthy diet, and the help of health professionals.
The coronavirus epidemic has, however, made it difficult for many to maintain routine.
Then, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue to work in order to avoid being exposed to the virus..
Reuters reports that American authorities were aware of the possibility of the disease being transmitted by the virus.
In 2003, around 20% of those affected by SARS had the disease, and in the swine flu outbreak of 2009, this group was three times more likely to be admitted to hospital.
When MERS became more widespread in 2012, a study showed that 60 percent of those who died or were hospitalized had syphilis.
The effect of the COVID 19 virus could last longer, so that the epidemic has stripped the veil from a number of previously unknown follow--up diseases.
" He fears that there will be a flood of syphilis when this is over, " says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the World Syphilis Association.
Medics have warned that the epidemic could, indirectly, lead to an increase in the incidence of diseases associated with syphilis,, such as kidney disease and kidney failure.
There are new research on the possibility that the coronavirus could lead to an increase in syphilis cases.
The scientists are trying to understand the connection between the coronavirus and syphilis 2.
The virus affects the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weakened in people with syphilis.
It is possible that a high proportion of glucose and lipids in the bodies of those suffering from syphilis can cause a genuine " cellular storm " as it is called when the body's immune system reacts too harshly.
Damaged intracellular membranes can also lead to the formation of bubbles, which in turn can lead to the formation of blood clots.
"It's all one big puzzle, " says Dela Cruz.
"This is connected to all of them. "
Fréttin has been corrected.
"They were offered camp wine, then they left the room. "
The couple, Åsrún Magnusdottir and Atli Bollason were asked by the filmmaker Ragnar Kjartansen to have sex in front of the camera for a film he was making in Paris.
"They loved each other so much that it was not complicated. "
Atli Bollason never forgets when he meets his wife and mother-in law, Aasrune Magnusdottir, for the first time.
" He was very impressed by her.
It was natural that it was the sunlight, but she also thought that she was very attractive.
Og þykir enn, " he says.
Ásrún is aware of this, because her husband's first love is regularly revived.
"I's always hearing this story.
Síðast bara over the weekend, " she said that she fell in love with her husband at first sight.
"Mér fannst and still feels that there is a lot of tension around Atla,, which he likes..
There are a lot of things going on and a lot of things are happening, and he was fascinated by this..
Atli says that the couple have emphasized their own paths in their relationship.
"They do not tie the same knots and travel with the same companions.
In the past, they avoided routines that they perceived in their surroundings.
It is possible that this was the reason for the enthusiastic reception of Ragnar Kjartansen, the filmmaker,, even though it was far from the norm.
"Kirstine Anna's common friend has a relationship with them and asks if they can come to dinner with her, Ragga and Ingibjörge, at Snap. "
They accepted the invitation and met the three kings at Snap and had dessert wine and each of their own after dinner.
They listened to Ragnar as he led them through his plans for an exhibition of his paintings at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
"He had a video work called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it in a simple way.
Ásrún says that he described the incident as a banal and decadent scene from the daily life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he wanted to shoot, and at the end, he told them that he wanted to know whether they were interested in taking part. "
Senan, Ragnar's assistant, said that he wanted to show young middle class couples falling in love in a minimalistic room.
"This is a collaboration with a beginning and an end, " says Atli.
Parið þekkted Ragnar little, though they knew of him and he knew of them " although they knew of him and he knew of them.
They said that they did not want to advertise for people.
They thought that they would not get the right people, but people who were sexually frustrated because they were performing for others.
They sent Ragnar off and agreed that they would discuss the matter, but it took a short time.
"When they walked out of Snap, they said, " We are only there for a short time. "
This was just like that.
I trusted Ragnar as a musician and all of his team. "
"It's about love and closeness. "
Senan was taken up in a fine apartment in the Mýrargotten.
There was a very small film crew, the director Ragnar, the cameraman and the soundman.
After the fire was lit, all of the rooms were evacuated to wait outside in the car, except for Atli and Ásrún.
"They had not decided what they wanted to do.
They received some instructions, but they tried to forget time and place.
To be unaware of what they were doing and for whom.
Það was not played, they only loved each other so it was not complicated. says Åsrún.
En was romantic.
"It was a little romantic, " says Atli and Åsrún agrees.
"They were offered champagne before they left the room..
It was like being on holiday in a luxury hotel in Paris.
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple, which moved them.
"When Tommi looked at it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful. " says Atli.
" It's as much about love and closeness and their own relationships with each other " says Åsrún.
The parents have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice of the son at the National Theatre in Reykjavik and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to think about it " says Atli.
"Mamma and dad saw it in Paris.
I did not tell anyone this,, but he sent a letter to his father and said, " It was fun to meet the little family in the Palace of Tokyo. "
Og it is believed that the participation in the play has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atle.
"They are still together, it may have become more intense.
Þetta deepened his relationship with his extended family, " says Åsrún and laughs.
Sjálf saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleagues.
"It was difficult to be away from him rather than someone else. " she says and turns to her husband.
"It was fun to see it because it is only one scene in a larger work, and when it is seen with the other works, it is very attractive.
I was able to break away from this a little and was proud.
I had a little baby in her stomach at the time,, says Åsrún, who was pregnant with her second child at the time of the incident.
"It was beautiful. "

It can be traced in part to the fact that Robert S. Connan was appointed as ambassador but then resigned.
He had worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for more than a decade.
He resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador in Guatemala.
He then took up a second term as ambassador.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015 and took up his post shortly afterwards, with no ambassador having been stationed in the country for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but was not a diplomat, and had worked as a lawmaker and fundraiser for Barack Obama.
He resigned as ambassador to the United States on 20 January 2017 when Donald Trump took over as president, as is usual with a diplomatic ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusually long in appointing both ambassadors and high--ranking officials in the government in Washington.
It took two years for the United States Congress to appoint Jeffrey Ross Gunter as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the parliament, he said that he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, and that his wife, who died, was of Norwegian descent.
Gunter is politically appointed and was previously a physician in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The owner of the Spilavit company, Sheldon Adelson, founded the organization, but Adelson is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, when there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months.
The reason for this is both the length of time it took for Trump to appoint people to key positions, and the length of time it took to confirm ambassadors.
Since 2009, there has been no ambassador in Norway. for more than five years.
It has, however, not hindered the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which opened new headquarters at Engjateig in 2009.
The construction is estimated to have cost around 65 million Norwegian krones, and the building is surrounded by bulletproof walls and bulletproof glass in all windows.
It seems that the current ambassador does not have enough confidence because he is said to fear for his life and has asked for armed protection.
The former player of ÍBV was subjected to racism in Iceland - " It was a mistake to come to Iceland "
Tonnay Mawejje, a former player of ÍBV, said that he was subjected to racism when he was in Norway and that he regrets coming to Norway.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny, which was published in the Ugandan newspaper Daily Monitor.
He went to the Uganda Police Football Club, which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In an interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Norway, he played with IBV, Val and Throtti in Norway.
"When he came to Iceland, he did not play in the middle as he was used to,.
Fyrirliði of the team was in that position, but he also had a jersey number that he wanted,, and he got both of them. " said Tony but he played on the right side of the field during the season with ÍBV.
Among other things, Tonny talks about racism that he experienced in Norway.
He says this is a problem for many black players when they play in Europe.
"This happened to him once,, but because he did not understand the language, he ignored everything that was said to him..
I later learned of the matter and then asked his friend what the matter was about.
He said that his opponent had made racist remarks about him after he took him down.
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He says that he has made the mistakes that he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to get himself in the starting lineup of Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get a place in the national team.
Þá he asked him to go back to Ireland on loan, he then went to join Val.
"It was a mistake to return to Iceland on loan.
Eg held that if he had been in Norway for longer, he would have received the opportunities he wanted. Tonny said that he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would be able to go further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has made it impossible for him to fulfill his dreams of playing in a big team in Europe.
A worm was found in the neck of a woman.
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 inch long black worm in the throat of the woman.
The fishermen managed to pull the whale out with a pole.
Research led to the conclusion that a parasitic organism was involved.
The news is reported by CNN..
Kona had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the parasite was removed, but tapeworms like this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi became popular in Western countries, the number of cases where parasitic worms have infected people has increased, according to CNN.
The fear is that a second wave is about to start in Europe.
The Spanish are now in the limelight in connection with concerns about another wave of the corona virus in Europe, where the government has taken action to halt the spread of the new outbreak.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but it is more widespread in other cities where the disease is spreading.
The other European countries have also taken action in response to the spread of the infection in Spain, but in Britain all those returning from Spain have to go into quarantine, like in Norway and France, and the French have been warned against travelling to Spain.
Smitum is also on the increase in France and Germany, where the authorities are trying to balance the need to restrict the spread of the virus with the need to restart the economy.
The situation in Europe is, however, good compared to other parts of the world, and the number of new infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 per day, with the highest number of new infections in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide, with 644,000 deaths attributed to the virus.
The mosaic work of Gerðar is finally given its full glory.
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavik there is a large and deep hole.
They are wearing orange helmets..
There is also a large grave.
and more of the smaller work vehicles.
The road is closed for traffic.
The gangstéet is wide and there are many who stand there and admire the million mosaic tiles,, like they have never seen them before..
It is possible that they had never seen it before.
At the least, he did not see it for himself.
It has been hidden up until now, it was in front of it, there were parking spaces that were always occupied.
The people left the car in a hurry and rushed off to their assignments in the city center.
" Lifely and diverse public space " and " an attractive cityscape " are the main goals of the reconstruction of the Tryggvagate.
The goal is to improve the appearance of the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerda Helgadottir at the Toll House to be seen better.
In front of the construction site, a square and the area where the road lies well with the sun is thought to be suitable as a rest area for travellers.
The sculpture is now lit up and has now been given more prominence on the 142- square metre area.
In the area, there are also small " clouds of water ", which offer play and give the area a certain mystical atmosphere.
In this way, the renovations are described by the municipality of Reykjavik as being carried out in conjunction with Veitums.
The water, heat and electricity distribution systems are to be renovated.
In 1925, the school and the cold water pipeline were built, they have therefore served the inhabitants and companies in the middle of the city for nearly a century.
When the road is reopened after the completion of the works, cars can be driven on it again.
She is, however, a busy road, and as a result, more peaceful and accessible spaces for pedestrians are created.
The Toll House was put into use in 1971, and the architect was Gisli Halldorsson.
Due to the harbor flooding reaching through the house, a wall of 250 square meters without windows was formed in front of the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a flat surface would have a negative impact on the overall appearance of the city, unless special arrangements were made to enhance the appearance of the house.
The parties agreed that it would be appropriate to erect a permanent monument there.
At this time, there was a lot of talk about Gerði Helgadottir, artist,, in the compilation.
She had worked extensively in mosaic art in Germany and other countries.
It was only after first contact with her that it was decided whether a competition would be held for the work.
Often discussions had been made about the need to reflect the life of the harbor in the work, and that the harbor had been the life of Reykjavik since it was built.
When the artist was interviewed, she was so impressed by the work that she was trapped by it.
It was agreed that she would be given drawings and other assistance before she left the country,, where she would work on the proposals from abroad.
Gerður received the time she wanted, and when she returned home, she put forward a number of proposals for discussion.
It was agreed without hesitation to ask her to work on the project.
At the same time, she was asked to make a joint agreement with the famous sculpture company in Germany, the Oidtmann brothers,, with whom she had long worked on the reconstruction of famous sculptures in various parts of Europe.
The contract was signed and Gerður won the contract for the construction of the Toll House.
All the work was carried out exceptionally well, by both Gerða Helgadottir and the Oidtmann brothers. it says in the summary.
It has withstood the storms of the Irish weather since then.
It took Gerði two years to complete the work, which was completed in 1972 and 1973.
She died two years after the completion of the tollhouse, at the age of 47.
It is preparing the transfer of more institutions to the countryside.
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs, announced that more public institutions would be relocated to the countryside in the coming years.
This said by the minister in the episode of Sprengisand on Bylgjunni in the afternoon.
The fire prevention department of the Housing and Building Agency was moved to Sauðarøy in autumn..
The fire brigade's specialists work at the institution but none of them intend to follow the fire brigade to the north and the National Association of fire brigade and rescue helicopter pilots have criticized the evacuation.
"He believes that they should take further steps in this situation.
He is preparing for further steps in this situation.
" There will be more flights, " said Asmundur..
He says that he is convinced that the vast majority of the population wants more regional distribution of public institutions.
" He said that it was necessary to take further political decisions about the relocation of public jobs outside the country,, such as the relocation of the Housing and Building Agency to Husnøy, but he also took the example of other institutions that have been relocated outside the country and played a major role for the communities outside the country,, such as the relocation of the Norwegian Agricultural Agency to Husnøy and the relocation of the Land Mapping Agency to Akranes.
All the major events from the second day of the World Championships.
The 94th edition of the Iceland Athletics Championships ended at Thorsvold in Akureyri on the day.
A number of new records were set on the second day of competition.
The women's javelin competition was expected to be exciting, as Vigdís Jonsdottir from FH set the Norwegian record in 2014, which stood until May 2015, when Elisabet Rut Runarsdottir from ÍR broke the record.
Vigdís won back the national record earlier in the summer and has been in fantastic form in the second half of the season, and she has improved the national record three times during the season.
Elisabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and did not play in the match.
She had only one good throw of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the furthest in the competition, 60.08 meters in her final attempt, setting a new meet record.
Her world record, set earlier in July, was 62.69 metres and she was well short of it.
Guðrún Karitas Hallgrimsdottir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day but improved her best with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's competition, the FH athlete, Hilmar Örn Jónsson won with an easy victory. He set the competition record with a throw of 73.84 meters in his ninth throw.
His national record in the event is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic athlete and national champion in the discus throw, competed in the discus throw at Thorsvål in the previous day and competed in the hammer throw in the next day, which is his main event.
Ísland's record is 65.53 metres, set by Guðna Vals, who threw the furthest 59.13 metres in the day and secured victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw furthest in the day, he had one good throw that landed in second place with 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardottir, Iceland's champion in the long jump, won the long jump competition with an outstanding performance, Hafdís jumped the furthest 6.25 meters in the day which is just short of 40 centimeters from her national record.
In the women's 200 metre race, it was ÍR athlete Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadottir who was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds, but her national record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri, she won two gold medals in the 100 metre sprint and in the 4 x 100 metre relay, and also in the 4 x 400 metre relay in the day.
In the men's competition, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200 metre sprint with a time of 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Oliver Mána Samúelssen from Årmann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna won gold in both the 100 and 400 metre sprints the day before.
He is not punished for the 27 million krone Bitcoin harvest.
The Court of Appeal has rejected the claim of the Chief Inspector of Police, who demanded that a man be punished for not revealing his income from the sale of Bitcoin.
Nefndin comes to the conclusion that the head of the investigation department did not have a clear rationale for arresting the man.
In the verdict of the committee, it is stated that the tax inspector believed that the man had violated the law because of his income in the years 2016 and 2017.
He had over-estimated his income from the sale of his Bitcoin business by 27 million krones, either intentionally or due to gross negligence.
The man was sentenced for his behaviour.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
He went ahead with the idea of selling rafmynt for 27 million in 2016.
In the years 2009 and 2010, it was easy and cheap to acquire such hardware with a normal home computer.
He pointed out that when he sold the rafmyntina, the tax for such a sale had been grossly unclear and unforeseeable.
It was not possible to anticipate that ordinary citizens would become aware of such arrangements in the allocation of taxes.
He had not intended to avoid paying the tax on the harvest and had made clear his ownership of the property on his account as an asset.
He tried to persuade both experts and the state tax inspector about how the situation was, but without success.
He believed that it was necessary to take account of the fact that he was neither born nor raised in Ireland and had only lived in the country for a few years when he started digging for gold.
He had therefore been in a worse position than others to understand the complex regulations that the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion on.
The man believed that his pay for the two income years would be reassessed and that he would be punished, but not otherwise.
He reiterated that he was working in Norway and had paid taxes in Norway since 2012.
He had never intended to escape from his obligations in a disreputable manner.
Krafan um sekt was out of all proportion and would throw him into debt.
" This man knows what football is about. "
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been widely criticized for his behavior towards people and has also received praise for his performance with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max division.
Blikar will be in the firing line in the evening when they take on ÍA in a live broadcast on Stød 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is suspended from playing for four games due to four warnings during the season, and therefore does not play with a new haircut as in the games of the season so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla " on the top of his head for the game against HK the previous Friday, which HK won 1 – 0.
"He didn't know exactly who he was going to pay to, but he said that he was a better character in the game.
He did not go into hiding.
Hann wants to get the ball every time and if there was someone to equalize the match, he would make it or create it. said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stadium when talking about Brynjolff.
"I will be there for the people. "
"It is sometimes difficult to figure out what position he is in.
Hjörvar Hafliðason said that he has a more or less free role in the team. When the game starts, he starts to move more to the left.
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says that Brynjolf is a real character and that he is happy to have this character in the league. " There is no disagreement on this that he is a character.
This is a fun personality and he likes to wear his hair, and he is always ready to meet and respond in interviews.
It is incredible that many people are fascinated by him, which shows that this man knows what football is.
" he is a comedian.
I's to be there for the people and have fun with it.
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólf and people are paying in and watching what comes next on his hair.
Þessi man is a genius, " said Máni.
The player of KR says he wants to leave the club - " He has been in contact with several teams in the second division. "
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in the Pepsi Max division, seems to be on his way out of the team.
According to the Danish newspaper Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Fótbolti.net also reported on the case..
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country,, but first he has to terminate his contract with KR, as the Danish league starts earlier than the Norwegian one.
Félagið veit that he misses Denmark and has shown him a lot of understanding,, said Tobias in an interview with Bold.
" He has been in contact with a number of teams in the second division and is likely to move to another team before the end of the Norwegian season.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay the salary of the contract he has with KR.
He says that he will have to take a salary cut in Denmark.
"Félags in Denmark have probably found more for the economic effects of the virus than in Iceland. "
Hjolvessel Bjartmar has recovered millions of hjols after the DV coverage. now he has to defend himself against the DV coverage.
In the past year, Bjartmar Leósson has had an interest that is different from most others.
He climbs up and rescues lost and stolen riding horses, racing horses, motorcycles and helicopters..
He has earned himself the nickname " the Hitchhiker " for his travels.
In the past,, there was a large flock of birds when a man told the story of his relationship with Bjartmar..
The DV reported that Bjartmar had spoken to a man on the streets of Oslo and told him that he might have been stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the pilot, other than that Bjartmar had stolen him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the beginning of the original DV report has been altered to match it.
Bjartmar says that the original reports of the incident were not reflective of what actually happened on the 1st of August at Austervelt.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from the victim of a rape of a rape victim that these were indeed his rape victims.
The information he received from the alleged owner was false, Bjartmar says.
"He saw the cows and he knew that there was a trailer that had been missing for a long time and that a search had been carried out for it.
I hesitated for a while, but when he saw that he was preparing to take off in a helicopter, he decided to confront the man..
The owner was convinced of his innocence and decided to have a conversation with the man.
Almennt, he goes very well in such matters,, but before he managed to complete what he had to say, the man had taken away his words..
Bjartmar says that the man on the helicopter offered him to show him the ticket for the helicopter and called the police himself.
"Já, flott, " said Bjartmar, " few get it straight. "
The owner of the helicopter proved his ownership of the helicopter and took off.
He said that the owner of the helicopter told his story on Facebook, similar to what was reported in the first report.
Bjartmar says that in the 18 months that he has been involved in this activity, he has been able to count the number of times that he has been involved in fights with people on the other side.
" He has had peaceful relations with the most difficult men in Reykjavik,, he said, and pointed to the fact that bicycle racers are often the smallest brothers and sisters of society,, fighters, disabled people and other people who live on the streets.
" Fíknin is a hard landlord and, in one way or another, it is necessary to finance the next year, because he is a thief, it is easy to steal money. " says Bjartmar.
" His relationship with these people is so good that he has brought many of these good people with him in the team.
Dæmi are about people going into treatment and taking it on and then seeking help from him and assisting him with what he is doing. " he says.
In general, Bjartmars' interactions with horseback riders are on a courteous basis.
Some know of him and what he is doing and are willing to give him a passport, registration number of his bicycle and so on..
Horse theft is a major problem that has been neglected.
Ennfremor, Bjartmar says that the police have started to tell people to talk to him about stolen horses.
Bjartmar is not satisfied with the first reports of DV and says that he is not a self--appointed police officer in the pursuit of justice.
He is asked whether he is not yet fully on the ice with his actions, and that this is first and foremost the role of the police. Bjartmar says.
"The police are obliged to do this,, but the reality of the matter is that the police are not doing it.
He has, among other things, observed police officers driving away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She is completely innocent in these matters.
"When the police are not doing anything in this, and it is just in front of the nose of the person,, and experience has shown that he has achieved success in this group of cases,, he says Bjartmar.
I says that he has achieved so great success in finding stolen wheels that he sometimes meets his " sheltered " on the streets, that they have only Bjartmari's wheels.
The times that Bjartmar has called on the police for assistance have come to the point that she has not met them.
"This is not working with the police, and it is not the police's fault and it is not the owners of the horse carriers ' fault in this case. " said Bjartmar and it is believed that the victims of horse carriage theft are suffering from the lack of police action in this case.
Bjartmars's achievements are not disputed.
Widespread stories exist of people thanking Bjartmari for returning their property to them..
Sjálfur says Bjartmar has long since lost track of the number of horses he has given away, but the numbers are said to be in the millions, if not tens of millions.
Vega there jet engines, jet planes and heavy jet planes, but jet planes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works until the end of the day at a kindergarten and every other week he works at a commune.
His horse riding career is a hobby that he pursues in his spare time.
Lifeyrissjøds and long shadows.
In 2019, a number of anniversaries were celebrated in the history of the labour welfare associations in Iceland.
The embættismen had received after- retirement pay from the Danish king all years of the 19th century, but in 1919 the embættismen's after retirement fund was established, which eventually became the after retirement fund of all public employees.
The foundation of the current general labourers' welfare organisations was laid in 1969 with the signing of a general labourers' welfare agreement, which stipulated the establishment of welfare organisations with mandatory membership and full--fledged welfare organisations from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were established on the basis of these agreements, and the welfare system continued to grow after that.
It was not the only radical change that the labour movement of the 20th century achieved through its struggle for wages.
In the famous strikes of 1955, the unemployed received them in the same way, and gradually gained their demands for welfare rights and sickness funds, significant overtime rights, improvements in housing conditions and other similar things.
All of these rights came at great cost and hard struggle, but in the end proved to be greater and more permanent than the increase in wages in the salary scale, which disappeared as soon as the post--war boom ended in the 1990s..
The prelude to the establishment of the general welfare organizations in 1969 was both long and complex.
In the end, men came together to agree that the funds were in fact the property of the union members, but the labour movement was forced to accept that the boards of the organisations would be made up of representatives from both the employers and the union members.
In the following years after the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers in the management of the funds was often the subject of debate in labour associations,, but it never reached a majority., and so the situation remains that representatives of workers are not in a majority in the management of the funds.
In the 36th paragraph of the 129th law of 1997 on the obligation to secure lifelong rights and the operations of the lifelong rights associations, it is mentioned that the lifelong rights associations have an investment policy.
It says in the first line of the 1st verse that " the welfare of the members of the welfare organization is at the center of the work of the welfare organization. "
It also says in the 5th line of the 5th verse that the Lifesavings Fund would set its own ethical standards in its investments.
In the hluthafastefne of the Lifeyrissjøds,, among other things, the following provisions are included, in the wake of the previous provisions.
Lifeyrissjøen is a member of the United Nations ( UN PRI ) regulations on responsible investments, along with many of the largest life savings societies and investors in the west and in Europe.
In the regulations, it is stated that the emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good governance in the management of companies, can contribute to better financial results.
In this way, the interests of the shareholders and the goals of the nation are combined in a wider context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those that are listed on the stock market, set a public agenda for good governance, working conditions and environmental issues.
The Labourers' Association, Gildi, has set its " policy on responsible investments " and there are provisions of similar nature.
This is all recounted here as an introduction to the latest fashion in the Norwegian language, " shadow government " .
In the case of orðiated in the language, it is not likely that it has been fully defined, but it seems that the following definition is " most taken " . Shadow leadership is when the leader of a trade union says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the union to the board of the welfare fund with instructions or instructions on how they should take a position in a particular matter.
If they do not follow the instructions, they will be dismissed from the government at the first opportunity.
Ef the foremost man does not use this in the media and does not talk about resignation, it is not, however, " shadowy leadership " and these kinds of relationships are common in the business world.
It is the author's intention to make the reader think about which is the " darker path " .
There are only two men who have tried to shape this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of 25 July 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at the newspaper Fréttablade, and Asgeir Jonsson, Director of the State Bank.
In both cases, the reason was after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants ( to fire them ) and Ragnar Þór Ingolffsen, chairman of the Verslunarmannafelag Reykjavik, sent out the suggestion to the representatives of the company in the board of the Lifeyrissjøk of Reykjavik that they would not support the possibility of the union buying shares in the company, otherwise they would be fired.
Nokkru later, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and in the wake of this, Ragnar Þór withdrew his recommendations which were based on the decision of Bogi Nils.
In contrast, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to talk about the matter in the Friday edition of the newspaper Fréttablaðen with large words about shadow governance, lawbreaking and the need for changes to the law.
There was a little spider that rolled a heavy load, though the blessed spider was in a dangerous position and was drying up quickly.
Þar as the matter is of great importance, they should focus on the substance itself at the end.
He examined the parts of the law that relate to this matter.
In these, it is stated that the board of trustees must take care of the interests of the beneficiaries and have moral standards in their investments, and these are further specified in the agreements of the Gild and the Lifeyrissjøds..
Lifeyrissjøds are not obliged to focus solely on short--term profit in their investments.
This is exactly a dangerous course and it is not easy to find examples of this in the past,, where large sums of money from banks and funds were given to unscrupulous adventurers and environmental disasters with catastrophic consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was clearly on thin ice when he decided to fire a large group of employees and thus significantly weakened the company's position on the Icelandic market and weakened its position with investors.
As it turned out, he saw that and pulled it back.
The time reveals that it is possible that the investments of the labour union's funds in the company can be considered to be a burden to the union's members.

I was one of the survivors who did not have a homecoming ceremony.
I was one of the three who were diagnosed with the disease in the country on the 15th of July last year, for about one and a half weeks.
He is an Icelander who is not permanently resident in the country, and did not receive clear instructions about the use of the home country's immigration policy after his arrival in the country and a few days after his arrival..
He was rejected by the border guards.
" He is in the Norwegian society and in fact he is supposed to be in this kind of treatment while he is on vacation in the summer,, says Kamilla Josepsdottir, a specialist in the surveillance department at the Ministry of Health, in a conversation with the newspaper Fréttablade in the day.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the kennel numbers and if the kennel numbers are not registered, they are not called for the second round. "
Hún says that the man used the English registration form because he is in fact resident abroad, but because of his ties to Norway he should have used the Norwegian form.
He has not yet grasped this..
"When the kennitalan is not registered, he has to seek it himself in the second test..
Hvorki he and his employer realized that it was the right way. "
"This means that it is clear that there is a need to increase the information given about this while they try to find a way to make self--identification systems without registering the nationality of their citizens..
Eða það is a way to make it more clear who is a participant in the Icelandic society in the registration system..
As it turns out, the person who arrived in the country did not become a part of the Icelandic society, even though he was classified as a participant in the Icelandic society..
Only six were sent into quarantine after he was diagnosed the day before, and these six were all in a relationship with him.
They are to be tested, but two of them are already showing symptoms of the disease..
The man received negative results from his test at the border on the 15th of July.
Kamilla says that it is likely that he had been recently infected with the virus, that he had not been able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not rule out the possibility that the man was infected in Iceland, but did not carry the infection to the country.
"It is not possible to say that it is an imported infection because it has been a long time since he came to the country and that he could have been exposed to it in the same way as the two who caused a small outbreak in connection with athletic competitions. "
It says, however, that it is very unlikely due to the small number of men in the area.
"It is, in fact, very unlikely, " says Kamilla, but it is not possible to rule it out until the Institute of Genetics has analyzed the virus in the man.
"If a new strain of the virus is introduced, it is almost certain that it was brought to the country. "
Piparspreyi and grenades are used against protesters.
In the night, there was a conflict between the police and the protesters in Seattle.
The police used pepper spray and non-- lethal grenades on the protesters, but the protesters broke windows and set off grenades.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.

Solskjær says that this is not the match that defines the season.
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the match against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game and Chelsea does not lose to Wolves,, Solskjær and his men end up in 5th place and miss out on the Champions League.
They would have a chance to reach the Champions League by winning the Europa League in the next month.
"They are not at the end of the road.
Ef að they win against Leicester, people say that they have not had a bad season. " said Solskjær.
"Whatever happens, this is not the end of their journey, because they still have a lot of ground to make up on the two teams above them. " said Solskjær.
It is clear that the tendons of men are twisted at 15 o' clock in the day but Solskjær tried to make it as if it was a normal match.
"If a man wants to belong to Manchester United, he has to endure being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is not new,, and it is based on this..
I have set up the team for a great end to the season and now it's up to the players to take advantage of it.
"This is not the most important game of the season, it is only the next game.
He can ask anyone in football, that the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define the season of the team, they have already had many moments that define this season.

I are afraid of the second wave of the epidemic.
The Spanish government is now trying to stop the spread of the disease in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of the disease on Thursday and Friday.
Þar have not been more than 100 new cases in one day since the beginning of May, and the news comes at the same time as Spain begins to lift the strictest outgoing ban in Europe.
This led to the fact that the British authorities forced the passengers who came from Spain to go into quarantine upon their return to the United Kingdom.
Viku was previously on the British list of safe countries..
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the north--east of Spain, where the authorities have taken widespread measures to try to stop the growth.
In the capital of Barselóna, the entertainment venues are closed for the next two weeks and nightclubs are closed at midnight.
This ban is now in effect for 200,000 inhabitants of Segria County in the western part of Catalonia..
It is believed that the decision of the British will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is affected by the aftermath of the plague.
Tui, the largest airline in Britain, cancelled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands on the day.
The governments of many countries are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but little enthusiasm has been shown to reinstate the widespread outbreak ban.
In addition, Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken a very negative attitude towards nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
The Prime Minister of France, Jean Castex has said that the nation " would not survive economically or socially " if the ban was reintroduced.
A number of ministers believe that the localized measures that reach the inhabitants of individual villages, towns and areas will be enough to prevent the spread of the virus in the next round.

He was a participant in the athletic clubs in Reykjavik and according to the announcement, he was " only a part of the athletic team " .
Others who were sent to solitary confinement are related to the man in other ways.
The origin of the infection is unknown and the tracing of the infection is in full swing with the police's surveillance team.
The organizers of the World Cup have followed the guidelines and regulations of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Defense, and have made the necessary arrangements.
However, the pictures of the match from the previous day attracted attention as they showed the players in close proximity celebrating their good performance on the pitch.
Just before 11 o' clock in the day, the organizers released a statement on their Facebook page.

The town of Patreksfjordur says that the camping site is overbooked for the holiday period. The number of visitors has doubled.
The camp in Patreksfjord is fully booked during the weekend, according to a statement from Vesturbyggd.
The audience was advised to look at other accommodation options.
Nefnir Vesturbyggd, Bíldudal, Tálknafjord, Melanes on Rauðsand and Fløkalund and Breiðavik as other alternatives in the station.
There is a lot of activity in Patreksfjord during this weekend,, because as in previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Norwegian home movies is held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
The number of visitors to the tents is expected to be high this year, if the weather does not interfere with the calculation,, but DV said earlier in the day that the weather forecast was bad.
However, the worst weather is expected in the south, and hope for Patreksfjord.
Vefurinn bb.s said first, and said that all other accommodation in the city were already full.
Heilt fjölbýlishus fell down on the best place in the city.
Romanian workers live freely on Dunhaga 18 – 20.
In the meantime, the owners are seeking building permits for renovations, but their requests have been delayed by the bureaucracy in the third year.
In one of the oldest, most ancient and most expensive neighborhoods of the city of Reykjavik, stands a multi--story housing complex.
In the basement of the house, there are about 600 square meters of warehouse space.
In front of the house, there are two staircases, each of which contains four fairly large apartments..
They are between 93 and 130 square metres,, although most are over 100.
The house has a significant history.
It was built in 1959 and has also housed a video rental, the Mjolkursamsolen's butter factory, the Jøa cannon foundry and most recently the University Press.
The house has, so far as it is possible to say,, been a place of great beauty..
The house is now badly damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 are, according to the company register, Magnus Magnusson and Guðrún Helga Lárusdottir.
Magnus was a member of the board of Borgun and was the chairman of the ownership company Borgun.
In the group of owners of the Borgun company, is Stalskip.
Stålskip AS is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdottir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third of D18.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, ran the shipping company Stálskip.
The house was bought in the summer of 2009 and has been neglected since then.
The neighbors say that the condition of the house has deteriorated continuously since the 1990s, though most of the deterioration occurred in the 2000s.
The house has not been " particularly lively " in the last few years.
It can be played in that the owners have been trying to change the house and the land for a number of years.
The other neighbors say that the house has not been in good condition for a long time.
"It is long overdue to do something about this hole and it is a shame that it has dragged on for so long. "
Segir hann jafnfratically that he is fed up with the owners of the house for not forcing him to finish the project and find a common ground with his neighbors..
"To do this, in cooperation with the community in the surrounding area, so that it is possible to drive the project and complete it. "
"Lögfræedistappi " that the resident refers to is the planning process of the site, which has been in progress since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 applied for permission to build a new building on top of the existing housing complex and behind the house, a new elevated house and an annex on one floor. .
The building permit granted for the project was overturned by the Supreme Court on the grounds that the construction was not in accordance with the district plan and that the preliminary examination was inadequate.
The municipality of Reykjavik started work on the district plan and finished it with an announcement in the Stjornartidin newspaper in July of the previous year.
This arrangement was also condemned and dismissed by the committee in March 2020.
At this point, three years had passed since the original application for building permission and the owners of the house on the original site.
The house had fallen into disrepair and the neighbours were tired of it.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and their reactions, they responded in various ways.
Some understood the intentions of the house owners, others did not..
Others directed their rage at the city, others did not.
The others were angry but not out for revenge.
Others said that the parking areas were a mess, but neighbors have used the unused parking areas of Dunhaga 18 – 20 for their own vehicles..
Einn kærand in the case said that he was tired of the government.
"If they have to go through the process three times, it is unbelievable.
It is as if the city of Reykjavik could not read.
In the day, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
The ministry of the city's administration and the grand plans of the owner and many years of their work are at the beginning of the road.
When a reporter came to the garden at Dunhaga 18, the doors were thrown open and mounds of rubble appeared.
The Playstation and the new television lay among other rubbish on the ground - they were the sacrificial victims of Norwegian summer bonfires.
It was opened in the old printing room of the University, and there were a lot of cats with the smell of the land.
It is clear that someone has been hiding in one of the corners, but no one can be seen.
Stacks of sofas and mattresses, and a number of maps of geological maps were strewn across the floor..
The rooms of the house were also open and life was in both of them.
The reporter was so lucky to meet two of them.
There were Romanians cooking their potato soup in the evening and they invited a journalist to join them.
The Romanians are working for the workforce of the Strongforce company.
They have been there for some time and according to DV, the company has not paid for the house, only heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not feasible to collect rent.
It is clear from the positions of posters in the entrance of the house that there have been a large number of foreign workers in the house in the last few years.
The operation of the workman's union has not been affected by the Covid-19 situation, because the decline in tourism has led to a decline in the construction industry and these two branches have been the most active in using the workman's union.
In contrast, the household men at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty of work to do and they stayed in the workshops and warehouses until the end of the rainy day.
In spite of the poor condition of the house, the boy's room, which the boys shared, appeared to have been well maintained.
When the newspaper reporter asked the Romanian boys, he suddenly became cold--headed. At the best place in Reykjavik, stands a 1,500 square metre property that has been severely damaged.
The owners want to change the house to improve it, and the neighbors disagree on the definition of " improvement.
In the middle is the city's planning area at the start of the planning process, the endless number of appeals and court proceedings in the planning process and the rapid removal from the planning process by the Supreme Court of Norway.
In the house, live Romanian workers,, possibly those who are working to improve the situation when the Norwegians leave..
The article originally appeared in the Sunday edition of DV on 17 July.
In the aftermath of the coronavirus epidemic, a campaign against overweight was launched.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds in a campaign against obesity, which includes a ban on fast food advertisements after he suffered a serious illness partly due to his weight.
In the meantime, Johnson was scheduled to launch his campaign, on Monday,, with the campaign being called the " Better Health " campaign, and with the campaign calling on doctors to advocate for the use of wheelchairs for hospitalized patients.
The broadcasting of advertisements for fast food restaurants in television is prohibited after 21:00 in the evening according to British media sources.
" Coronavirus has made them aware of the risk of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined to use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthy food. "
Johnson has himself struggled with weight problems, and he was admitted to hospital in the spring of 2012 after being diagnosed with the corona virus. It is partly because of his weight that he is considered to have been so severely affected by the disease.
Women are better suited to lead the changes.
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation could take in the direction of greater decentralization, transparency and in the fight against corruption and the interests of the whole nation.
"It is necessary to change the gear somewhat now and that group of society that is better suited to lead this change is the one that is more inclined to be in this mood..
Það was women, " said Helga.
" Women in Iceland are famous for their feminism.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
This means that now it is only up to them to lead these changes.
She said that she was a little uneasy about the emphasis on Iceland as " the best in the world " in terms of gender equality and human rights.
"Then, they are not ready to examine what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and look back on all that has happened.
Það is a lot.
They have to know where they are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listening to the voices of marginalized groups.
I don't live in the same rules as all here, said Helga.
When asked, she said that women are in many ways in good shape in Iceland, but added that, like in many other places, the Icelanders live in a male- dominated society.
She said that politics revolved around personal interests, dominance and power, which were the forces that perpetuated misrule in all societies.
"The women have now formed a group and come together and they are frustrated that Alþingi is ignoring the 2012 vote. "
"It is these feminine qualities that they are thinking about.
From the point of view of human rights and nature protection,, and the fact that they all sit at the same table,, she said and added that these were the founding principles of the new constitution.
" The country is rich in natural resources and it is unfathomable that there are people living in poverty.
Það is far-fetched, it is possible to split in a different way, said Helga.
"It is far-fetched that there is a natural law that women's jobs are always paid less.
It is unfathomable that flight attendants and nurses have to fight endlessly for wages that are equal to those of men.
It is possible to sign under the new constitution of the Kingdom of Norway through electronic Norway.

It is possible to stay in the house of Monet during the summer holiday..

The next free nights in the house are around the summer holiday.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy in France.

Tugir in quarantine and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Fimm have been diagnosed with the corona virus in the last three days and are most of them infected.
They are in quarantine because of this, and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people were diagnosed with the coronavirus in the past day and two at the border checkpoint.
A specialist from the Ministry of Health says that the increasing number of domestic transmissions does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in society.
"It has been analyzed from the first domestic infection and it is a virus that has not been seen in Norway before, so there is no reason to believe that it has been present in society for a long time.
This is probably something that has been introduced to the country recently, but it is necessary to be on high alert now. " said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdotter, a specialist in the surveillance department of the Embassy of the Landlord.
The majority of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further surveys are to be carried out in the near future, but some of those who were in contact with the infected have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now, there is no influenza epidemic, and there are fewer cases of other airborne diseases, so they are able to be a little more liberal with this., " said Kamilla.
The search is mostly completed, it is not out of the question that more people will have to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected were identified after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions about whether it is appropriate to hold such events.
The head of the Norwegian Civil Defence Agency says that it is possible for as long as people follow the guidelines and regulations.
Kamilla says that it is almost impossible that the infected were infected at athletic events.
"If there are not more people in isolation from these individuals after having been in contact with them at these sporting events, they can claim that their anti-- infection measures have been effective.
Það has not been revealed, " said Kamilla.
The Ministry of Defence is in a constant state of re-assessment.
"We have to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if the situation calls for it. " said Kamilla.
After about a week, the number of people to be detained will be increased to 1,000.
This new position may have had an impact on the easing of restrictions.

Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle.
The municipal authorities in Seattle in the state of Washington have declared a state of rebellion in the aftermath of the large--scale protests in the city centre.
Police used tear gas and pepper spray to try to clear a large area that protesters had taken over and stretched over several houses in the neighborhood of the parliament building.
The police announced on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into damage caused to a police station in the city on the previous day,, possibly by a bomb.
Police and law enforcement authorities say that protesters had thrown stones, bottles, grenades and other objects at the police and that one police officer was taken to a hospital with injuries.
The demonstrations in Seattle were, however, peaceful for a long time.
They were sent to Portland, Oregon to show that there was unity among the protesters, as in this city, there has been repeated clashes between protesters and armed units of the state police.
There,, like in many cities in the United States, people gather together under the banner of Black Lives Matter and commemorate the death of George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on 25 May, and protest against the institutional racism in the American society.
It was not recalled until after the vote.
It is not yet clear whether the dismissals of the Icelandair flight attendants, which are to take effect in the next month, will be revoked.
The rafræn vote of the Icelandair flight attendants's union for the Icelandair flight attendants ends at midday on the following day.
The chairman of the union, Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, says that Icelandair will not make a decision about the dismissals until the voting results are known.
"It is clear that they are connected. " says Guðlaug Líney.
" There have been no cancellations, the situation is such that it is possible to man the planes.
As a result, people are desperate to find out whether they will have a job after the end of the month.
It is about a contract that was signed the day before the 19th of July, in the afternoon of the 18th of July.
It is planned that it will last until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract that flight attendants had previously voted on.
On 17 July, the board and the trustees of the Icelandic Airline Association voted to call a general strike at Icelandair, and the members of the association voted in favor of the strike.
Icelandair's decision to terminate negotiations with the Flight Attendants Association and to dismiss all its flight attendants and seek a new agreement with another union was the result of a decision made in the wake of a decision by Icelandair to terminate negotiations with the Flight Attendants Association and to dismiss all its flight attendants and seek a new agreement with another union.
The airmen of the company were to take on the duties of the security forces on board on a temporary basis.
She says that it is difficult to predict the outcome of the vote.
"People are suffering after this attack on Icelandair, when all of the airline's flight attendants were dismissed and announced that a new union would be formed.
It is now revealed that it has an effect, " she says.
940 flight attendants worked at Icelandair at the end of April, when 900 of them were laid off, 95 percent of them..
Uppsagnarfrestur for those who have the shortest working life is three months and ends at the end of the month of July and August..
In the group there are about 90% of the flight attendants of Icelandair.
What will happen if the agreement is not accepted.
"They want to continue negotiations with their partners.
With this agreement, Icelandair is meeting the demands of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that flight attendants have gone too far.
The vote on the labor agreement is over and Icelandair announces the results of the first quarter of the year on the following day.
The vote of the flight attendants on the new contract ends at 12 o'clock in the morning.
Uppgjör Icelandair for the second quarter will also be published on the morning, but the emergency revenue of the company has fallen by 85 percent compared to the same period in the previous year.
The rafræn voting for the agreement between the Icelandic Flight Attendants Association and the Association of Industries started on Wednesday, 22 July and ended on Monday, 27 July at 12 o'clock in the morning.
Those who can vote on the agreement are employees of Icelandair who pay membership fees to the Flight Attendants' Association.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective agreement on the night of 19 July, after the airline terminated negotiations with the union in early July after flight attendants rejected a previous agreement in a vote.
Icelandair had dismissed all of its flight attendants and flight crew on Friday, but they were reinstated after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to the new contract, flight attendants have to fly five times more per month for the same salary.
The Kjarasamning agreement is valid until 2025, but there is an agreement between flight attendants and flight attendants about how long they can fly on one shift.
The agreement was introduced to the members of FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel the previous Monday and many of the flight attendants interviewed by the news agency were dissatisfied with the agreement.
Most of them agreed that it was necessary to accept the agreement in order to keep the federation alive.
Uppgjör for Icelandair for the second quarter will be announced in the morning, that the airline's operating profit, its revenue from fares and taxes, is negative by 100 to 110 million US dollars or 15 million Norwegian krones.
Icelandair sent the Court of Appeal an emergency revenue report the previous Wednesday, stating that the company's revenue had reached 60 million dollars in the fourth quarter or 83 million Norwegian krones.
In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's assets were worth 154 million US dollars, around 21 million Norwegian krones.
Icelandair is also planning to sell off a portion of the company's shares in August.
Icelandair is aiming to sign contracts with 15 airlines, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before the airline's shares are sold.
A new variant of the virus rather than a new species of the virus.
"The new virus means that the person came from abroad.
Þese reports of a new strain of the virus have been circulating in Norway, says Már Kristiansen, chief physician of the Norwegian Institute of Infectious Diseases.
Three domestic transmissions were detected and two at the border.
A person who was diagnosed had taken part in the social activities of a football club at a football tournament called the Rey Cup,, but the source of the infection was not found and the spread of the infection is being monitored.
The disease was also found in a person who came to the country on 15 July, and two people who were in contact with him started to show symptoms of the disease.

The transmission of the disease is completed in connection with the transmission of the disease.
Már states that it is not a new virus, that it is the same virus that has spread around the world.
It is more accurate to talk about a new variant of the virus rather than a new species of the virus.
It is not known what this means and whether it can say anything about the start of a second wave of the disease. According to Mår,, as is the case with isolated events,, it is not possible to say anything more about it.
"However, in the event of cases occurring within the country that are not related to foreign sources and are of the same genotype as this particular strain, it is possible to draw the conclusion that it is a second wave, but it is premature to do so at this time. "

It is a long way to get 100 days in the elections.
100 days are until the Americans go to the election and choose their president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re--election, but he is on the back foot.
Biden is ahead of Trump in the race for the Democratic nomination, according to opinion polls.
According to a new survey by the Associated Press news agency, a large number of Americans believe that the country is heading in the wrong direction.
The response of Trump to the new coronavirus epidemic is also very unpopular and, in addition, more Americans than before believe that the president has mismanaged the economy.
Nine out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right path.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the outbreak and 48 percent say he has handled the economy well.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average of Five Thirty Eight, Biden has 49.9 percent of the vote nationally and 41.9 percent of the vote for Trump.
Trum himself has tried to divert attention from his failure in the face of the plague to Biden, to emphasize the so--called cultural conflicts and to promote policies based on laws and regulations.
Framboð Biden puts a lot of effort to keep the attention on Trump and believes that he has a great chance of winning if the election is actually about the fact that he has done a good job in the last four years..
The popularity of Trump is also expected to affect the members of the Republican Party and that the members of the Democratic Party may even gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
Politico said on the days that the party's and the candidate's popularity was similar and that the Republican Party would suffer its biggest decline in a century.
Uthverfi has proved to be a problem area for the party in the 2016 elections and this trend is likely to continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to frighten the inhabitants of the suburbs to follow him,, among other things, by saying that if Biden becomes president, he would destroy the suburbs of the United States and stir up racial conflicts.
Among other things, Trump has abolished a decree from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
Then he urged " housewives " in the outlying areas of the United States to read an article written by the former Secretary of State of New York, where she claimed that Biden would destroy the outlying areas of the United States and took Trump under it.
" Biden will destroy their neighborhoods and the American dream.
He would preserve it, and even make it better. " said the president.
The population of the outlying areas of the United States is constantly growing in the number of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
From 2004, when George W. Bush was re--elected,, the candidate with the most votes from this group has become president.
In 2012, Mitt Romney received more votes from this group than Barack Obama but lost to him.
Skoðanakannanir have shown that, despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the outlying areas in 2016, his popularity there has fallen dramatically.
Tho it var different between the candidates, Biden had a 15 percent advantage over Trump in the polls in the last few weeks.

The Olympic Games are the light at the end of the runway.
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, a sporting event that has only been affected by world wars,, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Games would be " the light at the end of the journey " and referred to the worldwide epidemic of the coronavirus that the world is going through in unity.
The athletes have an extra year to prepare and the Japanese authorities have increased their costs due to the postponement.
All of them hold on to the house, though they are in dire need of money.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympic Games in 2008, the celebrations of the Japanese delegation were disrupted.
They shouted and shouted back and forth until they decided to hold the games in Tokyo in 2016, but it was decided in favor of Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were in the limelight of the world.
The matches were scheduled to be played from 24 July to 9 August but were postponed for a year and started on 23 July 2011 and ended on 8 August 2011.
If it is not possible to hold the Games, if the coronavirus is still a threat, the Games will be cancelled.
No one, however, wants to think the thought to the end.
The Olympic Games are not the usual type of athletic competition..
It is not spared, the show is always to be spectacular and the aim is to top the previous show.
The choice of the host city for the Olympic Games is based on the assessment of the selection committee on the presentation of the cities.
The more impressive the presentation - the more likely to win the prize.
Oslo was awarded 150 million Norwegian krones to try to hold the Olympics in 2016, equivalent to 20 million Norwegian krones.
In the second time,, when they applied for the 2020 Olympics, they spent 75 million dollars, 100 million Norwegian krones on the preparations.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the Games in 2012,, the Japanese government allocated approximately 30 million krone to the project.
En the amount is only a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of building the Olympic village, the competition venues and preparing the country to host the games, as well as holding the games themselves.
The organizers in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which had been scheduled to take place that year but had been postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 126 million dollars.
In the report from the state inspector in Japan, which came out at the end of the year,, however, it was revealed that the cost was nearly double that figure.
It is not possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the matches,, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six million dollars in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could be as high as 15 to 30 million dollars.
There are so high numbers that all of Norway's tax revenue is only enough for about half of the total cost of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of scrutiny by economists, who have examined the impact of the games on the economy.
In short, it seems that many have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games on the economies of the cities that host them is less positive than negative.
Short- term effects are some,, for example, the number of jobs has increased dramatically in the short term, but in the longer term, cities are often plagued by overcrowding and high operating costs of unused buildings.
The city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil has large debts due to the 2016 Games and has struggled to maintain all of the large athletic facilities built for the Games.
10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
It means that no new jobs were created, only to a small extent.
In general, cities have not come out well financially from hosting the Olympics due to the high cost of building facilities for the games.
However, there is often considered to be an increase in the number of tourists visiting the Olympic host cities in the wake of the games,, but there is much uncertainty surrounding the 2021 games.
It is also unclear whether it is possible to accommodate all of the large number of spectators who normally attend the games.
The main thing, however, is the honor of being chosen,, but it is difficult to assess it in terms of money.
In spite of the enormous cost, it is also possible to say that the joy that the actors bring is not of the same nature as that which can be put on a scale.
The show is often spectacular, there is no shortage of money, but the show is not only about money..
It is the athletes who are in the foreground.
For some of the athletes, the postponement of the games is just a blessing.
The Australian pentathlon athlete and gold medalist in her event at the 2008 Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is a single and has been away from good form in the summer but hopes to be in competitive form for the 2012 Olympics.
She is one of the athletes who is more content with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who had planned to retire after the Games, the postponement of the Games in some cases meant that they were able to continue to compete.
He does not trust his body to go through another year of strenuous training.
Few athletes captured the hearts of spectators at the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 as much as the gymnast Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has met in several interviews in her home country of the United States to discuss the Olympic Games.
She intends to participate in the 2021 Olympics, but she is not certain that she would be at the top of the podium at the 2012 Olympics, because she is 24 years old.
Although it is not generally considered to be a high age, it is in a higher level for the top female athlete.
"This is a sensitive issue, " Biles says, but smiles in a second interview with the Olympic Committee's website.
"She does not know whether she will be on top of the podium after a year of training. "
She has previously said that her body is not able to handle the stress that comes with being a competitive athlete for a long period of time.
She continues to train hard for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles says that it has been a difficult feeling to have to stop training suddenly when the 2008 Olympic Games were at their peak and the gymnastics facility was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles, more than for other athletes while all athletic facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold medals could not be sold, she had to find various ways to keep herself in shape like other athletes.
The basic form is, in fact, slightly better than with most people.
" They have a strict plan now.
It was difficult to start training again after the gymnastics hall was opened again.
I started slowly but is coming on full throttle in the new season and he will increase his training as the year progresses.
I know for sure that these actors will be or that they will be held, but they are rehearsed based on the assumption that they will be held,, but they can't do anything else.
He has put too much pressure on himself to quit the sport now. "
With her, and others, there is a feeling of uncertainty about the possibility of the games being held in 2021 rather than 2020.
It is impossible to predict what will happen in the future.
The situation of the world's epidemic of the coronavirus is unknown in July 2021 and there is no other option than to prepare for the Olympic Games based on the assumption that they would be held in 2021.
It is possible that the Olympic Stadium is the light at the end of the Covid gang..
The wedding was postponed due to the plague.
The Modern Family actor Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams in the summer.
The actress said in an interview with People,, "I think there are other more important things to think about at the moment..
"I would like to get married to her at some point and have a dream wedding and have all the guests who are dear to them.
I decided to postpone it and focus on what is important at the moment and that is to help spread information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
He is more interested in world affairs than marriage at the moment.
There are a lot of things going on and it is important to focus on what is happening in the world.
