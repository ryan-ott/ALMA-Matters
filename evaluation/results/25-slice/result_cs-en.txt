Slavia promised Berbrovi a million for the title, Tvrdik denied this.
Prague - in the current corruption case, it was alleged that the former president of the Football Association of Romania, Roman Berbr had received a million koruna from Slavia for the league title in the 2018-19 season.
It was reported by the football newspaper efotball with this that it had received a part of the police records.
The president of the Vrşovian club, Jaroslav Tvrdik stated that the red and white players did not engage in corrupt activities.
The server released recordings of police surveillance, in which Slavia's former sporting director Jan Nezmar, who left the club in the summer of 2014, was a central figure.
One of the most influential members of the Communist Party was in frequent contact with both Berbrem and the former sports director of the second division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogozem,, who is also involved in the case.
Criminalists apparently worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi had promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the team of SK Slavia won the title in the first league.
The police organization had the information that the victory in the league had given Roman ( Berbr ) a million-aire bonus from the Slavia club officials..
One day later, according to the criminalists, Berbr met not only with Nezmare, but also with Slavie Tvrdiik's president.
However, it is not known whether the police are still investigating this information.
Tvrdik rejected all forms of corruption.
In the years 2015 to 2017, they actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
They have never committed an illegal act, have not sought to influence the referees in a way contrary to the rules of fair play and have not received any financial compensation in connection with this. " stated Tvrdik for Seznam Zprávy.
In the aftermath, Nezmar did not hesitate to disparage some of Slavia's former black players and also criticized his predecessor Tvrdi.
The investigation of the alleged influence of referees on matches started in the middle of October with a police raid on several locations, including the FAČR headquarters in Bucharest.
The most prominent figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football functions.
In the middle of January, he was dismissed from his position as head coach of Vyšehrad..
Helicopters, tanks and armored vehicles are used to reenact Cold War battles.
The new tanks are of a different type, of a lower quality ( they have armored gun turrets and are armed with hand--held shells without armor protection ).
Auta - Toyoty hi-lux - are new and good.
Tank and armored vehicles - on a decent level, in addition, they have managed to get rid of the Pragy V3s and in specialized units..
Airplanes - good, but at the end of the contract, in terms of transport, very small and with a short flight range, but modern.
Drones - small and weak types with no combat potential.
Rackets - they do not have any ( but they are manufactured and exported to other countries )
PVO - medium - cold, outdated, short range - good, modern and relatively good numbers.

On the other side, it was not a war, it would have required a large number of coincidences for something to happen, and it would have been seen in thermal vision, which is almost universal today.
So, in a visible place, expensive things were placed in his shoes and he would have been in a good mood.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Ministry of Defense was able to procure the respirators at a much lower cost than the Ministry of Health.
The state responsible for the purchase and distribution of roušes, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus has spent millions of crowns on their production in the past weeks.
The Serbian Radio compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the amount of respirators differed by hundreds of crowns in a single day.
The reason for the dramatic change of prices.
The authorities that behaved hospodarically.
Others bought it for more money.
Lenka Kabrhelová talks with the reporter of the iRozhlas Dominikou Kubištov.
Soldiers and armies are honored ( but the younger generation cannot benefit from compulsory military service, and the Republic is unable to benefit from compulsory military service.
They do not have large stocks of technical equipment, which could be used by the reservists, they do not have modern equipment for the existing professionals, and modern equipment is still more difficult, so the reservists' skills are rapidly decreasing in time.
In addition to the modern conventional conflicts,, which can be carried out very quickly,, there is no time for them to be rehearsed again.
In the end, the reserve forces and territorial defense have a great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerilla warfare can be conducted and it is also a necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the struggle is only carried out in a conflict of this magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla is irrelevant and has no suitable geography.
They lack individual skills.
This is not the worst..
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they have.
Then, such a situation occurred, that a man who missed the empty goal 2 minutes earlier ran into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss players and said, " it's a goal and that is what is going to happen. ".
It is obvious that the average tax-paying citizen voted for him..
The situation with this kind of skill " to provoke the defender " is so terrible that he has been surprised to see that the opponent's attacker was able to surround one of the opponent's players.
The first eagles.
The Covid pandemic is slowing, but no major change is expected in the following weeks.
The onslaught in hospitals is expected to continue for some time and, as is known, the new and unknown variant of omicron, which is expected to spread more rapidly than the currently predominant Delta.
On the other hand, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty that it can cause a more serious course of the disease, to the extent that it can be countered by vaccination or post-- infectional immunity gained from previous infection.
However, this week, a new phenomenon also appeared on the plus side, the possibility of healing.
A new antiviral drug, molnupiravir has arrived in Czechia, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and the associated hospitalization by a third, and it is possible to treat it at home.
He would also have complemented it with the antibiotic paxovid from the company Pfizer, which announced a success rate of 85 percent from the initial results.
The first shipment of molnupiravir to Croatia, in addition to the possibility of expanding the arsenal of useful weapons in the fight against the coronavirus epidemic, also highlighted the question of how the new arrivals were prepared by the Croatian administration.
It was announced that the first batch of molnupiravir would be delivered to domestic patients by the Merck company.
The company was the first to develop the vaccine because it started working on it long before the outbreak of the current pandemic with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for viral diseases affecting horses in the southern hemisphere..

On the second grade of the elementary school, he had a classmate, Cigana, for four years.

Lukáš Neuheil has ordered from abroad several times a month.
He focuses mainly on collecting cards.
" Normally, it can be tens of dollars,, e.g. from 10 dollars high,, where it is still profitable to import from Japan,, where the post is often free. "
Since October, the cost of small shipments has increased slightly, they must now add DPH and submit information to the customs.
He receives a letter from the customs that they expect the package to arrive.
It is enough to record the details of the shipment and if the DPH was not included in the initial sale, the customs office reimburses the total amount of the shipment and the transport.
In the event that the recipient does not take care of the customs control himself, the total amount must also be increased by the compensation of the transport company.
According to Lukáše Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
He presses one or two of the buttons, inserts two strips and is finished.
For him, it is usually a matter of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
Not all deliveries, however, go smoothly.
Due to new customs rules, the daily number of accepted shipments from abroad at the international post in Prague fell from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, it is also a problem that people do not respond to requests to provide information that is necessary for the completion of customs procedures..

I could not explain why the perpetrators of violence were sent to prison for only six months.
This is beyond his head, that a court can send such a beast to prison for only six months, only because it has done it again.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that its victim will suffer trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
It is not to say that both victims of rape will never recover from it..

The man from Hrobu " killed " his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The man from Hrobu unintentionally helped the guards to detain his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who had been issued an arrest warrant.
She was called to it by him.
But he went on anyway..
He first approached passers-by and invented a story that he had been robbed.
After being called to the emergency line, the guards arrived at the scene and were stunned when the alleged " robbed " told them that he invented the robbery in order for the guards on the scene to arrive.
In fact, he wanted the police officers to give him advice on how to report to the Police of the Republic of Croatia..
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the guards discovered that the woman is on the list of wanted persons and is being pursued throughout the country.
The case is being investigated by the police.

Such a case would not be considered as the true faith.
Tady with Pascalem, they cannot agree that there are approximately 10,000 different religions in the world.
Whose god or gods a person chooses.
He said that it is likely that in some of the thousands of religions, there is at least one god who is disliked by those who believe in other gods.
However, in the tenth verse, it is stated that there is no other God than the God of Jahve.
In this case, it would have been more rational to stay with the belief in any god, rather than risking that he would be sent to the pekel or some other similar place..
Voluntary training with subsequent deployment to the reserve.
The Swiss model is probably similar..

It's funny that NATO is seen as something carved in stone and that they have allies who will protect them if they fail.

Like being trapped in a krabicovic tsunami.
The Christmas tree is decorated with gifts and suddenly the house is filled with boxes and cannisters.
This " waste " is again used by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
This was because of the map of the trade routes used by their used crab boxes.
It's not just for Christmas..
All of the packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a waste to treat them as one--time waste.
Anyone can deliver to the participating company ( the project's map contains almost 150 cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings ) a cardboard box, plastic or paper fillings.
Time supports small companies, reduces the amount of waste produced and also avoids overcrowded blue containers..
The single businesses welcome the shortage of packaging and the saved money, because the packaging cardboard has increased in price by 50 % over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded consumers, this also strengthens its brand.
One of these businesses is Tierra Verde, a producer of ecological drugs and ecological cosmetics.
Cases and filler material are transported by individuals who have accumulated them at home,, but also by firms, who have agreed to regular deliveries of discarded cardboard..
All of these are used in the packing of goods from the company's e--shop.

In the present day, technology is so simple and bumbling that children who use computers or play games on them do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem ( mainly in English newspapers ) has emerged that students at high schools do not understand the principles of the components of computers.
Because, for example, Google's photography or Apple 's applications on photography or, in general, mobile telephones generally conceal the underlying system of blocks and all of them are displayed on one screen in the application.
They can use the technique from childhood,, but mainly they need to learn something.
He is rewriting history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron announced his priorities for the French presidency of the European Union,, which begins in January,, and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for more than an hour, during which he revealed the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans in their work and on the streets, and mentioned a number of actions that could not be completed in half a year.
French politicians like it, and it is popular with voters.
Macron's supporters are divided between the right and the left, they agree on little but on Europe.
In France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities.
The French leader also mentioned that historians would write " one history of Europe " and that France was prepared to create the conditions for such work.
A number of commentators immediately criticized Macron for his pro-- European propaganda and for rewriting history.
In reality, he is trying to rewrite history in order to protect it.
The extreme right candidate for the French presidency, Eric Zemmour is currently touring France with his thesis that the regime of Vichy, which collaborated with Hitler during the Second World War, was not as bad, and has enjoyed considerable success among the French.
He took Macron's idea seriously and did not look at what was happening in France.
It was not necessary..
Students in European countries are often taught history as a story of heroes versus villains and never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, the French and the Czechs find out who defeated whom in the battles.

Trains began to run according to the new schedule, in some places, the carriers changed.
Since Sunday, trains are running according to a new timetable..
The biggest change is the replacement of Czech Railways on some routes, such as between Ústím nad Labem and Kolin,, where Regiojet takes over.
In most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, sometimes the route as well.
There are also hundreds of new trains on the tracks..
The sale of tickets began among the carriers during the autumn..
Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6,783 passenger flights per day and an average of 478 long--distance flights per day.
Trains travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to the domestic connections within the new flight schedule, they also fly to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Switzerland.
The company, together with the new flight schedule, introduced hundreds of new flights.
The main new feature is the Interjet flights, which fly from Prague to Chebu.
The other new routes of the transport company are to the north of the Moravian region or in the western part of the country.
The airline also traditionally increased the price of tickets by 3.2 percent on average..
The airlines take into account inflation in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in Regiojet's flight schedule is the introduction of line R23 from Ústi nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolin.
After the success of the competition of the Ministry of Transport, it replaced the Czech Railways.
Daily, RegioJet operates a total of 16 routes, eight in each direction.
The other changes involve long--distance flights between Prague and Brno, which now also stop at stations in Havelikov Brod, Žďar nad Sázavou and Kolin.

Passengers will also be able to use unified fares on the railways for the second year.
Similarly, the price of their tickets increased by 3.2 percent due to inflation.
He must not agree.
It is hard to see the other side..
Everywhere, they heard that they had to fight for their rights, that they were oppressed and had to struggle and die.
In his life, he has not heard any teachings from the point of view of slaveholders or from that time, no one defends it or condemns it.
No one says in schools that blacks often sold themselves into slavery themselves and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one in school teaches that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they only say that the brutal Europeans slaughtered them, but they had been killing each other for a long time.
For a while, he also spent time in the United States, at schools in the northern and southern parts of the country.
He has never been involved in deliberately falsifying facts,, but he has heard that this has been done and that it is a problem, which he does not deny. ( for example, in Japan, the horrors of World War II are still taboo. )
His main point was that history is not black and white and that it is viewed from a contemporary perspective without understanding.
History is not concerned with the feelings of the people, it is as it is, and he believes that it is a fatal mistake to condemn without consideration of the circumstances of the time.
On the other side, they would learn from it and this would never be repeated.
However, when they are in the southern states,, the confederate flag and the famous slave owners are quite popular there,, but they also had some of their own successes and it was absurd to reject them.
Navic was not as good as he is nowadays, as many people idealize him.
A large number of people also forget that not all people in the South were slave owners and that many things were against them.
This cannot be compared with the Russians, deliberately avoiding some facts, lies and manipulation, as well as the absence of the view of the Yugoslavs ( there was also a television video of a person who started to talk about the Yugoslav legionaries and 1968).
The most ridiculous thing he saw in American schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that never occurred in his country.
In general, he felt that at some universities, the students were radicalized and that the schools often supported them.
When he imagines that these people would be much older, he is not happy about the fact that this could be the voice of the majority because it is present among young people and in the ruling elite.
I feel that feminism has already reached that point, and that it is no longer the same, that it has been radicalized.
In the present, they are called feminists, those who have nothing in common with them and ignore the basic biological fact, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to opposition to quite reasonable things.
The more radical the person is,, the more he is heard..
On the other hand, he was not accused of colonialism or slavery.
More often than not, he had a bad sense of geography,, but he also had a good sense of geography.
It was not because he did not like it, but because he thought it was impossible.
I would be proud of something that he was not able to achieve on his own.

The Czechoslovian Church of the Hussites is there.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact they originated from the Catholic moderns and are in fact Catholic without a pope.
He knows many people who are Catholics, who attend the services of the Hussites because they are theologically similar, and the members are more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very important functionalist church on the street of Botanical.

California restricts the sale of weapons.
He wants to follow the path of Texas in the prohibition of abortion.
Governor of California Gavin Newsom announced the plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial abortion law enforced after detecting embryonic heartbeats.
People would then be entitled to compensation from anyone in California who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms.
Oznămia Newsama reacted to the American Supreme Court's decision to uphold the Texas ban on abortion, although it is against almost 50 years old precedent that established the right to abortion throughout the United States up to 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court has not yet decided on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on technical issues that arise from the innovative construction of the regulations.
In this case, enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, thus preventing the usual court route.
"I was disappointed by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States,, which allowed the continuation of the Texas prohibition of most abortion services and to a large extent supported the maneuver of Texas to protect its law. "
"Since then, states have been able to block revisions of their laws by federal courts, and California has used this privilege to protect human life. "
His subordinates were ordered to work together with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice to draft a decree that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so--called ghost weapons.
Theses weapons, produced underground, which do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants that citizens have the right to demand compensation of at least 10,000 US dollars (220,000 Kč) and court costs from anyone who manufactured, distributed or sold assault rifles in California, part of the " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the dead " or " weapons of the
"The most effective way to prevent these dangerous weapons from being used in the streets is to initiate private lawsuits,, he said, the governor of California.
The Associated Press notes that California has banned the production and sale of some military- style weapons for over a decade, a federal court judge overturned the ban as unconstitutional in June.
However, the state has now reinstated the use of Texas patterns, confirmed by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissenting opinion, which warned of the expansion of this legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the highest court of the state of Texas did not recognize complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against certain officials of the southern state of the United States of America.

Poland threatened to stop paying into the EU budget.
According to Ziobra, the European Commission violated the law when it used its new powers and because of the dispute over the legal state, it stopped paying money to Poland.
The Commission has already cancelled the approval of the Polish plan to receive 36 million euros from the European reconstruction fund affected by the pandemic of 2009.
A is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use the mechanism that allows it to withdraw EU funding from countries that violate the principles of the legal state.
"Polsko must respond to this bullying from the EU's old guard in all matters that require unity, " said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Party, without which the current government lost a tight majority in the Sejm.
"Polsko also needs to reconsider its commitments to the European Union's energy and climate policies, which have led to a dramatic increase in energy prices. "
If the conflict continues, he would demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It was because of the fact that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, which also contributes to it, added the Polish minister.
His party's approach to the EU is more radical than that of the governing party of Justice and Rights.
According to the European Commission, the changes that took place in Polish justice during Ziobro's tenure endangered its independence and subordinated it to politicians.
Brusel, according to Ziobra, creates " impossible conditions " because its goal is not a legal state, but to change the government in Poland.
Warsaw is facing " political dictatorship " enforced by intimidation and efforts to support the democratic decisions of several million Poles,, according to Ziobro.
He said that Poland should be a member of a European Union based on partnership between sovereign states and not on the rule of the most powerful and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels, which would reduce the sovereignty of Poland.
"I would never accept that Poland would become a colony. "

In his youth, he was punished for his incompetence.
It wasn't because of the badges, mostly it was because she refused to listen to and quarrelled ( instead of listening, she went to bed, quarrelled with her brothers and so on ). .
She has never been punished without warning, her mother threatened that if she did it again, she would get a beating ( sometimes even after a second " beating " with a knife that was only handed to her and placed on the ground so that she could see it.
Only after repeatedly refusing to listen, she was hit on the buttock ( through clothing ). .
Personally, he thinks that physical punishment ( in a reasonable manner and degree ) is beneficial, because the child reacts much more to physical punishment than to words.
The most important part is the part with the warning, because it gives the child a choice whether to ignore it and get nothing,, or to obey it and be rewarded.
In the end, she usually only needed to warn him to start listening.

When the famous Czech politician and Constitutional Court judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 responded to a journalist's question about the meaning of the Czech Constitution, he chose to interpret it as a sacred list of laws on which he was taught in school,, or on the other hand, a treaty that can be changed when necessary.
Once, they agreed on the democratic rules of their life, which at the same time define who they are as a state and its citizens, and with changes are better preserved.
For example, some nations have their own traditions, rituals.
Like the Czechs, the Russians have a fondness for potatoes with pork and wheat, as Vojtěch Cepl commented at the time.
However, in recent years, there has been a growing opinion among legal experts that the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia needs to be changed.
Leta was tested by situations that its creators ( including Vojtěch Cepl ) could not foresee, such as the behavior of the president who was elected directly.
But in one thing, Cepel was right..
All that is known about these documents shows that political interference in their texts must be planned.
The institute must be understood and actively defended, only then it can be the key to surviving most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The Constitution is,, among other things, a set of rules for governing, consisting of individual rules that determine the boundaries of the political game.
They are afraid that the power will be misused against minorities or individuals, so politicians are banned.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.

The course of the disease is usually much easier and lighter, it often takes place without symptoms.
They are young patients who are suffering from the severe form of the corona virus, which is especially noticeable in the last period. Dominik added.

In the present time, there are children of several months and adolescent age in the institution..
However, Má is happy that, in the children's hospital of the FN Brno,, the coronavirus has not caused any child deaths.
According to available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died in Croatia on December 6.
According to Dominika, in the children's hospital - not only on the coronavirus ward - the psychologist is an integral part of the cooperation.
At the same time, he also points out the fact that, similarly to adults, children who are vaccinated reduce the course of the disease and at the same time reduce the occurrence of post--viral syndrome.
" In addition, the application of vaccine doses is also recommended for children. " added the doctor.

The world's events are controlled by the major powers.
Despite the fact that both countries are sovereign states, they are in fact major powers that dictate the course of international affairs.

The example is taken from another commentary " Spanish oranges and mandarines, where it is clear that the oranges and mandarines are from Spain, while in " Spanish oranges and mandarines " the mandarines are not clear whether they are from Spain.
In addition, it is based on the fact that the sentence says "all American forces, including their weapons and that it is known that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, it is assumed that it is included in the broad term and it is not necessary to further specify it among the American forces.
And again,, perhaps just a word or two :D.
If it is so,, if it is not,, it is a nonsensical demand.

I is a big fan of the general overview and the reality is that people do not want and do not need it.
In that moment, it is unnecessary and never does the same to them.
Partially, it is used by a large number of people who need this thing..
As a result, he realized that standing in front of the machines, he didn't need any of them at all, he thought it was completely serious. ... because he did not need any of them at all.
They are slowly entering the era when ignorance is a sign of punk.
The price of this is that in these machines, barbarians will stand, but the price of this is high.

The wedding of the first sight of Kadriho and Andrey continues.
This is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately " responded to the instagram in the stories of the fans who were disappointed by the Kadrim, that she decided to terminate all contact and even blocked it on social media.
The relationship between Kadrim and Andreou was strained from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his plan was that his wife, Andrea, would stay with him until he returned to Croatia permanently.
She, however, resolutely rejected it..
As can be seen, their relationship did not only end in love, rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred..

It's more painful for him when he has to read such inaccurate information, which is probably distorted from the context.
Hrozně bych all wanted to know Kadriho as much as he himself, his close friends and his family stood in admiration in response to the words of Andrey..
I owe her everything.
The people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that he, his family, loved him deeply and knew the truth of what actually happened. she added uncertainly.

He plays the role of a buffoon in order to have a fight with him.
If it is not,, it is sad.
He does not believe that the Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
Once, he also liked many church buildings from an aesthetic point of view ( which was the goal to make them look good ).
I don't care who believes in what.
On the other side, he dislikes the fact that the church had a lot of power in the Middle Ages, that it took a lot of money and suppressed science and other things.
He does not talk about all the wars that caused them,, such as the 30- year war.
I believe in the spaghetti monster,, but the state and the church have nothing to do with each other.

The legendary Nunesová after seven years fell and Oliveiro defended the title.
MMA had a spectacular grand finale filled with interesting results.
At the UFC 269 tournament, things happened.

His opponent also defeated Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one had anticipated.
He brought the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amandou Nunesov and Julianna Penov.
An American entered the duel as an imaginary " dwarf " Nunesová had not lost a match for seven years and was looking for another victory.
The beginning of the duel was also in the spirit of the paper forecasts.
Nunesová started the way to victory very actively and the opponent even made a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, he did not allow himself to be influenced by any other mistakes and himself unsuccessfully attempted to attack with a punch on the arm.
The second round was thrilling and for the fans of MMA, it was very tense.
The two opponents exchanged many impressive shots and hard hooks.
Penova also took Nunesov to the ground, where she began to scratch him.
She had to give up the fight and retreat from the attack..
The American shocked everyone when she became the new champion.
The climax of the evening was the battle for the lightweight title between Charles Oliveirou and Dustin Poirier.

Ten kyčel, or ta kyčel.
At first glance, it is not a complicated task.
The vast majority of basic names in the Romanian language express only one grammatical gender,, so it is not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neutral.
However, there is also a relatively large group of substantive names, where the family name is not established.
These fundamental names oscillate between two genera.
In the process, they acquire double tails and in some cases remain in a non- upright posture.
For example, words such as " swivel " and " kycel " are masculine and feminine and are pronounced in the manner of " machine " and " song " respectively.
The other group of substantives have different forms in the first syllable,, e.g. " row " and " brambor " ( in the sense of food ) .
Both forms are literary and have the same meaning, and are freely interchangeable.
Some words may vary regionally,, for example, " olive " in Croatia and " olive " in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in this case, the Bosnia and Herzegovinian variant is not standardized. Similarly, other Croatian- Bosnia and Herzegovinian duos of words, " Prikape " and " Prikapea " , " cobble " and " cobble " , and " olive " and " olive " are not standardized.
Some words, which have entered the Czech language from other languages, were originally untranslated, and gradually adopted the endings of the Czech language.
A typical example is the word " image " which is both masculine and feminine, and the word " buffet " which has survived in the middle class, but has a masculine ending.

False accusations are rarely made and are very rare.

However, it is still the case that only a small number of people keep it for themselves.

Croatia is flooding the unfinished houses and families do not have money to finish them.
The prices of building materials have increased by more than 30 percent in the last weeks and months.

Construction firms also struggle with a lack of workers.
In Czechia there is a lack of graduates from the construction fields and the influx of foreign workers slows the pandemic.
The situation is more favourable in terms of the issuing of building permits.
"In October, the construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits, this is nearly 10 percent more than the previous year, stated Křeček.

This is the biggest problem of the whole pandemic..
It took a long time for him to adjust to the fact that he had a contagious disease,, but it went smoothly.
The fact that a large part of the population, in all its layers, behaves in an irrational way is a problem that he has struggled with for a long time.
The most enjoyable part of the vaccination ( which will take place the next day ) is that, due to it, he would finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not assholes.
He was ousted from the presidency and was reinstated.
However, the chances of this actually happening are very small..
In addition, he is not sure whether the fact that the archives have been dismantled has made it possible to regard them as a source of great importance.
Velezrada is such an act that the president of the republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or democratic character of the state.
It had to be more serious.
As a result of the pandemic, the number of people between 35 and 40 years old who have no sex throughout the year has increased.
More and more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
The main focus is on the religiously motivated people, reported by the Daily Mail's daily newspaper..
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who stopped having sex increased from 8 to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who stated that they had not had sexual intercourse in the previous year was more than ever.
The decline in the number of sexually active individuals is also influenced by other factors, revealed by a survey of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher percentage of unemployment.
The presence of media, social networks or videogames that make sex less important for young people may also have contributed..
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they had not had sex in the previous year has grown rapidly. " said researcher Lyman Stone of the IFS.
In married couples, sexual activity is more frequent, in 2021, only 5 % of them stated that they had not had sex in the previous year.
Among the free people, it was 29 % and Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also due to fear of premarital sex and religious affiliation.
Despite the fact that men are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married women under the age of 35 is still decreasing.
Young people's view of premarital sex is divided, about 30 % regard it as a bad thing, while about 70 % believe that it is normal.
"The truth is that among the free individuals in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior pushes the trend. " says Stone about the 30 percent of this age group.
The vast majority of those who have moral problems with premarital sex are motivated by religious beliefs.
Since 2008, unmarried people between the ages of 35 and those who attend religious gatherings more than once a month saw the proportion of abstinence increase from 20 percent to nearly 60 percent.
Among the " less believers " the trend rose from 10 to 20 % .
The decline of sexual activity is also influenced by other factors,, such as less social interaction and especially the consumption of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex was lower among people without jobs or with lower incomes.
An additional reason may be the expansion of digital media, which is likely to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time on the internet, as a result of which this need " compensates " for it.
This trend was most pronounced during the lockdown during the period of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole issue of compulsory vaccination against the AIDs is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave in a way that they do not want,, but which may save their lives.
It is a relatively difficult question, one that is of most interest to him personally as a matter of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether, if they are not prohibited and they die, it is their fault.
His argument is that the 80- year old man, who did not know much about the disease, was misinformed and eventually caught it and died.
On the other side, he does not believe that the death of the stubborn opponent of the vaccination, who is on the side of the SPD and the Communist Party, is a result of persecution and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics he mentioned, it is possible to conclude that the vast majority of unvaccinated retirees belong to the second group, and therefore they are able to take care of themselves.
Czechia without snow.
As the mild winter gives way to the dry summer,.
The winter of 2012 in Croatia brought one of the smallest snow accumulations in recent years.
The providers of skiing areas are not able to operate without technical snow, and the weather complicates the preparation of the Jizersky Mountains 500.
It is a trend or an exception.
Lack of snow means that the fight against drought in the Czech Republic will be difficult.
I have one story to tell, but it is not about a man and a woman.
Once in the middle of the city, the teacher led them through the entire city on boats, allowing them to sail on the river.
Along the way, they passed through a fairly wide street, in the middle of which they saw a group of followers of the Hare Krišna sect.
It was inevitable that they fell on them.
However, he managed to escape, and with one of his friends, they went into a conversation.
When they left, they asked her as well as the teacher.
They asked him whether he wanted to save his soul.
He said to them that he has no soul, that he replied.
All of them, including the teachers, were smashed all the way to the shipyard..
They are horribly disoriented.
There are not so many deaths, but the system is collapsing, Orozović says.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, landed in Warsaw, where he was greeted by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors.
" Opening a new chapter in their relationship " said Morawiecki at the joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe would not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The crisis caused by the disorderly movements of the Russian army on the border of Ukraine is, according to the Chancellor, to be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, within the framework of the " Normandy Group " consisting of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that the Chancellor informed him of the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko deliberately created a migrant crisis by using people as living targets and weapons, because every night there are hundreds of attempts to cross the border illegally.
With the Chancellor, he discussed further sanctions to force the Lukašenko regime and its supporters in the Kremlin to realize that they are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to DPA,, Scholz confirmed that Warsaw was enjoying German support in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the brutal treatment of refugees by the regime of Lukashenko.
The Polish nun who caused the accident tried to conceal it.
The car returned to the site of the accident,, but it was driven by a different pilot,, who tried to take the blame on himself.
When the police told her that she would lose her driver's licence if she was not given priority in traffic and was removed from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, stated TVN24 station.
She admitted that the aircraft collided with another nun, who asked her for help.
The police then came for Celestine's sister.
They subjected her to breathing tests and after discovering that her blood contained more than two parts per million, they immediately stripped her of her driving licence.
At the same time, she announced that she would speak about her actions in court.
Pes Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmoviic did not hide his film.
The Czech creators of family comedies have been seen in American stories about psychological pets.
However, they neglected the most important thing of filmmaking,, the laws of the film industry.
After the kitchy film F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people to live, another film with a focus on the audience's emotions was screened in cinemas..
Co-- writer and director of the film, Juraj Šajmovič Jr. freely continues on from his previous film Tady Hlidam I in 2012.
The scene reappears with speaking jackal Hugo and some well--known characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the pension in the Carpathian Mountains, which is about to close down, and so they begin to recruit a group of peasants to take care of it. Julie's father with his partner and mainly his daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl but a young woman who is experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner, Beatriz Šajmovičov, ( who is also the producer of the film ) struggled with the pace of the narrative in the previous dog film, which appealed to both children and dogs.
For the second time, the creative duo wrote a weak script that provokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of despair.
To shrink it down.
Julie, a scientist, is under the spell of the desire to have a child, she has sex with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the constellation of the stars is right - on the roofs of cars or church towers ( inevitably during an excursion with a local guide, the retired colonel Mojmír, despite his long--standing training in the forest, is killed in the forest and his daughter ( Julie ) falls into a coma, after which she is removed from the hospital to be reunited with her family in the mountains of Sylvania.
There is no opposition to the conservation of nature and the love of wild animals.
Their owners know why they have them.
The spectator, however, saw that the content of the film was full of unbelievable situations and figures.
The duo of thieves from the personnel and the competition of hunters, the shumavian sharlatan and the policemen arriving at the scene to find " drugs " and discussing about the medicinal properties of bone powder - and the family of the pension,, in fact, intoxicated.
When the hero comes out of a coma, she sits on a bed with a cigar in her mouth and demands her father's whisky and cigars as she has become a vegetarian. It is impossible to resist..
The filmmakers explain to the audience that " sometimes after a coma, it becomes. "
Šajmović's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to create central situations, an understanding of character and a sense of direction.
The acting is unbalanced, the cuts are sloppy and the overall impression is sloppy.
Whatever Lukas Vaculik, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to survive, they have little to play.
The only surviving feature of the film is the poetic images of the Šumavian landscape shot by cameraman Vladimir Holomka and the duo of eagles.
It is not possible to depict a few characters with a few plot twists and vulgar phrases used by the characters..
The argument is not the fact that they are long--standing members of the Club of Hedgehog Breeders - as in the case of the producers.
For the purpose of propagating nature and friendship between man and horse, it is also necessary to have knowledge of the craft. in order to tell a believable story.
In this case, it failed.
For a good family film, there is too much erotica and too little sentiment for the genre.
But even as a promotion for canisterapy, this amateurish piece of film did not pass.
However, respect, because they have to listen to continuous insults from the same kind of people as themselves.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, which is shown by the fact that this piece of rubbish understands it,, but only because he has never tried it.
The decision is always in the hands of the customer,, if he does not want to, the answer is always no.
If he had listened to the music for a long time, he may have changed his opinion.
It is the same kind of work as any other, in some cases brigade work.

Around 3 years ago, this also happened to him..
She was a little overbearing and grilled him during the conversation, in order to find out what she wanted from him.
In the end, he discovered that his suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because he really dislikes them, he was harassed by doubts and questions for a while, and then he finally withdrew and left..
He calmly says that he is a grazler, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.

The biggest surge is expected in the period of skiing camps.
Together with the chairman of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear David Šintak, he feels that there is not as much interest in renting skiing equipment as before.

From abroad, the strong and skilful people leave, who have no property there.
The owner of the company only goes abroad for a short time.
However, the rest of it is completely in agreement.

Emigration from Romania began with one beautiful day when Orbán won the election and ruled for a year, and then the annual emigration increased by a few thousand.
It is naive to think that, from one day to the next, the Czech Republic could find itself in a similar position.
The next issue is the election.
When he is living there, it is possible that a traditional V4kovian madman can win.
The young and the educated leave, the supporters and those whose property is used to prop up the aircraft remain..
A terrifying photo.

While in Croatia, the film was in full production, the crew of the film starring Jiří Langmajer (55) used tropical weather in Thailand.

Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG ( approximately 5 divisions ) .
I, too, do not underestimate Ukraine..
They are not " an overwhelming number " but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
It is noted that Ukraine constantly repeats that the threat of invasion is exaggerated and begins to have a negative attitude towards its entry.
He was at the top of the mountain.
He does not know how he came to the conclusion that Russia wants to wage war.
The war is very expensive and Russia has the HDP of Italy.
Compared to the situation in 1938, it is in so many ways that it is not known where to start.
He can compare the First Punic War and the " annexation " of Sicily.
It was hard to imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not adhere to the Minsk agreement, Russia annexed the small republics.
This is the same and the " concentration " on the borders corresponded to it.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda.

A healthy lunch or breakfast in the office from a supermarket.
Ahoy, he works a 9 to 5 shift with a 30 minute break and the only place where he can get food is by going to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Due to the lack of movement and the lack of strength after work, he has to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, he never knows what he is going to eat, and he eats as fast as he can, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat, eating as much as he can eat.

Not all of them wait for a meter of snow as they do,.
It is not the trees that must be seen.
Under the snow, only the tip of a tree can be hidden.

Confession of the Dary of the Relationship with Nedvědem. I was not happy about it.
The Croatian version of the reality show " The Bachelor " has been on hiatus since the revelation of the relationship between Dary Rolins and Pavla Nedvěda.
They have been together since the summer,, the famous football player even broke up with her because of the singer.
Dara sent a lengthy message to her fans in which she explained that she had been in love with him for half a year before revealing it to the public.
"Dara,, who is the most successful Czech football player, is in love up to her ears with the bear, Dara. " jokes Dara Rolins, who is the most successful Czech football player.
But he took her away from him, not the other way around.
Three days are the focus of attention, and although they are popular with the public, they are not a source of joy.
It's here now.
Both of them did not like it, but they knew that one day it would happen, and the singer continued.
I don't know who is worse off.
Whatever those who don't care for it and are eaten by them, from cans,, or those who have their lives depicted in detail..
As if someone wanted to know his opinion on whether he fits with his husband or his girlfriend, or that he was determined to reveal the list of his former lovers and that he was aware of the list of his mistakes and failures.
This is the way of the warrior, what he wants to do, it is the way of Daere.
The duo came together in Italy, where Rolins was preparing her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been vice president of football club Juventus for a long time..
The truth was revealed only now, because they waited for the end of Nedvěd's divorce.
His wife, Ivana, has been separated from him for three years, they are not legally married but they have been together for three weeks..
In fact, those who rejoice with them and wish for them are to be thanked.
I are just people, they have families, children and pasts and dreams.
They are not perfect, but they both have their hearts in the right place.
In his new love, he loves him as much as he loves him, and he stands with him in good times and bad times. Rolins concluded..
Ahoy, the other commentators have already said most of the important things, only confirming that the beginning of the first semester or two is when most of the students fall in love and become roommates, which is the best option because they know who they are living with.
Most apartments are not advertised for a long period of time, so there are not many of them now, but it is not harmful to look at the offer..
Certainly, they are avoided not only Cejlu, but also the surrounding areas ( streets such as Vranovska and Francouzska) and some parts of Židenic are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the fourth quarter of Veveří is heavily student, Kralovo Pole and in that direction is good,, except that it is close to most of the faculties of VUT ( he does not know exactly where he starts.
He has never been a tenant,, but he is a native of Brno,, so he can possibly help with Brno as he has some information missing..
But this is a completely " normal " way of thinking.
For this reason, because the decision was made by a number of doctors in Poland, it is in fact completely in order that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
either to study what they want and pay for it themselves or to follow the state's rules and pay for it from the state.
It is not possible to allow a private actor to dominate a part of the school system only because it receives a small amount of state funding and because it is able to teach what it wants in the schools..
This statement loses some of its weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier described a protest against a totalitarian state in the same way.
In other words, his opposition to abortion is the same as his opposition to a statue standing on the square.
By the end of the day, he had met with the person who had assigned him the job.
During the catalogization and digitalization, he had already witnessed that ( and also long--term professionals ) that it was written in a sloppy manner or that it was written in a way that was not easy to read or that it was written in a way that was not easy to read ( according to convention ) and that it was written in a way that was not easy to read ( according to convention ) and that it was written in a way that was not easy to read ( according to convention ) and that it was written in a way that was not easy to read ( according to convention ) and that it was written in a way that was not easy to read ( according to convention ) and that it was written in a way that was not easy to read ( according to convention ) and that it was written in a way that was not easy to read ( according to convention ) and that it was written in a way that was not easy to read ( according to convention ) and that it was written in a way that was not easy to read ( according to convention ) and that it was written in a way that was not easy to read ( according to convention ) and that it was written in a way that was not easy to read ( according to convention
The fact is that in this case, it is quite recognizable, so that it is almost completely discouraged.
Personally, he would have handled it in a note according to the program he used.
If he wanted to be a good and diligent student, he could look at some of the phylogenetic databases and find the closest.
However, because it looks like it was copied from a book, it is likely that the author or printer simply created his own personal sign, which fits with what is physically on the coin.
It is not a coincidence, rather the Odryan Empire ( kingdom ) rather than the Odryan Kingdom.
It is said that someone has already destroyed it there..
He looked at the comment of Φīlh.
The politicians do not know what will be the theme of Romania's presidency.
This is much worse than the fact that they will have translators with them.
The idea that it was approved because no one understood the text is amusing.
All important approved documents are scrutinized word by word, and a basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter of law.
In various institutions of the European Union, hundreds of translators and interpreters work, English is preferred by politicians for informal relations and the establishment of special relationships.
In addition, with the English, it is quite interesting after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
I don't understand the hatred on Cejl.
They have been working there for the third year and are in good shape.

To say that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly lived in the ghetto.
Jo lives in the area where most of the Roma population lives in the city of Brno,, but the only thing they do there is that they block the pavement and park where they are not allowed to. The only thing they do there is that they block the pavement and park where they are not allowed to.
However, if they are looking for relatively low- cost housing with good access to the center, they could go there.
A lot of houses have been newly reconstructed or newly built there..
Felix Slováček ( 78 years old, without Dadies and girlfriends, as a coil in the plot )
As long as Christmas lasts.
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
He did not have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to burn.
Blesku's saxophonist said that he had seen Dada's veil and that Lucie was wearing one as well. He confirmed the words of Patrasov, who said that she often visits him.
She visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrade, where Dada stayed alone after his departure.

He made it clear.
As an island, they could allow themselves to be without soldiers and weapons.
I don't believe that they would be attacked by anyone and that their location is so strategically important that an aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot to not occupy this territory.
I don't understand why it is a bad argument, he explained it to him.
There is no other substance that could be used as a replacement in the hospitals..
Police officers are few and they cannot afford it, so the firefighters and nowhere else have such a high percentage of well- trained people on such a high level.
That the army is capable of defending Ostrava goes to the head of the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.

Croatia is experiencing the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, rainfall has decreased in mountainous and mountainous areas, rainfall has also decreased in areas where rainfall was previously scarce.
The cause of the drought that prevails in a large part of central Europe is climatic change.
However, the effects are amplified by the manner in which the land is cultivated.
In relation to the drought, preparations have been made.
And how nature can help in difficult times.
I will be playing in the ice hockey team for a while, he knows how to play the game and the tactics ( which he tried in the game of Franchise Hockey Manager ) are also total nonsense.
A team of bears from Russia or lambs from China would lose by two goals even if they did not have to win the match..
However, as is the case with the commentators and referees who comment on the men's or women's football, it is all strange, but this is the case with all sports, UEFA and " Italian footballers " or motorsport F1, WRC, atd.
Controversy is everywhere.
If it was the other way around, it would have been as in the past, that they lost more often than they won, and that it was a typical "Voni lost " vs " My team won ".

Chief of the British Labour Party Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson probably violated the law by organizing a New Year's party in Downing Street in December 2009, when the lockdown and the prohibition of New Year 's parties were established.
One of Johnson's ministers defended that the quiz was held " virtually " over a computer.
However, members of the Downing Street staff gathered around the computers..
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the position of prime minister is increasing.
During the lockdown in London in December 2010, when the strict lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties in defiance of the lockdown.
The British public and the media are outraged that the Johnson and his government made fun of them.
Paul Brand, editor of the commercial television channel ITV in Britain, defeated Boris Johnson decisively in the general elections two years ago.
In the morning, the Conservative Party said that it was necessary to remove him from the position of Prime Minister.
It is noteworthy that the events developed rapidly.
They want to turn around and save their skin.
Romania is waiting for elections in the spring, which could end the 12- year reign of Victor Orban.
The elections are of great importance for the whole of Europe.
It's hard to believe that they will be fair.
They will not be fair.
They are unlikely to be free, because the last two elections under Orbán were not free.
His party, Fides, controls the media, changes the boundaries of election districts in order to profit, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
The current situation is such that each person can freely choose where they want to live..
This allows Fideshu to attract voters from certain districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could win.
However, he repeats that there will be no ferries at all.
They think that it would be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018.
The situation is very different.
Previously, the focus was on whether Fidesz would win, how much, and whether it would have a parliamentary majority.
There is now a real possibility that the united opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
For Victor Orbán and his party, this is an unprecedented phenomenon.
They will not want to maintain power by playing more aggressively.
There are some signs that they are prepared to go beyond what they had done before.
Lately, a recording of the president of the Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidescu, Lászloa Kövera, was released, in which the chiefs of the secret services declare that the opposition is a threat to national security.
These are the indications of a new approach, which are mentioned.
This is one of the new things.
All begins with language.
She was beaten quite often, the last time was when she was 14 years old, her mother has little patience and her mother-in- law has been beating her for a long time, but then she broke down violently ( only in relation to her husband ). .
At the same time, she was very aggressive and angry, to the extent that she lay on the ground in a cage and was completely blue, twice she was put under the sprinkler to calm down.
Occasionally he was reprimanded, sometimes because he did not know what he was doing.

She is unable to determine to what extent her explosiveness is due to her upbringing, but it is clear that her upbringing has also played a part.
He is afraid that he will also lose his patience with his children and resolve it in the same way.
He thinks that beating children is bad and that his parents did not do it, especially at this time when it was not " educational " but because of frustration. On the other hand, it is possible that every parent damages his children slightly. so he does not blame them.
Mě is not affected by it and does not understand why he should be punished.
The laws are clear and unambiguous.
I would call those who create the laws in such a high quality.
I would have liked to know whether they are afraid of a drop in income.
It is possible to count on the fact that people want and buy these products and that they will be able to pay off the debt of the property.
Kocner's bizarre world.
When Slovakia moves the process of the murder of the journalist Kuciaka.
In Slovenia, the main trial in the case of the four accused of the murder of Jana Kuciaka and Martina Kusnirov began.
The death of an investigative journalist and his partner changed Slovakia.
The civil society movement was strengthened, but also revealed the practices of accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connection to the top of Romanian politics and justice.
The most important break for Slovenia would be the process.
For this, the journalists can be enormous.
It is possible that this petition received more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which was issued a day or two later.
They have been neglected and left to their own devices, and society has disintegrated as a result.

The next government ends and the law on the involvement of villages in the waste disposal site is nowhere.
The minister's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked.
The government of Prime Minister Andreje Babiše is ending and the law that was meant to ensure respect for the interests of villages and their citizens in the selection and approval of deep underground radioactive waste disposal sites still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of the proposal presented by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
However, its content is in serious disagreement not only with the cities and towns united in the Platform against underground nuclear waste storage and with the Association of Cities and Towns of Romania.
The local authorities, according to the law of 2011,, when the first works on this legislation began and which demands a Czech atomic law and a European directive,, are expected to have more power in deciding on the disposal sites from 2011, when the first works on this legislation began and which demands a Czech atomic law and a European directive.
It is expected that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
Minister Karla Havlíčka's proposal, which the Platform has in its possession, is criticized by the cities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of the cities and the public in the process of deciding on the location of the repository is inadequate and cannot guarantee respect for the interests of the cities and their citizens.
In reality, it can be effective only when the city or the public can influence whether the process continues in that locality.
It is possible to ensure the placement of the obligations of the custodians by requesting the consent of the affected communities before the commencement of the specific operation..
The proposed plan almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the villages mere statistics in the decision-making process.
The proposal lacks a system of compensation for the villages for the entire process of searching for and selecting locations for the disposal site, its approval and operation.
The representatives of the villages, according to today's legal norms, have little possibilities to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for places for the landfills.
Only in some permitting authorities, they can submit their objections or appeal,, but the decision is made by the authority or the minister in whose interest the permit is issued..
The possibility of a lawsuit does not have an immediate effect on the execution of surveying or construction work.
The Platform's proposal for a joint decision by the municipalities is a common practice in many democratically developed countries and decisively in those where the use of landfills has progressed,, such as Sweden and Finland.
The preparation of the law is outside of the failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the Havel and Partners Advocacy Company, which was signed by SÚrao and followed by contracts with the advocate Janen Zemanek.
The total sum of these works, according to the contract, is approximately 4 million koruna.
Antonin Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hráde area and spokesperson of the Platform against underground nuclear waste storage said that after the ministers of the Ministry of Industry and Agriculture, who only abolished the role of local authorities in the search for underground nuclear waste storage,, there was a significant turnaround from the new government.
They also offer assistance.
They also praised the support of the Association of cities and towns,, which also considers the lack of rights of towns and villages in the affected areas to be similar to that of directly affected towns and villages in the selected areas.
The Platform against underground nuclear waste disposal is composed of 51 members ( 35 towns and cities and 16 associations ) for the purpose of promoting changes in the state's approach to the disposal of nuclear waste and other radioactive waste that are not limited to underground nuclear waste disposal.
The Platform also proposes that the decision on the location of the disposal site was dependent on the prior approval of the affected towns.
Herce John Goodman (69 years old, lost 90 pounds )

It depends on which boss and how the word " boss " is used.
When it comes to a text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, it is not necessary to translate it.
If it was a formal text or a high school text,, he would have looked for the way in which the bosses more often described or explained.
In all cases, there are more than one type of boss.
Maybe the game has several bosses, that is " boss " like a king or ruler of a certain level, and then there is a final boss.
In many games there are hidden bosses ( super bosses ) who are not necessary to defeat to complete the game or level, but are often stronger than standard bosses.
Theses include games such as Half- Life, where the bosses are present, but the player does not fight them directly ( Tentacle and Gargantua ). and they can be referred to as bosses.
And then there are mini bosses.
Ono is able to translate one word at a time, in a way that none of the other languages are able to do. For example, Catalan, which translates the boss as the final antagonist.
It's for the story or the game generally important, a computer- controlled opponent stronger than all previous and guarding the completion of a certain level or task.
