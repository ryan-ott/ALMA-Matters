Scream at the world
The "Looks Like You Need Iceland" campaign has got off to a great start and the calls to action in the wild are being heard all over the world.
"You have the collective case of FOMO [fear of missing out], I need Iceland," one woman, commenting on an advert for the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign on YouTube, said.
One spectator vows to keep Iceland in her heart forever, and a young woman says she has to come to Iceland as soon as possible because her boyfriend lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States right now, so she is expecting to be there for at least a few more months.
One spectator asks if the path to Iceland is open, as there are no aircraft.
It is not known whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson from Peel, who worked on the campaign alongside M&C Saatchi, said that the response has been overwhelmingly positive.
"I have been involved in many Inspired by Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already breaking records.
Basically, it's about creating publicity, getting foreign media to report on the campaign, and it's been a huge success.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in over seven hundred media outlets world-wide, reaching the attention of well over two billion people.
The value of this coverage is estimated at ISK 18 billion.
It's not a bad thing."
The primary market has traditionally been the United States, and the campaign has done very well there, even though the United States is not a likely destination for the foreseeable future.
According to Egill, known markets such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also taken it well, as has Russia, which comes as a pleasant surprise.
There was backlash from the global community, especially from India, which had not been made a priority.
"These ads have traveled further than we expected," Egill said, noting that over four million people have watched the videos on YouTube.
"We couldn't have asked for a better start."
These photos were taken by Árni Sæberg, a photographer for Morgunblaðið, during a shoot for an advertising campaign called "Let It Out" in mid-last month.
The shootings took place in a wide variety of locations, including Skólavörðustíg in Reykjavík, Reynisfjöru, Skógafoss, Sólheimajökull and a cave near Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions, and the camera operator was Óttar Guðnason.
In the roles mentioned above, the Icelandic actors were Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who come from Cuba and Hungary.
Hundreds of Icelanders worked on the creation of the advertisements, but at the same time as the recordings took place in the south of the country, another group was working in the west and the west fjords.
According to Egill, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the "Looks Like You Need Iceland" campaign, with a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi planned.
"This is just the first phase in this work for Íslandsstofa," says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone extremely well.
"It's great to work with them.
In these types of projects, it's really important to have a local partner who understands the markets we are looking to operate in."
Sprengisandur: A discussion about the situation in the labour market, pension funds and many other things
Island's Minister for Social Affairs and Children, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, will be on Sprengisand today at 10:00 on Bylgjunni.
He is also the Minister for Labour and he talks about the situation in the labour market, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also covers regional issues and the repatriation of jobs from the country, which has been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the president of VR, will also be in the show, where he will discuss his criticism of the investments of the pension funds, and he will put forward the idea that the labour movement and employers should withdraw from the boards of the pension funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
We will talk to Ivar Ingimarsson, a tourism professional in Austurland, and Arnheiður Jóhannsdóttir, Director of the Markaðsstofu Norðurlands, about the situation in rural tourism.
They'll look ahead to the autumn, wondering whether the summer's success is a mirage of what's to come.
You can listen live below, from 10:00.
This is how it looked 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donna had a successful career in teen dramas.
However, she became a household name with her performance as Amber in the 1995 film "Clueless."
She also starred on the show Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in 90210.
Donovan is 49 years old, married with one child.
She's been pretty scarce recently, but she popped up to look back on her past and comment on Clueless on an Australian TV show last week.
She speaks lovingly of Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, saying that she was an amazing person.
"I have to say that I based the character on girls I knew who were mean to me when I was in school.
While reading the script, I knew who this person was as soon as I read it," Donovan said of his Clueless character.
He did not want to leave the police station after spending the night there
Around fifty cases were brought to the attention of the Metropolitan Police today, and in the Metropolitan Police's daily log it says that the cases were wide-ranging.
The day at Hverfisgata Police Station started with the police having to deal with a man who had recently been released from prison after serving a sentence for drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after being released, and did not follow the instructions of the police, who ordered him to leave.
Did the man get to stay in the police station because of his behaviour?
In the morning a man was arrested for suspected break-in to a business in Kópavogur.
The police also had to deal with two men in Breiðholt in connection with a report of a physical altercation.
In addition, a woman who was having lunch in a shopping centre in Kópavogur was unable to pay her bill at the end of the meal and was subsequently called to the police.
A car was also stolen in the central business district this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van was looking for her for a short time and she was then snatched.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Happy Pirates - The Ghastly Fate of the Glee Pirates
The theory has gone viral on the Internet that the curse has befallen the Glee series, as actress Naya Rivera drowned in California just days ago, making her the third lead cast member to die prematurely.
The Glee TV series is a popular show with singing, dancing, and high school drama.
It was about a group of teenagers in high school, their loves and their fate.
It wasn't always easy being in the Happy Family, but through song and dance, the characters in the show seemed to overcome whatever life threw at them.
Aside from the set, many tragedies have befallen the cast and crew, to the point where there is speculation that the show may be cursed.
Naya Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez, a high school cheerleader who wasn't quite ready for adulthood.
After the show ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and they had a son, Josey.
In 2017 Rivera was arrested for domestic assault against her partner, and they subsequently split.
However, Dorsey refused to press charges, and the domestic incident was closed.
On July 8, it was reported that Riveru was missing after her 4-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a lifejacket on board the boat, and was able to tell authorities that he and his mother had gone swimming, and that Rivera had returned to pick him up, but never came back.
An all-out search for Rivera was underway.
The day after the search began, area law enforcement officials stated that they believed Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and declared dead.
She is believed to have been swept away in the strong current and used her last breath to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded as alcohol intoxication.
Cory Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson on the show, the American football star with the angelic voice who was instrumental in propelling the band to fame.
Outside of the show, Moneith has struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13 he had struggled with addiction and it proved difficult to overcome.
In 2013, his colleagues on the show staged an intervention and urged him to get help.
Moneith went into treatment and appeared to be doing well.
Just two months after completing treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out with friends.
The cause of death was ruled an overdose, a lethal mix of drugs and alcohol.
They ruled out foul play.
Moneith had been hospitalized and his tolerance to drugs had been reduced to the point that a dose he had previously tolerated fatally.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death had a significant impact on his colleagues, but after the urging of his co-star, Lea Michele, it was announced that the show would continue, dedicating an entire episode to honoring Moneith and his character, Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played Noah "Puck" Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow New Direction members, until he gained the courage to admit he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of possessing child pornography.
During a search at his home large amounts of child pornography were found and the case soon became public.
It was clear that Salling was done for the day.
He was subsequently charged and convicted.
This would carry a prison sentence of four to seven years, and would mean he would have to register as a sex offender and seek treatment for paedophilic tendencies.
Prior to the sentencing, Salling, who was then on home confinement, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors in the show who were long gone.
Jim Fuller was the show's co-executive producer.
He died in his sleep at the age of 41 in 2013.
The show also featured a woman called Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the famous actress, Julia Roberts, and she did not have a good story to tell about her sister, as she accused Roberts of being bossy and rude.
Motes died by suicide in 2014, but she had struggled with severe depression.
She left a note for her fiancé, blaming her mother and sister for what had happened to her.
"My mother and so-called siblings will get nothing from me, except the memory of how they caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and harassing her co-stars on the set, and of being a diva.
Jesse Luken also guest starred on the show in 2012.
He was arrested for drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a huge scandal.
The actress, Heather Morris, had a large role in the show.
In 2010 she was the victim of a theft of her nude photos, which were published on the Internet by fraudsters.
The actors, Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner, both acted on the show and dated in real life.
Benoist later claimed that Jenner had abused her during their relationship.
You can literally put flowers on anything
It provides developmental enrichment for children if they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents and to help tend the flowers and watch them grow.
This can also be done endlessly with flowers, as pointed out by the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel.
Spending time in the garden with the children is something that will always be special to me.
They will remember the flowers, the scent, and of course the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat after the tenth grade
"I do not think there are many seamen who work in kindergartens," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who fishes during the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter."
Boating is a great summer job if you're at school.
It's a good way to make money if you're good, and it's great not to have to pay back student loans.
The income is enough to see me through the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who has fished from the beach for the past few summers.
Axel was just docking his boat in Tálknafirði when this reporter caught up with him late in the week."
"In my final year of high school I got my boating license for boats under twelve meters, and in the summer after I finished high school I bought my boat.
I've fished for scallops from my boat every summer since I was a kid.
I bought the boat from a friend, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after him.
Hartmann was well into adulthood when I bought the boat, and was no longer in the habit of going to sea, so he was very pleased to see that the boat had his name on it.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million Swedish crowns.
"I made a deal with Hartmann that I would pay him half of it, i.e. ISK 1.5 million, at the start of summer, and the other half at the end of summer when I had paid all my bills.
I ended up owning the boat debt-free at the end of my first summer in it."
How did a boy who had just finished primary school have 1.5 million to pay the ferryman?
"I had put money aside, I had worked with my dad at sea when I was younger, I spent all my summers with him fishing and I got my share.
I also put my confirmation money in my boat fund."
Axel was born in Isafjordur, where all his ancestors are from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a kid.
"I'm allowed to fish here in the Westfjords area because I'm registered to live with my grandmother in Isafjordur.
I learned about these areas in the west from my dad, a rower.
I move around the fjords according to how I feel, because this fishing area covers all of Westfjords.
While I prefer being on the west coast, I've also fished around Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
I also fish in the south, mainly for herring," says Axel, who always starts fishing early in the morning and sometimes talks to the gulls and sings to the sky in solitude out on the sea.
"The internet connection is good, so I can make phone calls, listen to podcasts and music.
I don't mind being alone at sea.
Of course I try to avoid getting into trouble, but there have been times when the weather has been bad, but never any real danger," says Axel, who is lucky in that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the workday varies depending on how things are going fishing-wise.
"In the humpback whale fishery, I'm never more than 14 days at a time, but I've also been fishing in other systems, like the quota share, where I've been out for up to 72 hours at a time fishing."
He says the quota system for inshore fishing allows him to catch 770kg a day, which he says is unsustainable.
"Other restrictions are that I cannot fish on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and that I can only fish twelve days in a month, four months out of the year, from May through August, when the inshore fishing is open.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days according to the weather, and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure on sailors to go out instead of having 48 days off throughout the summer and being able to choose when they go out.

Axel works during the winter in Iceland with his studies at Núpi pre-school in Kópavogur.
"I don't think there are many sailors who work in pre-schools," says Axel proudly, adding that he had only intended to work in a pre-school on a temporary basis.
"I get stuck because I love the job.
I hope that the psychology studies will be of use to me in the future in the kindergarten," says Axel, who is also far along in his studies in business.
Villa in registration foils Covid-19 transmission at home
The use of the term "island" in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in Iceland has meant that an individual, resident in Iceland, has not been called back for testing.
It is not required to register a Social Security number if the form is filled out in English, as it is when it is filled out in Icelandic.
"This will be reviewed this week," said a spokesperson for the Health Protection Agency.
Three domestic cases were reported in the Infectious Disease Division of Landspítalinn yesterday.
One of the individuals tested was positive, arriving in the country on July 15, two days after the commencement of the so-called home quarantine rule.
They are screened on arrival in Iceland as well as being called back for testing four or five days later.
In the afternoon news on RÚV, it was reported that the person in question had gone back to the old system.
The sample taken at the border was negative, and he was not called back for further virus screening.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, specialist in infectious diseases at the Landlæknisembætti, told Fréttablaðið that this was due to an error in the electronic registration form.
While filling out the registration form in English, it is not a requirement to put in your ID number, as it is in the Icelandic version.
In fact, it was primarily designed for foreign tourists.
This means that the individual has not received an automatic invitation to come in for testing.
Kamilla says that many people have continued to follow the quarantine rules, despite filling in the form in English, and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people back for testing after they arrive in the country.
"This will be looked at in the coming weeks to see if we can make it easier for people to access this and draw attention to the process."
The man is in isolation and six people have been quarantined.
They are all being tested, but two have shown symptoms.
Contact tracing is ongoing for the three cases reported yesterday, but is largely complete for the two cases reported on Friday.
In both cases, the genetic sequencing of the Icelandic Biomedical Authority has shown that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not previously been found here.
In the second case, the bands were directed at Israel, although it was known that the person who had brought the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be revealed tomorrow where the second virus is originating from.
Alls eru nú 15 í einangrun samkvæmt vefnum COVID.is.
135 people are in quarantine.
Four of five cases are not related
Five domestic cases have been reported in Iceland in the past few days.
Of the four, only one is completely unrelated, and in fact, the source of the outbreak at yesterday's Rey Cup has not yet been identified.
The tracing of infections is still ongoing.
Thirty-one specialist ambulances were originally sent to enforce quarantine measures, but this was reduced to sixteen.
In total, 34 people are in quarantine because of these new cases that were reported yesterday.
This is the second time in quick succession that an infection has been reported at a sporting event, raising questions about whether such mass gatherings should go ahead.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, a spokesman for the National Police and Fire Academy, said that it is manageable as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
"We continue to stress to everyone who lives here the importance of personal hygiene.
We also need to stress to people who are putting on events that there are rules and regulations that need to be followed.
We can have an event," says Jóhann.
He says that the best way to avoid infection is to maintain individual hygiene practices.
Rules and guidelines, however, remain in a constant state of review.
"What we need to do, and what the Health Protection Agency and the Department of Health are constantly stressing, is the importance of individual public health measures.
Both at home and with service providers.
That people wash their hands and use disinfectant spray.
It prevents the spread," Johann says.
"We need to reiterate to people that we're still on that good path that we were on before, to be able to maintain that success that we've had so far."
40% of COVID-19 cases had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield overheard her father struggling to breathe on the phone.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was executed.
The deaths were attributed to acute respiratory failure due to a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was noted on the death certificate as the underlying cause, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, was petrified it would be the same for her.
Reuters news agency says that Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
The figures from the new study, which was commissioned by the US government, show that around 40% of those who died had Type 2 diabetes as an underlying cause.
As the proportion of people who haven't reached the age of 65 increases, the proportion increases to one half.
The study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) involved more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an expert on infectious diseases at the CDC, called the findings "striking," especially for individuals who have Type 2 diabetes and their family members.
Was concealed in slow growth. Reuters conducted a survey and the answers from the 12 countries that responded corresponded to similar ratios.
10 states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, are not yet reporting the underlying causes of death.
"Diabetes was already an epidemic in slow motion.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a strong tide," Reuters quoted Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among black and Hispanic people, who have also had a higher rate of serious illness from COVID-19.
The best defense for those with Type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease under control through exercise, a healthy diet, and working with the medical professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted many people's routines.
The high cost of insulin has pushed some people to continue to go to work, thus reducing their chances of being exposed to the virus.
Reuters reports that U.S. authorities must have been aware of the threat to people with diabetes 2 from the virus.
During the 2003 SARS outbreak, over 20% of cases became ill; during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, this group was three times as likely to be hospitalized.
In 2012, one study found that up to 60% of those who died or were hospitalized with MERS had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist from Yale University, said that the impact of COVID-19 virus may last longer, so the epidemic may expose a large number of previously unknown complications.
"I'm worried that we're going to see a tsunami of problems once this is over," said Andrew Bolton, president of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a surge in complications from diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney failure.
This new research suggests that COVID-19 may be driving an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the link between coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, liver and kidney, organs that are already vulnerable to infection in people with diabetes.
In fact, high concentrations of both glucose and lipids in the blood of diabetic patients can trigger a full-blown "immune storm," as it's called, when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause a fatal blood clot.
"It's a big puzzle," said Dela Cruz.
"It all feeds into each other."
This has been corrected.
"They were offered champagne, so they left the room."
The couple, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason, accepted the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a piece he was working on in Paris.
"We loved each other, so it wasn't hard."
Atli Bollason never forgets the first time he met his wife, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, and his stepson.
"I fell in love with it.
It was just the glow, but I also thought it was adorable.
And he still thinks so," he says.
Asrún remembers this too, since her husband regularly brings up their first meeting.
"I always hear that story.
Last weekend, in fact," she says, adding that she was also attracted to her husband on first meeting.
"I thought and still do, that there was a lot of hype around Atli, which I enjoy.
There's a lot going on, a lot of things happening, and I fell in love with it."
Atli says the couple have made it a priority to follow their own paths.
"We do not tie up our bags in the same way as other travellers.
We shy away from routines that we perceive around us."
This may be why they greeted the removal of Ragnar Kjartansson's artwork with such enthusiasm, even if it was far from conventional.
"Kristín Anna, our mutual friend, gets in touch to ask if we'd like to join her, Ragga and Ingibjörg, wife of Ragnar, for dessert at Snaps."
They accepted the invite, met the three amigos at Snaps and had some dessert wine and their share of the dessert.
They listened to Ragnar as he led them through his plans for an art exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris this autumn.
"He was making a series of videos called Scenes from Western Culture.
He was very succinct."
Asgerdur says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and he was just asking us if we were interested in being a part of it."
Senan, who was asked by Ragnar to cast the couple, was meant to show a young couple falling in love in a minimalist apartment.
"This is intercourse with a beginning and an end," says Atli.
The pair did not really know Ragnar, although they had heard of him and he had heard of them, "but they knew us and thought we would fit the bill.
They said they didn't want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they would not get the right people but people who get sexual gratification out of performing for others."
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"We were walking out of Snaps and we said, 'Isn't this amazing?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his whole team," says Ásrún, and Atli agrees.
"It's about love and intimacy."
Senan was picked up in a posh apartment in Myrargata.
It was a very small film crew; the director, Ragnar, the camera man, and the sound man, and the couple.
After the recording started, everyone left the room except Atli and Ásrún.
"We weren't really sure how we were going to do it.
We got some instructions, but we tried to forget about time and place.
To be oblivious to what you're doing and to whom.
There was no acting, we were just falling in love, so it was easy," Ásrún said.
Was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.
"They were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was like being on holiday in a five-star hotel in Paris."
The team were impressed with the pair's performance in the set, which moved them.
"When the camera-man, Tommi, saw this, he started to cry, he thought it was so beautiful," Atli said.
"This is just as much about love and intimacy as it is about the act itself," says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work, and Atli says that his mother heard his son's voice at the Listasafn Reykjavíkur and realized that he was a part of the work.
"She turns around and starts thinking about it," Atli said.
Mum and Dad saw this in Paris.
We haven't told anyone about this, but Dad just sent me a text saying: It was great to bump into the little family in the Palais de Tokyo," says Ásrún.
Do you think that taking part in the project has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
"We're at least still together, so maybe it's deepened that.
This deepened my bond with my in-laws at least," says Ásrún, laughing.
Asrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"It was hard not to be with you but somebody else," she says, turning to her husband.
"It was great to see it because it's just one scene in a much bigger body of work and to see it with the other pieces was really great.
It was hard for me to disconnect and I was proud.
There was a little baby in my stomach at that time," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child at the time the scene was filmed.
"It was just beautiful in there."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrún and Atli in Ástarsögur on RÚV.
Swansea reach Championship play-off final
Swansea won 1-0 against Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first match between the two teams in the semi-final of the play-offs for promotion to the English Premier League.
The game was played at the Swansea home ground in Wales.
The score at half-time was 0-0.
Swansea did get a penalty on 64 minutes, but Andre Ayew dragged his effort wide from the spot.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry of Brentford received a red card.
Brentford were reduced to 10 men for the final quarter and, in the 82nd minute, Swansea made the extra man pay.
Andre Ayew then redeemed himself by scoring a fantastic goal to secure Swansea a 1-0 win.
Swansea go 1-0 up in the play-off, with the second leg at Brentford's Griffin Park on Wednesday.
An absence of an ambassador for five years, from 2009.
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, has found himself in the spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted to arm his security detail after fearing for his life.
This, however, has not been without its challenges for U.S. presidents appointing ambassadors to Iceland.
Since April 2009, when Carol Van Voorst resigned as U.S. ambassador, there has been no U.S. ambassador in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned in unusual circumstances, with Kastljós reporting in 2009 that she had been recommended for the Medal of Merit.
Whilst en route to meet the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the Presidential Office informing her that she would not be receiving the award.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at the United States Army War College.
Sixteen months passed before Van Voorst's successor took up the post, in September 2010.
This is partly attributed to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador, but then pulled out.
Louis Ariega, who had worked for the foreign ministry for over a decade, was appointed to the post.
He resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador in Guatemala.
This was followed by another period of time without an ambassador.
Robert Barber was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in January 2015 and began his assignment, which had been vacant for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, having previously worked as a lawyer and a fundraiser for Barack Obama's presidential campaign.
He resigned when Donald Trump became president, on 20 January 2017, as is customary for political appointees.
Trump's administration has been unusually long in nominating both ambassadors and senior political appointees in Washington.
Two years later, the United States Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to testify at a hearing, where he was unanimously confirmed as the next ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony before the committee, he stated that he had never been to Iceland, but that he had visited Western Europe many times, but his wife, who has since died, was of Dutch origin.
Gunter is a political appointee who previously practiced medicine in California and has been a prominent member of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
This was founded by casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who is a fervent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter took up his duties in Iceland in May 2019, after there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for a period of two years and four months, which is the longest such gap ever recorded here.
The reason is both the length of time it took for Mr. Trump's administration to nominate people to key positions, as well as the fact that, over the past few years, the work of the Senate has slowed down considerably, including when it comes to confirming ambassadors.
Since 2009, there has been no ambassador in Iceland for a total of five years.
This has not stopped the embassy from carrying out its construction projects, which have recently opened a new headquarters in Engjateigur.
The project is estimated to have cost US$6.5 billion, and is protected by up to 10-metre-thick walls and bulletproof glass in all windows.
This, however, has not been enough for the current ambassador's sense of security, as he is said to be fearing for his life and has requested to be provided with an armed bodyguard.
A former IBV player was subjected to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former player for ÍBV, says he experienced racism when he was in Iceland, and that he regrets coming here.
This was reported by Tonny in an interview with the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, who ply their trade in Uganda's top division.
In an interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny spoke about many things, including his time in Iceland, where he played for ÍBV, Valur and Thróttur.
"When I came to Iceland, I was not playing in the middle like I was used to.
He was the captain and he was also wearing the number that I wanted, so I didn't get either of the things I wanted," said Tonny, who played right wing for ÍBV last season.
Tonny talks about the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He said that this was an issue that disproportionately affected black players in Europe.
"This has happened to me once before, but because I did not understand the language, I simply ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the case again, and then I asked my friend what the case was about.
He said to me that my opponent had made racist comments about me after I had shoved him."
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway to join Haugesund.
He goes on to say that he has made the mistakes that he regrets the most.
Tonny had not made it into the starting line-up for Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
He then asked to return to Iceland on loan, which is how he joined Val.
"It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had stayed in Norway for a bit longer, I would have got the chance I was looking for," said Tonny, who hoped that if he performed well in Norway, he would progress further.
He implies that the loan move to Iceland put paid to his hopes of joining a big European club.
Worm found in woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-inch-long black worm in the throat of a woman who came to the hospital seeking treatment.
Surgeons were able to remove the fish from the man's throat with a hook.
An investigation revealed that it was a parasite.
CNN reports on this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which is thinly sliced raw meat.
The woman's condition improved quickly after the worm was removed, but this type of parasite is often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi gained popularity in the West, cases of people contracting parasites from it have increased, according to CNN.
I am worried that we are going to see a second wave in Europe
Spain has been in the spotlight recently because of concerns about a second wave of coronavirus cases in Europe, prompting the Spanish government to re-start measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
In Catalonia, all nightlife has been shut down for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona that have seen cases surge.
Other European countries have also stepped up their response to the spread of the virus in Spain, with the UK now requiring all travellers arriving from Spain to quarantine, as is the case in Norway, and France has warned against all but essential travel to Spain.
The virus is also resurging in France and Germany, as leaders struggle to find a balance between containing the outbreak and restarting their economies.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to other parts of the world. The number of new infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 a day, with the highest number of infections in the Americas and South Asia.
The global total of confirmed cases is now more than 16 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, and the death toll is more than 644,000.
Mosaic Mural Gets Restored to Its Full Glory
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavík there is a large and deep hole.
In it, men in orange crash helmets can be seen.
There is also a large tomb there.
More compact vehicles.
The road is closed.
The walkway is narrow, and many people are now stopping to admire the artwork, made from millions of mosaic tiles – as if they've never seen it before.
Maybe they haven't seen that before.
At the very least, it didn't think about it.
It has been kept fairly low-key, with a car park directly in front of it, which was always full.
People were seen locking their cars and running off to their appointments in downtown.
"A vibrant and diverse public realm" and "a distinctively urban character" are the guiding principles behind the redevelopment of Tryggvagata.
The aim is to enhance the area and allow Gerðar Helgadóttir's mosaic at the Customs House to be better appreciated.
In front of the work will be a plaza, and since the site is well-positioned to take advantage of the sun, it was thought to be a good place for a resting area for pedestrians.
The work will be illuminated, allowing the material to take on new qualities on this 142-metre-long expanse.
There will also be small "mist jets," a kind of water sculpture, which will provide play and a certain mystical quality to the space.
This was translated from is as:Reykjavíkurborg and Veitur are carrying out the works,
The sewer, water, heat and electricity networks will be renewed.
Some of them are ancient, dating back to the 1920s, but the sewer and cold-water mains are from 1925 and have served the downtown area for almost a century.
After the reopening of the road, motor vehicles will be able to drive on it again.
However, it will become a one-way street, and at the same time, it will create a calmer and more accessible space for pedestrians.
In an article about the Customs House on the website of the Director of Customs it says that the building was opened in 1971, designed by Gísli Halldórsson.
As the harbour wall pushed into the building, a 250-metre-long, windowless facade was created on the street side.
The development committee and the architect agreed that such a plaza would have a detrimental effect on the overall street scene, unless special measures were taken to enhance the look of the building.
It was agreed by all parties that a permanent piece of work should be commissioned.
At the time, there was a lot of talk about Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, says the summary.
She had worked as a mosaic artist in Germany and elsewhere.
It was advised that the first point of contact should be with her before deciding whether or not to go ahead with a competitive tender.
It was often remarked that the work had to mirror life at the docks, since the docks had been the lifeblood of Reykjavik since its inception.
When speaking to the artist, she was so engrossed in the project that she could not stop talking about it.
It was agreed that she would be provided with drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, so that she would be able to work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður was given the time she desired, and when she returned home she made a number of suggestions for discussion.
It was unanimously decided to ask her to work on the project immediately.
Furthermore, it was requested that a general contract be made with her and the famous German company, Oidtmann, as Gerður had been working with them on the installation of famous works of art across Europe for a long time.
An agreement was reached and Gerður won the commission to create the work, which was then put together in the workshop of the brothers, who then installed it in the Customs House.
Every aspect of the operation was carried out to a very high standard, both by Guðrún Helgadóttir and by the Oidtmann brothers, according to the summary.
It has stood up well to the harsh Icelandic weather.
It took Gerður around two years to complete the work, which was made in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after completing the Toll House, at the age of 47.
Prepares to move more institutions out of the city
Iceland's Welfare Minister, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, has announced that more public institutions are to be relocated to the countryside in the near future.
This is what the minister said in Sprengisandi on Bylgjunni at noon.
Recently, it was announced that Húsnæðis- og mannvirkjastofnun's Fire Safety Department will be relocated to Sauðárkrók this autumn.
Six fire safety specialists work for the organisation, but none of them are expected to move with the organisation north, and the Fire and Emergency Management New Zealand has criticised the move.
"I think we need to push further on that.
I'm in the process of setting up the next steps for this business.
Further transport," said Ásmundur.
He says he is convinced that the overwhelming majority of the country's population wants to see more decentralisation of public services.
"I think more political decisions have to be made about moving public jobs out to the countryside, like I did with the Housing and Construction Agency, for example," said Ásmundur, who also took the example of other institutions that have been moved out to the countryside, such as Matvælastofnun, Landmælingar Íslands, and Atvinnuleysistryggingar á Skagaströnd.
All the main news from the second day of the Masters
94. Icelandic championships in track and field came to a close at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri today.
Some records were broken on the second day of competition.
It was expected to be an exciting women's javelin throw at Þórsvellir, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set an Icelandic record in javelin throw in 2014, which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR broke the record in May last year.
Vigdís regained the Icelandic record earlier this summer and has been in great form recently, having improved the Icelandic record three times already this summer.
Elísabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and was not at her best today.
She had only one valid attempt in five, throwing 25.69 metres, well short of her best.
Vigdís threw the furthest today, reaching 60.08 metres in her last attempt, which set a new competition record.
Her personal best, set earlier in July, is 62.69 metres, and she was well short of that.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day. She improved her best performance with a throw of 50.18 metres.
In the men's, FH's Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic champion in discus, won the competition with a safe victory. He threw 73.84 metres in his last throw and set a new competition record.
His personal best in the event is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympic athlete and Icelandic champion in discus, won a competition in shot put at Þórsvellir yesterday, but competed in discus today, which is his main event.
Guðni Valur's Icelandic record is 65.53m, but today he threw the furthest at 59.13m to secure the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the furthest today, he had one valid throw that was good enough for second place, 49.43 metres.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Icelandic long jump champion, won the long jump competition with a huge margin. Hafdís jumped the furthest today, 6.25 metres, which is just 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the women's 200m, it was I.R. runner Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds, but her personal best is 23.45 seconds.
Gudbjorg Jona was very successful in Akureyri, winning two gold medals yesterday in the 100m and the 4x100m relay, and today in the 4x400m relay.
In the men's 200m, Kolbeinn Hólm Gunnarsson from FH was first in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Máni Samúelsson from Ármann.
Similar to Guðbjörg Jóna winning gold in the 100m and 400m hurdles yesterday.
IS won't be fined for harvesting 27 million króna worth of Bitcoins
The Tax Appeals Commission has dismissed an application by the Revenue's Commissioner of Appeals seeking to uphold a penalty imposed on a taxpayer for underreporting his cryptocurrency trading gains.
The panel found that the tax inspector had not provided clear reasons why it was necessary to impose a fine on the man.
The Board's decision states that the Tax Inspectorate considered that the man failed to submit a correct tax return for the years 2016 and 2017.
He had also failed to report income from the sale of 2.7 million Bitcoin, either deliberately or through an act of gross negligence.
The man would have been lynched for his behaviour.
He rejected that in a letter to the board.
He was, however, convicted of fraud in 2016 for selling 27 million tokens.
In 2009 and 2010, it would have been easy and inexpensive to create a grave using normal home computers.
He pointed out that when he sold his cryptocurrency, the tax implementation for such a sale was very uncertain and unpredictable.
It is hard to imagine that the average taxpayer would have had any clue as to what was going on.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and declared his property on his tax return as the balance on his foreign currency account.
He had checked with both the experts and the tax authorities to find out how this worked, but without success.
He thought it was important to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years before he started mining Bitcoin.
As a result, he would have been in a worse position than others to understand the complex rules that the tax authorities do not have a clear opinion on.
As a result of this, the man believed that it was appropriate to reassess his taxes for the two years in question and apply a penalty, but that in other respects he would not be penalised.
He reiterated that he works in Iceland and has paid taxes here since 2012.
He would never have shirked his duties in an inappropriate way.
The demand for restitution would be out of the question, and he would be saddled with enormous debts.
Brynjólfur causes a stir: "This fellow knows what football is all about"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has divided opinion since his arrival at Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max-deildinni.
Blik will be in the spotlight tonight when they take on ÍA in a live broadcast on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is suspended for four yellow cards during the season, so he will not be on the pitch with a new haircut as he has been so far during the season.
He had written "blah, blah, blah" on his head for the match against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I'm not sure exactly who he was answering to with the payment, but that certainly made an impression on me.
He was not hiding.
He wants the ball every time, and if someone was going to equalize, I thought he would do it or make something happen," Guðmundur Benediktsson said in the Pepsi Max Lounge after being asked about Brynjólfur.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
"It's hard sometimes to work out what position he's in.
He looks a bit more left-footed as the game goes on, but he has a very flexible role in the team," said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólfur is a real entertainer and is happy to have such a colourful person in the team: "There is no doubt that this is a character.
He's a fun guy, and I love his hair, and he's always available for an interview.
It's amazing how passionate people are about him, which tells me he really understands the game.
"I am an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people, to entertain."
People are reading the interview with Brynjólfur, people are paying to get in and watch his next move.
This man is a genius," said Máni.
KR player says he wants to leave - "I have been in contact with a few teams in the second division"
KR Pepsi Max-leikmaðurinn Tobias Thomsen looks set to leave the club.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country, but to do so he will have to first terminate his contract with KR, as the Danish league starts before the Icelandic one.
The club understands I miss Denmark and have been very supportive," Tobias told Bold.
"I have been in contact with a few teams in the B Division and will probably move before the Icelandic season has finished.
There aren't many teams in Denmark who can afford to buy me out of my contract with KR."
He said that he will probably have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
"Companies in Denmark have probably felt the economic impact of the virus more than companies in Iceland."
Cyclist thief Bjartmar recovers stolen bikes worth millions - now he's being sued by DV
For the past year, Bjartmar Leósson has had an interest that most people do not share.
He pounces on and recovers stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Has Bjartmar earned the nickname "bike whisperer" as a result?
Yesterday, there was quite a fuss when a man published an account of his conversations with Bjartmar.
DV referred to discussions on the Facebook group of Vesturbæ residents, where it was stated that Bjartmar had spoken to the man in Austurstræti and said that the scooter might have been stolen.
Wasn't it obvious from the original writings of the raft man, that Bjartmar had stolen it?
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the original DV headline has been updated to reflect that.
Bjartmar said that the original reports on the matter did not reflect at all what really happened at Austurvelli yesterday.
Bjartmar stated that he had received information from the victim of a rollercoaster rape that this was, in fact, his rollercoaster.
The information was received by the alleged owner from someone else, but the information turned out to be false, says Bjartmar.
"I saw the guy and I recognized the shuttle, even though I had been looking for it for a long time and it had been missing for a long time.
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to drive the shuttle, I decided to address the man.
The owner was adamant that he was right and I decided to have a chat with him.
I'm very good at these kinds of things, but before I could say what I wanted to say, the guy had interrupted me."
Bjartmar says that the man in the electric cart offered to show him the receipt for the bicycles, and called the police himself.
"Yeah, cool," said Bjartmar, "let's just get it done."
As a result, the owner of the electric scooter was able to prove ownership of his electric scooter and drove away.
Later, the rightful owner of the segway shared his story on Facebook, as reported in an earlier story.
In the space of a little over a year since he started this practice, Bjartmar says he can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times he's ended up on the outsider with a group of people.
"I've been having friendly conversations with the most difficult men in Reykjavík," said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are usually the smallest brothers and sisters of society, drug addicts, mentally handicapped people and others who for some reason end up on the streets.
"Addiction is a demanding landlord, and somehow the next fix needs to be financed, unfortunately, theft is an easy way to do this," says Bjartmar.
"The relationships that I have with these people are so good that I'm actually bringing a lot of them on board to work with me.
There are examples of people going through treatment and getting better and coming back and helping me with what I'm doing," he said.
In general, Bjartmar gets along well with cyclists.
Someone may know him and what he is doing, and politely offer to show them his logbook, wheel numbers, etc.
Bicycle theft is a large problem that has received little coverage.
Bjartmar further explains that the police are now even directing people who have stolen bicycles to him.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with DV's previous coverage and says that he is not some kind of vigilante in personal pursuit of justice.
When asked if he was not, in fact, skating on thin ice with his behaviour, and if it was not, in the first place, the job of the police, Bjartmar said that, of course, he was.
"Needless to say, the police should be doing this, but the fact of the matter is that they're not.
For example, I have watched police officers drive away in their cars from a large pile of stolen bicycles.
She is, quite frankly, useless on this topic."
"If the police aren't doing anything about it, and it's right there in your face, and the experience has been made that I can get something done, why not?" Bjartmar asked.
He claims to have recovered such a large number of stolen bicycles that he sometimes runs into his "clients" on the street, and they just give Bjartmar the bikes they had previously stolen.
The times when Bjartmar has called the police for help and they haven't shown up.
"This is not working with the police, and it's not my fault, and it's not the bicyclists' fault," Bjartmar said, lamenting that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer because the police aren't doing anything about it.
There is no dispute about Bjartmar's success.
There are many stories across the country of people thanking Bartram for returning their possessions.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long since lost count of the number of bicycles he has handed in, and that the figures are surely in the millions, if not the tens of millions.
Vega has electric scooters, electric bikes and electric tricycles, which are heavy, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a preschool during the day, and every other weekend he works at a hostel.
His hunt for bicycles is a labour of love in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a big anniversary year for pension funds in Iceland.
Officers had received their pensions from the Danish King throughout the 19th century, but in 1919 a public servants' pension scheme was set up, which eventually became the general pension scheme for all public servants.
The basis for the current pension schemes of the general working population was then laid with the general wage agreement of 1969, which stipulated that employment-related pension schemes would be compulsory with full-employment pension savings from the start of 1970.
In 1974, the laws were passed based on this agreement, and the pension system continued to grow after that.
The pension system was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century won through the struggle for better wages.
In the historic 1955 Woolworth's strike, unemployment benefits had been won in a similar way, and the organisation had been gradually winning improvements in sick pay, pensions, holiday pay, shorter hours, better housing and so on, which made a real difference to people's lives.
All these rights cost a lot of hard work and struggle, but in hindsight, proved to be much more valuable and long-lasting than the temporary increase in wages, which was immediately eaten up by inflation, which characterised the post-war period right up until 1990, as many will remember.
The prelude to the establishment of the general pension scheme in 1969 was both long and complex.
While it was agreed in the end that the funds would in fact belong to their members, the trade unions had to agree that the boards would be made up of an equal number of representatives for employers and members.
In the years after the founding of the funds, the demand for majority worker representation on the boards of the funds was often discussed by labor unions, but never came to fruition. As a result, we still have the bizarre situation where worker representatives are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.
In Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on compulsory pension insurance and the activities of pension funds, there is a section dealing with the investment policy of the funds.
In I.1 it says that "the pension fund shall have the welfare of its members at heart."
Also in point 5 it says: "Pension funds shall set themselves ethical guidelines for their investments."
In Lífeyrissjóður Verslunarmanna's corporate governance principles are as follows, as a result of the aforementioned legislation:
The Pension Fund is a signatory to the United Nations (UN PRI) Principles for Responsible Investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and asset managers in the West and Europe.
This document explains how an emphasis on environmental, social and governance factors, as well as strong corporate stewardship, can contribute to the long-term success of investment portfolios.
This means that the interests of investors and the objectives of society as a whole go hand in hand.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those listed on a stock exchange, adopt a public policy on: good corporate governance, fair remuneration and social responsibility, and the environment.
Gildi pension fund, which is one of the largest pension funds in the country, has adopted a "corporate governance policy" which has similar provisions.
This is all brought back here as an introduction to the latest buzzword in Icelandic, “shadow governance”.
As the term is new in the language, there is no official definition for it. However, the following seems to be the most common one: When a trade union leader says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the trade union to the board of a pension fund with instructions or instructions on how they should take a stance on a particular issue.
If they do not comply, they will be removed from office at the next available opportunity.
If the leader does not take this to the media, and does not talk about the resignation, then it is not "backdoor governance" after all, since such communication between people is common in the financial world, as well as elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to decide which is the "darker path."
As of this writing (Saturday, July 25, 2020), there are at least two men who have attempted to define this term.
This is Hörður Ægisson, journalist for Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland.
The reason behind both was that Icelandair's CEO, Bogi Nils Bogason, had stated his intention to terminate the airline's collective agreement with flight attendants and air traffic controllers (to make them redundant), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the president of the Icelandic Retail Workers' Union, had sent a letter to the representatives of the Icelandic Retail Workers' Union on the Board of Directors of the Icelandic Retail Workers' Pension Fund urging them not to support the potential acquisition of shares in the company, or they would be asked to leave.
A little later, Bogi Nilsen reversed his decision, and as a result, Ragnar Þór followed suit with his recommendation, which of course was based on Bogi's decision.
Nonetheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to discuss the matter in detail in the Friday edition of Fréttablaðið, using strong words about shadow management, violations of the law, and a strong need to change the law.
Here, a small acorn was certainly expected to produce a large oak tree, even though the acorn was in the passive voice and was also obliterated before it could do so.
As this is an important matter, let's focus on the substance at the end.
I explained above the points in the pension law that are relevant to this matter.
This means that the trustees have to look after the interests of the pension scheme members and have ethical guidelines in their investments, and this is spelled out in more detail in the statutes of both Gildi and the Icelandic Trade Workers' Pension Fund, as I mentioned.
Pension funds, on the other hand, are NOT supposed to focus on short-term profitability in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous path to take, and there are plenty of examples from history where large amounts of money from banks and other financial institutions have been lost to fraudsters and eco-terrorists, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was clearly on thin ice when he thought it was a good idea to remove an entire group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed on the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-à-vis investors.
As it turns out, he saw the error and fixed it.
Time will tell whether this is enough to ensure that the pension funds' investment in the company will stand up to scrutiny by scheme members.

One of the infected did not observe home quarantine
One of the three new Covid-19 cases announced in the country yesterday, was infected while travelling from the Baltic state of Latvia on July 15 - around a week ago.
He is an Icelander who does not live here on a permanent basis and therefore did not receive clear instructions to follow the so-called home quarantine after arrival in the country and to take another test a few days after arrival.
He tested negative in the screening at the border.
"He is in Icelandic society, and in fact, he should be in this scheme," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert on infectious diseases at the Icelandic Institute of Public Health and a deputy to the Chief Medical Officer while he is on leave, in a conversation with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form and it is not compulsory to put down your national ID number and if you don't put it down you are not automatically registered for the second test."
She said that the man could have used the English form because he is actually resident abroad, but due to his Icelandic contacts he should have used the Icelandic form.
However, he did not realize what was going on.
"If you don't register, you will have to come back yourself to get the second test.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realised that this was the right course of action," says Kamilla.
"It is clear that we need to improve the information we give out while we try to find a way to automate the system so that people don't have to go through the process of registering their identity number.
Or, if possible, make it obvious who the participants in Icelandic society are in the registration system," she explains.
As it turns out, the individual in question was fortunately only minimally exposed upon arrival in the country, even though he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six people have been quarantined since yesterday's case, and all six of those people have been in close contact with the patient.
They are all scheduled for testing, but two of them are showing symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man tested positive for the virus after arriving at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says it is likely that he was recently infected and that the virus had not been detected at the time the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the possibility that the man was infected in Iceland, but that he did not bring the virus to Iceland.
"It is not really the case that this is definitely an imported infection because it has been so long since he arrived in the country that it is highly unlikely that he has been exposed here in the way that these two have been exposed in relation to the sporting events."
However, she said that this is highly unlikely because of how few people he would have come into contact with.
"It is highly unlikely," says Kamilla, but she stresses that it cannot be ruled out until the Icelandic Genetics Institute has sequenced the virus in the man.
"If you get a virus that you haven't seen before, it's almost certain that it's been brought in."
Pepper spray and rubber bullets used against protesters
There was a skirmish between law enforcement and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and non-lethal projectiles against the protesters, who broke windows and set things on fire.
Forty-five protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Protests against police brutality and racism spread across the U.S. last night, with demonstrations in Seattle in solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was fatally shot.
The BBC reports that the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A mob of people set fire to construction materials and smashed the windows of the city's courthouse.
In the aftermath, law enforcement declared the protest a riot, and there were skirmishes between protesters and law enforcement.
In Aurora, Colo., Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was hurt.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the Nation of Islam gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March.
The group carried firearms and marched to a police roadblock where the group was warded off from a group of non-violent protesters who were also carrying firearms.
In Omaha, Nebraska, 75 people were arrested after protesters remembered 22-year-old James Scurlock, a black man who was fatally shot by a white bartender in May.
Solskjær: No game defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of today's game against Leicester in the final match of the English Premier League.
If United lose, and Chelsea do not draw against Wolves, then Solskjaer's team will finish in fifth and miss out on Champions League football.
However, they still have hope of qualifying for the Champions League next season, if they can win the Europa League next month.
"We're not at the finish line.
"If we can get a result against Leicester, I think people will look back and say it wasn't such a bad season," Solskjaer said.
"Whatever happens, this is not going to be the end of our journey because we've still got a long way to go to catch the teams above us," Solskjaer said.
It is understood that nerves will be frayed at 15:00 today, but Solskjaer did his best to treat it like any other match.
"It's always going to be about the last game of the season, and if you want to be at Manchester United you've got to get used to that.
This is nothing new, and it is on this foundation that the club was built.
We've created a fantastic opportunity to end the season on a high, now it's down to us to take it," said Solskjaer.
"This is not the most important game of the season, it's just the next one.
Anybody in football will tell you, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our time period, we've already had so many defining moments in our time period."
"Bruno Fernandes has made such a difference for us, and overall I feel we're more solid, more physical, more robust," Solskjaer said.
65,000 cases per day
65,490 new COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States yesterday, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University.
To date, 4,178,021 cases have been reported in the United States of America.
900 people died from the virus yesterday, bringing the total for the past four days to more than 1,000 per day.
To date, 146,460 deaths have been attributed to the virus in the United States.
CNN reports that according to the projections of the US epidemiological authorities, the number of deaths caused by the virus will reach 175,000 on 15 August.
Fear second wave of coronavirus
Spanish officials are struggling to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health officials reported more than 920 new daily Covid-19 cases on Thursday and Friday.
This is the first new case to emerge from the island in over a week, and comes as Spain begins to ease some of the strictest coronavirus restrictions in Europe.
The backlash has meant that the UK is now requiring travellers arriving from Spain to quarantine.
A week previously, Spain was on Britain's list of safe countries.
The situation is most critical in Catalonia in northeast Spain, where the regional government has imposed a stricter lockdown to try to contain the surge in infections.
In the city of Barcelona, bars and discos will be closed for two weeks, and nightclubs will be required to close at midnight.
There is now a lockdown in place for 200,000 people in the Segria region of western Catalonia.
It is believed that Britain's decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on foreign tourists and has been hit hard by the pandemic.
Thomson, the UK's biggest holiday firm, cancelled all its flights due to depart to mainland Spain and the Canaries today.
Countries around the world are reportedly gearing up for a second wave of the virus, but there is little appetite to re-institute widespread lockdowns that have devastated economies.
For example, Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, has taken a very dim view of it, likening it to a nuclear weapon that he does not want to use.
France's Prime Minister, Jean Castex, has said that the country "would not survive, economically or socially," if a nationwide lockdown was re-imposed.
Many policy makers hope that the local measures, which are applicable to a particular city, town or area, will be enough to stop the spread of the virus in the next phase of the pandemic.
Five new cases in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic cases were reported yesterday, along with two additional cases at the border.
Five people tested positive for Covid-19 in Iceland yesterday.
In a statement, the Civil Defence said that one of the cases was linked to the ReyCUP football tournament where cases of infection were reported yesterday.
He has been quarantined, and sixteen people who had been in close contact with him have also been quarantined.
The infected person had been participating in activities of a sports club in Reykjavik and was, according to the announcement, "only a part of the sports team" in quarantine.
Others who have been issued quarantine orders have been in contact with the man.
The source of this outbreak has not been identified and an investigation is underway by the State Epidemiologist's Office.
The organisers of the ReyCUP have followed the guidelines and regulations of the Chief Medical Officer and Civil Protection Authorities, which are still in force, and have made the appropriate arrangements.
However, pictures from yesterday's game caught the eye as it was a very emotional moment for the players to celebrate their team's good performance on the pitch.
A statement was posted to the event's Facebook page at approximately 11:00 today.
Please note: Parents are asked to respect the rule that participants should collect their own belongings from the school.
This is not something that parents are allowed to do.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another case was reported yesterday, but is not related to the case reported yesterday.
In a statement, they said: "Icelandic Genetics has sequenced the samples and a new variant of the virus has been identified, which has not previously been detected in Iceland."
The investigation is ongoing, and the person who has tested positive is in isolation, and 12 people have been quarantined because of the exposure.
The third case involves an individual who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on 15 July.
He was reported from the southwest region of the country.
The person is now in isolation, and six people who have been in close contact with him are in quarantine.
Two of them have already started showing symptoms of the virus.
In addition, two cases were reported at the border, and further investigations are pending, including the process for border control of infection at the border.
Finally, the statement concludes: The Icelandic National Police and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer urge people to take precautions and pay close attention to individual protection against infection.
If there is any doubt about whether someone has Covid-19 symptoms, they will be asked to attend their local health clinic for testing.
Patriksfjordur says camping site full for Easter weekend - Directs visitors to another site
The campsite at Patreksfirði is full over the weekend, according to a statement from Vesturbyggð.
He pointed out to the audience that they should consider other accommodation options.
Western District, Bíldudal, Tálknafjörður, Melanes á Rauðasandi, Flókalundur Hotel and Breiðavík Hotel are mentioned as alternatives.
There is a lot going on in Patreksfjörður this weekend, as the town is hosting Skjaldborg, the Icelandic Documentary Festival, for the fourth year in a row.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
Based on the interest in the campground, we can expect a good turnout this year if the weather cooperates, but DV reported earlier today that the forecast is not good.
However, expect the worst weather conditions in the south, and hope for the best for Patreksfirðingar.
The bb.is website reported first that all other accommodations in the town were full.
A whole block of flats collapsed in the best place in the city
Romanian labourers live for free at No. 18–20 on Dunhaga.
While the building's owners have been seeking a building permit for the renovations, the application has been mired in red tape for three years.
In one of the oldest, most established, and most expensive residential districts of Reykjavík, stands a large, three-storey apartment building.
The ground floor of the building has around 600 square metres of retail space.
To the rear of the building there are two staircases, each with four reasonably sized flats.
They are between 93 and 130 square metres, though most are over 100.
The building has a long history.
It was built in 1959 and has housed a video library, Skóstofan, the MS Mjólkurbúð, a gunsmith, a fish shop and most recently Háskólaprent.
It has, to put it mildly, seen better days.
It is severely damaged right now, as you can see from the pictures below.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
According to the business registry, the owners of D18 ehf. are Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir, among others.
Magnús was in charge of the Borgun owner group and was the managing director of the Borgun property company.
Stálskip ehf. is one of the shareholders of Borgun ehf.
Icelandic Steel Ships ehf. is the investment company of Guðrúnar Helgu Lárusdóttur and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third share in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, ran the shipping company Stálskip at one time.
D18 ehf. purchased the house in the summer of 2009 and since then, it has not been maintained at all.
Neighbours say it has deteriorated progressively over the years, but most recently.
In the Facebook group of the neighborhood, one resident wrote that the building had been "in a state of disrepair for the last few years."
This may be because the owners have, for a number of years, sought to change the building and the site.
Neighbours say the property had not been in a good state of repair for some time.
"It is long overdue to do something about that site and it's unfortunate that it's taken so long."
He also said that he was angry at the building's owners for not completing it, finding a compromise with the neighbors, and calling it "this legal quagmire."
"Just work with the community to make sure that we can push this through and get it done."
The "legal tangle" the inhabitant refers to is the process of redeveloping the site, which has been ongoing at least since 2017.
Then, the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 requested permission to build an extra floor on top of the existing apartment building, as well as a new elevator house and an extension on one floor, with a basement.
The building permit issued for that project was challenged to the Administrative Court of Iceland, which ruled that the permit was null and void as the project was not in accordance with the local development plan and the public notification was not satisfactory.
Reykjavíkurborg then started the development plan process, which culminated in an announcement in the Stjórnartíðindi last July.
This was also challenged and overturned by the courts in March 2020.
At this stage, it has been nearly three years since the original building application was lodged, and the owners of the property are at the beginning of the process.
It had fallen into a state of disrepair and was beginning to upset the neighbours.
When DV asked the neighbours about the situation and their reactions, they answered in various ways.
Some understood the owner's intentions, others did not.
Some directed their anger at the city, others did not.
They were angry, but not at anyone in particular.
Some have said that parking is an issue, but neighbours have been using the unused parking spaces at Dunhaga 18-20 for their cars.
One complainant in the case said that he was fed up with red tape:
"To have to go through that process three times is unbelievable.
It's like Reykjavíkurborg can't read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and in a state of disrepair.
A monument to the woeful state of the city's governance and the noble intentions of the owner and the many years of work that went into it, now at a crossroads.
When a reporter approached 18, Dunhaga, he found open doors and a pile of rubbish.
Playstation 3 and new TV lay among the other rubbish on the ground – victims of Icelandic summer heat.
The door was open in the old University Printing Office and there were a lot of cats in there, judging by the smell.
Someone or something has taken refuge in one of the corners, but is not visible.
Stacks of couches and beds and piles of geology pages, probably destined to become a book, greeted me.
The flat's internal staircase was also open, and there was life up in both of them.
A reporter was so lucky as to come across a resident of one of them.
Here, a group of Romanians are cooking a potato dish for dinner, and invited the reporter to join them.
The Romanians work for the Ztrongforce Ltd. employment agency.
They have been there for some time and according to DV's sources, the company has not paid for the premises, except for heat and electricity.
As a result of the condition of the property, it was deemed inadvisable to collect rent.
From the post boxes in the lobby of the building, it is evident that a large number of foreign workers have been living there in recent years.
The pandemic has hit staffing agencies hard, as the reduction in international travel has meant a downturn in the construction industry and these two sectors have been the most likely to use the services of a staffing agency.
However, it seems that the residents of Dunhaga 18 have plenty to keep them busy, and they've left their work gloves and mittens in the common area to dry after a long day in the rain.
As it turns out, the boys were living in a reasonably well-maintained flat, despite the dismal state of the rest of the building.
When a reporter said goodbye to the Romanian boys, he was suddenly struck by the irony: In the best place in Reykjavik, a 1,500 m2 property has collapsed.
The owners want to improve the property and their neighbours want to make it better, but they can't agree on what "improvement" means.
In between, the city's planning department sits on the hot seat, a victim of an endless stream of appeals and review possibilities in the planning process, and a slow-moving Planning Appeals Commission.
In the building live Romanian labourers, perhaps those who will improve the situation when the Icelanders stop arguing.
This was originally published in DV's weekend edition on July 17.
In a bid to combat obesity in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to give £10m to an obesity-prevention programme, which will include a ban on fast-food advertising, after he was admitted to hospital with a severe bout of obesity-related illness.
Mr Johnson is expected to launch the Better Health campaign on Monday, which will encourage doctors to prescribe cycling to patients with obesity, and there will also be a drive to increase the number of cycle routes.
Broadcast television in the UK will be banned from showing adverts for fast-food restaurants after 21:00, according to UK media sources.
"COVID-19 has brought into sharp focus the short- and long-term health risks of obesity, and the Prime Minister is committed to using this time to help people become healthier, more active and make better food choices," said a government spokesperson.
Johnson himself has struggled with weight, but he was hospitalized earlier this year after contracting COVID-19, and his illness is partly attributed to that.
Women are better suited than men to lead the changes
She said that the new constitution is the biggest step the country can take towards more decentralization, transparency, and fighting against corruption, and for the common good.
"We need to shift gears a bit now and I think the group that is better equipped to lead that type of change is the community that has an easier time living those values.
It's women," Helga said.
"Icelandic women are famous for their sisterhood.
To be: to stand together and with each other in leading change.
So, it's now up to us to make sure that these changes are made."
She said that she was slightly uncomfortable with the focus on Iceland as "the best in the world" in terms of gender equality and human rights.
"We are not quite there in terms of being ready to look at what we need to do.
As Germans are very aware of their history, they are very good at preserving everything.
It's a lot.
We have to know where we come from, we have to know our history, we have to listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalised groups.
We don't have the same rules here," Helga said.
When asked, she said that women are, in many ways, doing well in Iceland, but added that, like in many other places, Icelandic men still have a very masculine outlook.
She stated that politics revolve around self-interest, domination and power, which are the forces that sustain inequalities in all societies.
"Women have now set up this group and are meeting, and they are quite irritated that the Parliament seems to be side-stepping this 2012 national referendum," she said.
"It's the feminine qualities that we are looking at really.
From human rights and environmental protection, to cooperation and the fact that we all really do sit around the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the underlying principles of the new constitution.
"We are a very rich country in terms of natural resources and it is unacceptable that there are people who live in poverty.
It doesn't make sense, we can do it differently," said Helga.
"It is illogical to assume that there is some kind of natural law that says that jobs for women are always going to be paid less than jobs for men.
It is ridiculous for air stewardesses and nurses to have to fight for decent pay all the time."

Attempted mugging of a pedestrian in the centre of town
A man has been arrested in the city centre overnight after he threatened a pedestrian and tried to mug him for money.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbæ where two people were arrested in connection with the case.
The police stopped a motorcyclist in Hlíðum as he was travelling at 146 km/klst in a 60 km/klst zone.
In addition, he had his license revoked previously.
The Metropolitan Police had a busy night with over 80 incidents being dealt with between 5pm last night and 5am this morning.
There were a lot of noise complaints during that time.
There were eleven reports of loud parties in the early hours of Saturday, which the police considered to be a major incident.
Last night, however, 22 noise complaints were filed with the police.
Six men were taken into custody overnight.
In Árbæ, police were called last night after shots were fired.
They had managed to escape before the police arrived.
Nine motorists were stopped for drunk or drug-driving.
Four people have been arrested for fighting in the city centre overnight, with one of them being remanded in custody.
Two people were taken to the emergency room after they were hit in the face, one in downtown and one in Vesturbær.
One person was taken to hospital after sustaining an injury while bouncing on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who was dragging a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The vehicle's wheels were in a "very poor condition," according to the police log, and were therefore immobilized.
Where to stay during the holidays: Monet's house
The house the Impressionist Claude Monet lived in for the last 40 years of his life is now available to rent on Airbnb.
The next available nights in the hostel are over the holiday weekend.
This is a small and adorable house, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
There are three bedrooms, two sitting rooms and three bathrooms in the house.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous garden at this house.
If you are going to rent the house, you have to rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb website, it is still available in about a week's time, on Sunday after the Easter weekend, so it could be a good option for some holidaymakers looking for a last-minute break.
During the two nights of the shopping holiday, you will pay USD 964 or just under ISK 130,000, according to Fréttablaðið.
Hundreds in quarantine, some showing symptoms of coronavirus
Five domestic cases have been reported in the past three days, and most of the cases are not related.
Hundreds of people have been quarantined as a result of this, and some of them are showing symptoms of the disease the virus causes.
Three domestic cases and two overseas cases were reported yesterday.
A senior official at the Health Protection Agency said that the increase in domestic cases did not necessarily mean that the virus was spreading more widely through the community.
"The domestic case that has been sequenced so far is an entirely new virus that has not been seen before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been circulating undetected in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has only recently arrived in the country, but of course we need to be on our guard now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert on infectious diseases at the Directorate of Health.
The majority of cases have been in individuals who have come into contact with people who have returned from abroad.
More tests will be carried out in the coming days, but some of those who have been in contact with the infected people have started to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now we do not have influenza circulating, and there are fewer other respiratory infections, so we can be a bit more liberal with this testing of individuals who would have been at risk of having something else done first if they had been diagnosed with influenza at that time," said Kamilla.
The tracing of these cases is almost complete, but it is not ruled out that some will have to go into quarantine.
Two of the cases were infected after attending sporting events.
Has this raised questions about the appropriateness of holding such an event?
The head of emergency response communications says that as long as people follow guidelines and protocols, it's going to be fine.
Kamilla says it is highly unlikely that the cases were contracted at the sporting event.
"If we don't have additional cases arising from that individual attending that sporting event, then we can say that our mitigation at that event worked.
We don't know yet," Kamilla said.
The complaint against the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Bureau is constantly reviewed.
"We will be ready to provide further advice or restrictions if needed," Kamilla said.
After just under a week, it is expected that the limit of 1,000 people will be lifted.
This new position could have ramifications for relaxing those restrictions.
"A certain mindfulness in cooking" - see Eliza Reid's menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an accomplished football player who plays for Vals.
She is also a masters student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a nutritionist.
She needs a lot of energy for the daily grind, and she always manages to find time to cook a good, nutritious meal.
A normal day for me starts with work around eight in the morning," says Elísa.
"After work, I go to the grocery store to prepare the dinner before picking up my daughter from kindergarten at three o'clock."
Elisabeth finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter from the nursery early.
"It's good to have time with her before I go to training in the afternoon.
After a workout, it's nice to come home and not have to warm up the food.
In the evenings, after she's asleep, we'll often watch one episode of something to wind down."
Elísa doesn't follow any particular diet.
She is in the final stages of completing her master's thesis in nutrition, so she knows well what foods give her the energy to work, study, family, and exercise.
"It's a matter of eating a variety of foods that are well balanced in terms of protein, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food, not to label food as good or bad, but rather nutritious or unhealthy.
It's okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not very often."
Elísa has a very keen interest in cooking.
"I find a certain meditative quality to being in the kitchen and I like that a lot.
I have to say I have confidence in the kitchen and I genuinely believe I'm a good chef."
Breakfast: oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, soak overnight in almond milk.
Top off your meal with whatever is available.
It's usually banana and toasted muesli & COFFEE.
I'm a big coffee drinker.
A snack: Surprisingly variable, but includes fruit or vegetables, rye bread with butter or cheese, cottage cheese with banana and cereals, and I could probably eat a tub of hummus with a spoon.
Lunch: I often make a variety of salads using whatever is in the fridge, quinoa or bulgur, falafel balls, roasted vegetables with a good dressing - that's what I'm working on at the moment.
If the setup completely falls apart (which happens a lot) then the egg cooker at work has saved my bacon a number of times, and that's two slices of buttered toast with cheese and an egg, your mileage may vary.
I'll have some carbohydrate-heavy foods before a workout, like a sandwich, some cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is a very common dinner choice in my home, otherwise it's a selection of delicious vegetarian dishes.
Seattle police clash with protesters
The city of Seattle, Washington, has declared a riot after a large protest in downtown.
Yesterday, law enforcement officers used tear gas and pepper spray in an attempt to clear a large area that protesters had occupied and stretched across many city blocks from the Capitol.
Police said at least 11 protesters had been arrested and an investigation was underway into vandalism at a police station in the city overnight, possibly with explosives.
According to the city and law enforcement officials, protesters threw rocks, bottles, bricks, and other objects at police, and one officer was hospitalized with injuries.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They were deployed to show solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there have been repeated clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal agents.
Here, as in many other cities in the United States, people have come together under the banner of Black Lives Matter, mourned the death of George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protested against systemic racism in the American society, and called for action.
No results are reversed until after the vote.
It is still not clear whether the termination of the Icelandair flight attendants, which is to take effect at the beginning of next month, will be retracted.
The electronic vote on a collective agreement between the Icelandair cabin crew and the Icelandair Cabin Crew Association will close at midday tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the chairwoman of the company, says she is certain that Icelandair will not take a decision on the redundancies until the outcome of the vote has been determined.
"This is definitely connected," says Guðlaug Líney.
"There have been no retimings, this has to be cleared up so that we can fly the aircraft.
"People are very eager to find out if they will have work after the first of the month."
Vote on whether to accept a deal brokered a week earlier, on the night of July 19.
It is envisaged that it will remain in place until the end of September 2025, and is based on an agreement previously accepted by the cabin crew.
On July 17, the Icelandair Cabin Crew Association's Board and Executive Committee unanimously approved a call for an all-island wide work stoppage, which was ratified by the members in a vote.
This was never going to happen, but it was decided in the wake of Icelandair's decision to pull out of negotiations with the Icelandair Cabin Crew Association, to sack all its cabin crew and seek a collective agreement with a different trade union.
Then the airline's pilots were to take on the role of security personnel on board on a temporary basis.
When asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's difficult to say.
"People are reeling from Icelandair's act of aggression, where all the female flight attendants were sacked and it was announced that there would be a new collective agreement with a different trade union.
We'll have to see if that makes any difference," she said.
940 air stewardesses were working for Icelandair at the end of April, but 900 of them, about 95%, had been made redundant.
Their notice periods vary from three months to as little as one week for those with the shortest length of service, finishing around the middle of the month, between July and August.
Some 90% of Icelandair's female flight attendants are part of this group.
What's going to happen if they don't agree?
"We look forward to continuing to talk with our counterparts.
This agreement is a response to Icelandair's requirements.
If rejected, however, it is clear that it went too far for airline staff.'
Voting on the collective agreement closes and Icelandair will announce its results for the second quarter of the year tomorrow
Voting on a new collective agreement for air stewardesses will close at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's third-quarter results for the year will also be published tomorrow, with preliminary results showing a 85 per cent fall in revenue from the same period last year.
An electronic vote on the Icelandair collective agreement between the Icelandic Airline Cabin Crew Association and the Icelandic Business Association commenced on Wednesday, July 22, and closes at 12 noon on Monday, July 27.
Those who are eligible to vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the Icelandair Cabin Crew Association.
Icelandair and the Icelandic Airline Pilots Association (FFÍ) signed a new collective agreement on Sunday, July 19th, after Icelandair ended negotiations with the association on Friday, after airline stewardesses had voted to reject the previous agreement in a ballot at the beginning of July.
Icelandair had laid off all its flight attendants and pilots on Friday, but those cuts were reversed after a new collective bargaining agreement was reached.
Under the new collective agreement, air stewardesses will have to fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The contract is valid until 2025, and it has been combined with the flight attendants' and pilots' regulations to determine the maximum length of a shift.
The agreement was presented to FFÍ members last Monday at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel, and many female flight attendants whom the Press spoke to expressed their dissatisfaction with the agreement.
However, most seemed to agree that the deal would have to be accepted in order to keep FFÍ alive.
Icelandair's second-quarter results for 2019 will be announced tomorrow. According to preliminary results, the company's EBIT, operating profit excluding interest, taxes and amortisation, is expected to be negative by 100 to 110 million US dollars, or approximately ISK 15 billion.
Icelandair sent a preliminary report to the stock exchange last Wednesday, which stated that the company's revenue for the quarter was around US$6 million, or ISK 8.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, available cash and cash equivalents were around US$154 million, or approximately ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair is also planning to seek outside investment in August.
Icelandair is aiming to finalize agreements with fifteen lenders, the Icelandic government, and Boeing aircraft manufacturer, before the end of the month, before proceeding with a share offering.
This is a new variant, not a new species of virus
"A new variant means it's someone who's come into the country.
This is not something that has been cooking here in Iceland," says Már Kristjánsson, an infectious diseases specialist at Landspítalan, about the news that a "new type of virus" has been discovered here in Iceland.
Three domestic cases were reported yesterday, and two at the border.
One person who has tested positive had been involved in the activities of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the source of the infection has not been found and contact tracing is underway.
One case was diagnosed in an individual who arrived in the country on 15 July, and two people he had been in contact with have begun showing symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday a case was identified that was related to a case that was reported yesterday, and after sequencing at Íslensk erfðagreining, a "new variant of the virus was identified that had not been previously detected in Iceland."
The smear has been contained and the investigation is ongoing.
Már stresses that this is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to say a new strain of that virus, rather than a new species of virus.
What does it mean and whether it could be a sign of a second wave? Már says that as far as we know, it's a one-off case and it could be that nothing more will come of it.
"However, if we get cases that are not connected internationally but are of the same lineage as this particular variant, then we can draw that conclusion [of a second wave], but it's premature at the moment," said Már.
Happiness in a hot tub
Is the secret to Icelandic happiness found in the hot springs?
BBC's programme-makers have produced a similar, fun video, which throws light on the nation's obsession with swimming pools and hot tubs.
Iceland's bath culture is unique in the world, and it is claimed that there are more bathing places per capita in Iceland than anywhere else in the world.
The natural geothermal heat is the base, but also the tradition of swimming in lakes.
Swimming lessons for children were made compulsory in 1940, but older citizens are just as keen to use the hot springs for health reasons.
Boating is considered a large part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class or status.
In the absence of mobile phones, people chat informally about anything and everything, or benefit from the soothing power of water: contemplating, reflecting, recharging mind and body.
A steep climb to the hundred-day mark in the run-up to the elections
One hundred days away from Election Day, Americans will go to the polls to choose their next president for the next four years.
Donald Trump seeks re-election, but he faces an uphill battle.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, has a significant lead over Trump on a national level, according to opinion polls.
According to a new AP-NORC poll, a record number of Americans think the country is headed in the wrong direction.
Trump's response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans than ever before believe that the president has mishandled the economy.
Specifically, only two out of ten Americans say that America is on the right track.
32 percent said they supported Trump's response to the pandemic, and 48 percent said he has handled the economy well.
In March it stood at 56 per cent and in January at 67 per cent.
According to FiveThirtyEight's average of polls, Biden is at 49.9 percent nationwide, while Trump is at 41.9 percent.
Trump has tried to refocus attention away from his own lacklustre response to the pandemic on Joe Biden, stoking culture wars and pushing policies that he claims are about law and order.
Biden's campaign is focused on keeping the spotlight on Trump, and they see a good chance of winning the election on the simple fact that Trump has been so unpopular for the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity also appears to be hurting Republicans in the midterm elections, with many fearful that Democrats could even take control of the US Senate, which has been seen as a long shot.
Politico reported earlier this month that if the election were held now, Republicans would suffer their worst defeat in a generation.
The outer suburbs proved particularly troublesome for the party in the 2016 election, and it appears that trend will continue.
In recent days, Mr. Trump has tried to scare suburban voters into voting for him by warning that if Mr. Biden is elected, he will destroy the suburbs and fan the flames of racial tensions.
He has rolled back an Obama-era rule that sought to increase housing diversity in suburban areas.
He urged "homemakers" across the country to read an op-ed by the former New York deputy governor, in which she argued that Mr. Biden would "eviscerate" suburban America and he agreed.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I will keep it, and maybe even improve on it!" said the President.
As suburbanites, they are a growing voting bloc in the United States.
According to NPR, they make up about half of all voters in the US.
Since 2004, the candidate who has received the most votes from this group has gone on to become president.
Aside from 2012, when Mitt Romney received more votes from this group than Barack Obama, he still lost.
Opinion polls have shown that Mr. Trump's support has been eroding in the suburban areas where he won a narrow majority in 2016.
While the lead has varied in the polls, Biden has been consistently ahead of Trump by about fifteen points in the battleground states.
Regis Philbin dies
US television presenter Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, host, presenter and singer for over six decades.
He is best known for hosting Live! With Regis from 1988 to 2011 alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has also hosted shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
Guinness World Records lists Philbin as the person who has appeared on American television the most, and he has been recognized for that achievement.
He won six Emmy Awards during his career and was nominated a total of 37 times.
According to a statement from his family, Philbin died of natural causes.
The outpouring of grief on social media over the past 24 hours has been overwhelming.
Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision was made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event which has only been postponed twice before, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic torch would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," referring to the global effort to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.
Athletes have an extra year to prepare, and the Japanese authorities are footing the bill for the postponement.
Everyone keeps their heads down, after all, it's touch and go.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan would host this year's Olympics, there was no doubt that the Japanese delegation would be excited.
They wept and laughed together, for Tokyo had bid to host in 2016 but lost out to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan will be in the global spotlight.
The Games were scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed until 23 July 2021, with the opening ceremony starting on 23 July and the closing ceremony on 8 August.
If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen, or if it becomes impossible to hold the Games, they will be canceled.
However, no one wants to think about it too much.
The Olympics are not just another sporting competition.
There's no expense spared, the show has to be spectacular, and they're always trying to top the last Games.
The selection of the host city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation of bids by an evaluation committee.
The bigger the splash, the better the chances of getting noticed.
Tokyo has spent around $150 million in an unsuccessful bid to host the 2016 Olympics, which would have cost around $20 billion.
In the second instance, when it came to bidding for the 2020 games, $75 million, about 10 billion Icelandic krónur, was spent on the presentation.
In 2013, when Tokyo was selected as the host city, the Japanese government had already spent JPY300 billion ($3.5 billion) on preparations for the Games.
However, this amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of building the Olympic Village, sports facilities, and generally strengthening the infrastructure of the country to be able to host such a big event, prepare for it, and hold it.
Organizers in Japan have estimated that the postponed Tokyo Olympics, which had been scheduled to take place this year but has been delayed by one year because of the coronavirus pandemic, will cost $12.6 billion.
In a report released last year by Japan's Office of the Auditor-General, it was found that the true cost was closer to double that amount.
It is likely that the full cost of postponing the Games will never be known, but estimates range from $2 billion to $6 billion above and beyond the original cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could be in the range of $1.5 billion to $3 billion.
It is such a large number that all the tax revenue collected by the Icelandic government would only cover just under half of an Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympics are such a large event that they have frequently been studied by economists, who try to look at the numbers and see the benefits and value of the games.
In short, it appears that a large number of people have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympics is far from positive for the economies of the cities that host them.
There are some short-term benefits, such as a large increase in jobs, but over the long term, cities often find themselves saddled with debt and deferred maintenance for aging infrastructure.
Rio de Janeiro is left with huge debts after the 2016 Olympics, and has struggled to maintain all the large facilities built for the games.
Looking at the numbers from London 2012, it was found that only 10 per cent of those employed in the Olympic jobs in the city were unemployed beforehand.
This means that only a small part of the new jobs were actually created.
In general, cities have not fared well financially from hosting the Olympics, due to the cost overruns associated with the construction of the facilities required to host the games.
However, the benefits are often said to be increased tourist traffic to the Olympic cities after the games, although there is a lot of uncertainty about the 2021 games.
It is also not sure if all the spectators who normally attend the games will be able to do so.
However, the most important aspect is the honour bestowed on the towns to be selected, which is difficult to quantify in monetary terms.
In fact, despite the huge cost, it can also be said that the joy brought by the Games is not of a kind that can be put a price on.
While the exhibition is always luxurious and there are no expenses spared, of course this is not just about money spinning.
It's all about the sport heroes.
For some, postponing the Games is just what the doctor ordered.
Australia's track and field star Chloe Esposito, who won gold in the 400m hurdles at London 2012 and is due to compete in the event again at Tokyo 2021, is expecting her first child.
She is among those athletes who are simply relieved that the Games have been postponed, for obvious reasons.
For those athletes looking to retire after this summer's Games, the postponement will in some cases mean they will be able to go out on top.
Don't underestimate the toll that another year of intense training will take on your body.
Few athletes have ever captured the hearts of the crowd at an Olympic Games like Simone Biles has at Rio 2016.
She returned with four gold medals and one bronze.
Biles has given a number of interviews in her home country of the United States in the lead-up to the Olympics.
She's aiming for Tokyo 2021, but she's far from certain she'll make the cut for next year's Games, when she'll be 24.
While it is not generally considered an old age, it is high for a female gymnast.
"It's a sensitive subject," Biles said with a smile in an Instagram interview with the U.S. Olympic Committee about whether she'll be able to match or exceed her 2016 totals in Tokyo.
"I don't know if I'll be able to come back after a year of training," Biles said.
She has previously spoken about how her body can no longer take the stresses and strains of gymnastics.
However, she is training hard for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles acknowledged that the toll of having to suddenly stop practicing because of the global pandemic and the closure of the gym made her "uncomfortable."
There were no exceptions for Biles, just like there aren't for anyone else during the seven-week period when all athletic facilities are closed.
All her Olympic gold medals have been sold, and she had to find ways to stay in shape just like everyone else.
It is certainly better than most people's, though.
"We have a very tight schedule now.
It was hard to get back into training after the gymnastics facility opened.
We started slowly but are building up again and I will increase the training gradually throughout the year.
Obviously we don't know how these games will go or if they will take place, but we are training as if they will because we can't do anything else.
I've put so much stress on my body to get to this point," Biles said.
With her, as with others, there's this nagging doubt or awareness that the Games might not happen in 2021 after all.
As a matter of fact, it is impossible to predict it.
No-one knows yet how the coronavirus pandemic will have developed by July 2021, so the only sensible thing to do is to prepare for the Olympics as if they will go ahead.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be a beacon at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Postponed wedding due to epidemic
Modern Family star Sarah Hyland has postponed her wedding because of the coronavirus.
She was set to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are bigger things to worry about right now," the actress told People.
"We would really like to get married at some point and have our dream wedding with all our loved ones around us.
We decided to hold off on that for now and focus on what's important right now which is helping share information about the importance of masks and staying home.
I'm more focused on world issues than on wedding issues at the moment.
There are a lot of things going on and we should focus on what's going on in the world."
