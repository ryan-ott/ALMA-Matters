In my view, the literature programme was developed by women of a certain age, based on their interests.
From 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote feuilletons, of course, from the point of view of those same women of a certain age.
But the psychology and suffering of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines are not so interesting for teenagers.
In general, adolescents are not interested in the psychology of the heroes.
Thank you so much, it's really interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige, 105x195.
The "Prestige Micro-Pack" model: comfort and natural ingredients.
The mattress has different firmness on both sides: the medium-firm surface is made of latex coconut fibre and natural latex, and the medium-soft surface is made of natural latex foam.
The springy block with 1000 springs per square metre quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the effect of ‘waves’ or ‘hammock’.
The model's key features include breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, naturally ventilates as well as coir.
This keeps the sleeping area at a healthy temperature.
The mattress also has an extended warranty period.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the lifespan of a mattress is longer.
A removable cotton cover is provided to protect against dust and dirt.
Accompany your mattress with an orthopaedic pillow - they are recommended to support the natural curvature of your spine while you sleep.
The filling determines the purpose of the mattress - coconut provides support for the spine, while latex relaxes the muscles.

I try not to go overboard with the spread for my family.
I cook for them, and I bake often just for the fun of it.
Germany: Fourth Covid vaccine dose 'inevitable'
A fourth vaccination will be needed in summer or autumn 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, it is unlikely that two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will be enough to provide full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Wiegel, is convinced of this.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, 11 December.
We are expecting that a fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn’, says the expert.
In addition, Weygandt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, booster vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new Covid-19 variant "Omicron".
In particular, the new variant is particularly dangerous.
As such, the risk of reinfection from the Omicron variant is three times that of the Delta or Beta variants.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
As such, by March 2022, the manufacturers of BioNTech/Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted to the Omikron variant.
The companies stress that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new "Omicron" variant of the coronavirus.
BioNTech and Pfizer's study showed that the efficacy was significantly lower at two doses: "the neutralizing potential was reduced by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron variant," said BioNTech and Pfizer.
That's why we need a third dose.
Experts are urging the acceleration of the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of reducing the time between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, as Salzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta and omicron variants of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience is very convincing in this regard”, the expert stressed.
Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g
The Bet-A-Vib series is a unique branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (along with the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibratory lures in that it was designed specifically for ice fishing and not just general fishing.
These vibrations have more weight than their close-sized counterparts, which definitely has a positive effect on the application of these interesting baits.
The other obvious feature is the top fin, which is made from a tough, flexible plastic that adds extra vibration when vertical and horizontal presentations are made.
As a 'winter vibe', Bet-A-Vib performs very aggressively on the retrieve.
It is often the case that the most effective is the simplest, monotonous animation, i.e. the movement of the rod up and down with almost no pauses.
In planning, the deviation from the vertical is not too large, which is convenient for fishing in a limited space, with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles that can get hung up on.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant for catching pike and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a precise and aggressive presentation of the bait is required.
Reaching the end of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly rotates and returns to its original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is just as effective for ice fishing for rainbow trout.
To please her whims, there are two versions to choose from: with a sound capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It was also noted that the Bet-A-Vib can attract a passive fish that doesn't even react to a live bait.
The Bet-A-Vib casts like no other.
It is easy to understand and not fussy, it combines well with both monofilament and braided lines, even of large diameters.
For throwing fishing, pike, perch or roach, in addition to the steady current, the "step" and sometimes the "clatter" on the bottom are effective.
In areas with heavy weed, it is possible to change the front tube to a doubletube, which will reduce the chance of snagging.
The Bet-A-Vib is one of the most durable and effective lures in its class, and as a result, one of the most productive.
It can be used with equal success in relatively shallow and very deep water.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

Libya claims 7,000 Russian mercenaries
In Libya, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) Wagner.
This was announced by the head of the Supreme Council of the Republic, Khalid al-Mishri, on Sunday, December 12.
“Currently, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company, Wagner, in Libya.
They have aircraft as well.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at Garbia airbase (which is also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also indicated that the Russian mercenaries are "trying to occupy" central Libya, which stretches from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Presence
According to the publication's source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and ‘moved into Libya’.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and a port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Juft, the agency noted.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the mercenary group Wagner is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else might mercenaries be?
According to the agency, Wagner is suspected of operating in nine African countries - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides training for the local forces, bodyguards for local leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Vagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of mineral and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies, and military services to these countries", the article states.
According to the media, the "Wagner Group" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic.
This group is not registered in the military or in the registry of legal entities, and its fighters are not listed in the service rolls.
This company is under US sanctions.
To recall, earlier, the ambassadors of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
This decision is expected to be confirmed by the European Union Council on December 13.
Situation in Libya
The Higher State Council of Libya, in de facto, is a second chamber of parliament with advisory functions dominated by Islamists, TASS reported.
This body has repeatedly called for moving the date of the parliamentary and presidential elections from 24 December to at least February 2022.
“With less than two weeks until the election, the chances of it being held on time are rapidly decreasing”, the report notes.
In this context, the Higher Election Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Russia's foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country’s foreign policy, while 29% consider that failures predominate.
“Examples of success – ‘in Syria, we defended and restored peace there’, ‘the “Nord Stream 2” decision’, ‘the whole world was intimidated by advanced weaponry’, ‘we squeezed Crimea’.
The main failures were ‘the conflict with Ukraine’, ‘confrontation with western countries’, and ‘isolation from the world’, the study by the ‘Public Opinion Foundation’ states.
Dubai's government has completely eliminated paperwork - all government services are now digital
Dubai's government announced a complete shift away from paper-based processes and towards digital technology.
All state services will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
The Emirates News Agency WAM reported this.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase in Dubai's digital transformation - we have completed the transition to a paperless government," Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai Executive Council, said on Saturday.
Now, the internal and external document flow in all Dubai government entities will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The new initiative has affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, the police, municipal authorities, courts, and so on. Many commercial structures have also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitization of document flow started in Dubai in 2018.
Over that time, it is estimated that 336 million sheets of paper have been saved, which equates to 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, so, about the date of birth and how old the child is, this is already madness, and about the class and group in the kindergarten too.

These people knew for sure that there was someone at home...
Turkish car production and exports fell below 2020 levels
Production and exports of cars in Turkey fell sharply in November amid the devaluation of the lira.
According to Bloomberg, the results of the automotive industry for the 11 months of the year were worse than last year's figures, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Industry Association.
According to the association’s data, 115,000 vehicles were produced in Turkey in November, which is 20% lower than the previous year.
Some 75,900 vehicles were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year’s figure.
And if, as a result of the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish automotive sector demonstrated a positive dynamic compared to the previous year, then, as a result of the 11 months of 2021, the output of cars was already 0.3% lower than the previous year's figure.
The fall was caused by a sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira, which fell by 29% in relation to the dollar in November.
This resulted in a fall in economic activity across all sectors.
More than 500 small and medium-sized businesses received deferrals on credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation with providing subsidies to small and medium-sized businesses, reports a correspondent for MIA “Kazinform”.
“According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of Financial Markets, in accordance with the instructions of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency of April 9, 2021 No. 127 “On approval of the procedure for granting deferrals on loan repayments to small and medium-sized businesses” was adopted, wrote Alikhan Smailov in his response to the deputy’s inquiry.
He reminded that the procedure for granting deferrals of loan payments stipulated that lending institutions and microfinance organizations would grant deferrals of loan payments to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, for loans issued before April 1, 2021, for a period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The postponement period ranged from 30 to 90 days, depending on the choice of the SME.
In the borrower’s statement, the postponement period could have been indicated.
During the period of deferment for the borrower, the creditor’s pre-court and court claims, as well as notifications about the need to repay overdue debt, and the charging of fees and other payments were suspended’, the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
In 2021, 603 SME borrowers submitted requests for loan repayment deferrals to second-tier banks, of which 553 SME borrowers received loan repayment deferrals in the amount of KZT 9.7 billion.
There were 131 applicants from the SME sector, of which 95 were granted a deferment for a total of KZT 105.8 million’, concluded A. Smagov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with a weak immune system can easily cope with the "Omicron" strain
The doctor speculated that people with weakened immune systems might fare better than those with strong immune systems
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the "Omicron" coronavirus strain could be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions under which the virus emerged.
Scientists believe that Omicron originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunocompromised individual.
In other words, the mutation was not resisted by the immune system.
This makes him more aggressive.
The fact that there was no answer from the immune system made it very fast.
Apparently, there are more of these spike proteins there, maybe more than should be, and their antibodies were not cut during the mutations, commented the pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems might fare better against "omicron" than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that the body's strong response to something, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can literally kill itself.
This is how it is with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die, and elderly people in their 60s carry it off with a cough.
The immune response in young people is wild, it’s completely inappropriate: instead of just wagging their fingers, they shoot like a cannon at a swarm of sparrows, concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the worst of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is dealt with very successfully and quickly, in the second case, symptoms can often only be dealt with – all hope is placed in the body.
The first sign of a developing pneumonia is the onset of intoxication of the body – this is indicated by fever, weakness, and general malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, a feeling of constriction in the chest, coughing.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also be signs of a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, vaccination of the younger generation, from 12 to 18 years of age, may begin before the end of the year.
Pavel Volchkov, a virolog and head of the Laboratory of Genomic Engineering at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, noted that this group is very susceptible to COVID-19.
For teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is maximized.
This is the most socially active layer, just like pre-school children, said Pavel Volchkov, virologist and head of the Laboratory of Genomic Engineering at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) to Moscow 24.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.
I enjoyed reminiscing...
Teath-in.
In those distant 1970s-1980s, no dance floor was complete without the music of this group.

Immunologists speculate as to why obese people become Covid-19 victims
The researchers studied the fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells in the fat tissue, the macrophages, were also infected, and they showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
The scientists also studied the fat tissue of Covid-19 patients who had died and found particles of coronavirus in the fat surrounding certain organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir to evade the immune system.
SARS-CoV-2 may also be capable of this.
A biologist spoke about the causes of dementia
PhD in Biology, Semyon Golosheikin, spoke about the causes of dementia and ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive function – in time, the person has difficulty orienting themselves even in familiar surroundings.
Goloshekin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase your risk of getting the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
On the behavioural level, there can be a role for such factors as social isolation and the lack of meaningful cognitive activity’, he said.
Lifestyle factors such as smoking, excessive drinking, irregular sleep habits, and inactivity also contribute to the development of dementia.
The expert noted that among the first signs were forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in abstract thinking.
“There is a discussion that hearing loss may be an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease, or one of the risk factors”, the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt has returned around 30,000 artefacts illegally removed from the country
In the last 10 years, the Egyptian government has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artefacts that had been illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, on Al-Hayat TV by Shaaban Abdel Gawad, the chief inspector of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.
Egypt has managed to recover 29,300 artefacts since 2011.
This year alone, 5,300 ancient Egyptian artifacts have been discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gaouad clarified that all the artefacts smuggled out of the country are registered in the archives.
The department's staff is currently working on their repatriation to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "monitor auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that after its return, the cultural relics will be restored and then put on display in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artefacts was the ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities approached Interpol to help find a bust of King Tutankhamun which had been sold at auction in London.
On July 4, auction house Christie's held an auction, at which a 3,000-year-old bust was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused irritation in Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artefact was illegally removed from the Luxor Temple in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as a god of the sun Amon, had been in a private collection and had not been on public display since 1985.
It is not known how the relic came to Europe.
In recent years, Egypt has actively pursued the repatriation of artefacts that were illegally removed from the country at various times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled artefacts is the result of the activities of the ‘black diggers’.
“Crimean Tatars are not taken into account” – and this is correct, because Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a distinct people (similar to Turks).
If you want to increase, then only 42 thousand people – that’s how many Tatars (in Kazan) live in Crimea (according to the census).
Crimean Tatars are a distinct nation, and the name of that nation consists of two words!
The only thing uniting them is the Turkish language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees" mobile devices
Credit Suisse is requiring its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, Financial Times reported.
The reason is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees; instead, it offers a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner – a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, banks can monitor the activity of corporate devices issued to their staff as they are used for business purposes - communicating with colleagues or customers.
The bank only uses device searches as a last resort, for example if an employee used a device to meet a client without approval from Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees are working remotely, the bank wants to apply that policy to any device used to do work.
According to the newspaper, management set a deadline for employees to familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse declined to comment officially on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin’s life, 1925, was fruitful in terms of his creativity, but extremely difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his “ego”.
He is no longer affiliated with any literary circles, he has distanced himself from imaginism, he is an outsider, but well-known, in demand, sometimes severely criticized by critics, even viciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their shoulders.
Over the course of a year, more than 60 poems were written, many of which are real masterpieces, the cycle “Persian Motifs” was completed, the poem “Anna Snegina” was written, and 8 books were published, including the anthology “Soviet Russia”.
The main success was in the late June of 1925, when Gosizdat signed a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No contemporary poet has ever received such an honour from Sergey Aleksandrovich, he is the first!
In addition, this promised very good money – under the terms of the contract, the monthly fee was 1,000 rubles for 20 months (the plant director, for example, received 300 rubles a month, an engineer – 200).
The funds were needed more than ever that year.
Esenin married Lev Tolstoy's great-granddaughter, Sofya Tolstaya. It was necessary to arrange the domestic life, to support the sisters Katya and Sasha, and also the mother.
It seems that life was getting better, there was something to be happy about, but everything was tinged with darkness, as if a nightmare from the poem “The Black Man” (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Esenin):
My friend, my friend.
I'm very, very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
It's blowing like crazy out there.
Above a desolate, treeless field.
It's as if they're planting a grove in September.
It's alcohol that clouds your judgement.
Many of his acquaintances noted that, in their opinion, Esenin had significantly deteriorated, looked very poorly, and was obviously ill.
Frequent failures and nervous breakdowns are becoming more common.
And the reason, most likely, is not only about alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis – alcoholism – was ever given to Sergey Aleksandrovich, there are no verifiable documents left.
For example, from May 1923, when, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, he was recovering his health in a clinic in Paris, under the supervision of Professor P. Gannushkin (two years later, he would return to this clinic in Moscow).
However, there are plenty of eyewitness accounts of the poet’s binges, scandals, and arrests, strewn across dozens of memoirs.
At the beginning of the 1920s, the terrible romance between the poet and the green serpent developed rapidly.
At the end of summer 1923, in for a short time, Esenin lived with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
It's surprising, but, despite his very good income, Yessenin never had his own flat in Moscow or St. Petersburg; he lived in rented flats, in hotels, or with friends.
Starcev recalled:
He would only stay overnight, and in the majority of cases, was in an inebriated state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the stair landing...
He fell and scraped his face, and let out a high-pitched scream.
Coming to his senses, he began to cough uncontrollably, spraying blood over everything on his bed..."
And, in fact, after his tour of Europe and the United States (there was a prohibition in the United States at that time, but Duncan brought a large supply of alcohol with her), Yevgeny Esenin himself confessed:
"I didn't see anything there, except for taverns and streets...
I'm already at the end and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, he did drink, of course...
I drank because I was miserable."

Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195 mattress
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom – a modern interpretation of a budget model in a premium class line.
The base of the mattress is a block of two independent double springs, Duet.
There is a softer spring inside the larger spring.
This allows the load to be distributed evenly across the mattress.
On both sides, the mattress is filled with artificial latex.
It is a kind of natural latex, but denser and cheaper.
The flexibility and resilience of this material enhance the comfort of the mattress.
The artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it doesn't absorb moisture or dust.
The mattress is perfect for a couple with a big weight difference (from 30 kilograms).
Here, the "smart" springs mean that there is no roll-over effect, where the lightweight partner slides to the side of the heavy one.
This is a pleasant, soft-to-the-touch cover, made from a practical jacquard fabric, with a layer of synthetic padding sewn in.
Natural fabrics do not collect static electricity.
This mattress may be produced in a rolled-up format (vacuum packed).
Now, my son is almost 16 years old, and he no longer torments the desire to fool around.
All their energy is focused on choosing what they will do to make a living.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had problems with the law from time to time, right up to the wedding.
The father cares for his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, ‘with a strange love’.
Why did the girl cry on the exam, when she hadn't even failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't a school.
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
It's a do-over.
This is common knowledge for millions of students.

Poland’s Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as a ‘weapon’ against the EU
Poland’s Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as a ‘weapon’
The Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland, Pawel Jabłoński, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union, and intends to return to this "operation" next year.
The statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus “temporarily stopped Lukašenko”, but he is “actively looking for new ways”.
Also, the Polish official is sure that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon ‘in many parts of the world’.
As the kp.ru site wrote earlier, the European Union imposed a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It mentions 17 individuals and 11 entities.
In Europe, they announced their readiness to continue to expand the restrictive measures against the republic, “if the situation in the country doesn’t improve”.
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously taken the decision to impose sanctions against Belarus.

‘Not by Sanya’: when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughing stock
In 2021, velvet blazers dominated the social scene.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion choice was Daniel Craig.
In September, he appeared at the premiere of the film “No Time to Die”, wearing a velvet burgundy jacket and the traditional “Bond girl” dress.
He was followed twice by Prince William, who first donned an inappropriate green velvet jacket for the Earthshot Prize ceremony, and then opted for a more traditional option for the Royal Variety Performance.
Lionel Messi tried on the trend a couple of weeks ago.
The footballer arrived to collect his seventh ‘Golden Ball’, wearing a Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for velvet men’s suits in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, as reported to Gazeta.Ru, they have become 1.4 times more popular.
The most popular styles are warm, velvet blazers with padding and a fitted silhouette, and the main colours are beige, burgundy, navy, and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. However, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets – suits with velvet trousers they choose less often.
They can be purchased not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet blazers are featured by almost all brands this season – Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent, to name a few.
The most coveted is the Gucci model, in which the ambassador of the brand, Jared Leto, appeared at one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci".
When choosing a jacket from a luxury brand, you can be sure that the velvet is made from silk.
The special weaving technique results in a dense fabric with a fuzzy outer texture and a smooth inner side.
More affordable options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they tend to be less durable.
Fashion expert for Lamoda, Ilya Vakhonsky, warns that with a velvet jacket, the most important thing is not the model or style, but the appropriateness.
‘Baroque demands evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you’re going to a cocktail party or a formal event’, Vakhonsky explains. ‘It will also work with a ‘Black Tie’ or ‘Creative Black Tie’ invitation’.
The other important criterion, which makes it possible to choose a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
‘A man in a velvet jacket, first and foremost, must acquire a proper advanced social circle with disposable income’, the authors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion, ‘Krasavchik Brammell’, believe. The wearers of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the group of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to formal social events where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhonsky suggests pairing a velvet blazer with similar formal wear: classic trousers with pleats, solid shirts, silk ties, loafers with bows, cufflinks.
Things that are too basic and mundane will look out of place.
The fashion experts from “Bramhall’s Beauties” are sure that it would be inappropriate for a regular employee to appear at a corporate event in a velvet jacket, but if we’re talking about the “boss of all bosses”, then it’s a “yes”.
If you're a lower-level employee looking to move up the corporate ladder or earn a bonus, it's best to avoid wearing a velvet blazer.
The editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion are sure that the management will appreciate this with the phrase ‘not for Semyonov’s head’.
Very mixed feelings about the voice.
It's not natural, it's forced, it drags.
And it has nothing to do with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I do not understand the admiration of those around me.
But, from the bottom of my heart, I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money: alternative energy is well-lobbied, in other words, it is paid for.
Billion dollar investment.
Are they sad?
No, electricity prices have gone up.
Traditional energy sources are also not in short supply – and gas, oil, and coal were purchased at a lower price than is currently being offered.
There is a huge demand for fuel.
It drops a kopeck at a time.
Who's left in the air?
A regular shopper, as usual.
Isn't the sheriff's problem the Indians?
Therefore, it would be wrong to assume that Western politicians are idiots who have ‘missed’ the energy crisis.
They've done a great job.
For good pay.
I couldn't find a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
It's just mediocrity for the average traveller.
Maybe if these characters are so sure of their beauty that they feel the need to broadcast it to the entire carriage, they won't sit down next to them.
However, it is only because of mental illness and ignorance of such ‘beauties’, but not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a person who recognizes his slave status and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who does not know that he is a slave, and who wallow in a dumb, unconscious, and speechless life of slavery, is simply a slave.
A slave who drools with pleasure at the thought of the joys of slavery and the benevolence of his master is a minion, an upstart."
An immunologist stated that revaccination every 4-5 months will help to protect against the ‘Omicron’ COVID-19 strain
Revaccination every four to five months can protect against the new coronavirus "Omicron" variant.
The statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the six-month interval, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, ‘a very long period’
“In the past, such a period was normal, but now it is best to perform the procedure after five months, and people with chronic illnesses – after four”, the expert said, calling on the simultaneous vaccination and revaccination campaign.
Kruchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good level of neutralizing antibodies.
‘If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or if they have had Covid-19 and have been vaccinated, or if they have been vaccinated and have had Covid-19, then they have a ‘hybrid immunity’, i.e. there are a lot of antibodies and they are able to neutralise the virus’, the expert clarified.
The "Big Seven" has warned Russia about the "far-reaching consequences" of an invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France, and Japan) published a statement after the meeting of the foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that the "military aggression" of Russia against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly", but it does not describe specific measures.
“We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine”, the statement said.
Next, the ministers urge Russia to “de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and comply with its international obligations regarding the transparency of its military activities”, which President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
“We confirm our support for France and Germany’s efforts in the Normandy format to fully implement the Minsk Agreement to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, the foreign ministers of the “Big Seven” also stated.
Any use of force to change the borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and serious costs in response’, they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will step up our cooperation in providing a joint and comprehensive response," the statement added.
Earlier in the day, the British foreign secretary Elizabeth Truss said that Russia will face "significant consequences" if it invades Ukraine.
She said that this meeting showed the "clear voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which have made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine 32 times less effective against Omicron variant - study
The efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine against the Omicron strain is 32 times lower than that of other types of disease.
Researchers from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reports.
The vaccine was found to be less effective in preventing Covid-19 in a study that looked at the antibody responses of people who had received two doses of the jab.
"We see that most people have had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2, but this has been significantly reduced against the Omicron variant," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against a severe course of the disease in case of coronavirus infection.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain.
The authors of the study have concluded that the Omicron variant may cause a new wave of viral circulation and increased mortality unless additional measures are taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking the delivery of NATO weapons to Kyiv
Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Ukraine’s acquisition of lethal weapons under the NATO umbrella.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that, last month, Germany vetoed a Ukrainian procurement of anti-sniper systems and assault rifles to defeat drones.
However, it was noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defence minister, Kiev is determined to acquire the aforementioned weapons as part of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the stance of the new German government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, on the issue of supplying arms to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev shouldn’t expect deliveries of weapons from Berlin with Chancellor Scholz at the helm.
In his words, the previous German government explained its refusal to supply weapons by the risk of escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the ‘occupation of part of the Ukrainian territory by Russia’.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will maintain the same “illogical” position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Kyiv was expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping its navy.
Ukraine expects Germany "to be a partner to Ukraine in a technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that, earlier this year, co-chair of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke in favour of the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

It was.
Of course, the project, the approval, the new technical passport, everything by the law.
In the entrance hall, they made a bookshelf and a large wardrobe.
The door to the kitchen was blocked, so there was a pile of space.
Over almost 10 years of living in this flat, we haven't once regretted our decision.
A mistake was made: instead of a bath, they installed a sleek shower cubicle.
I regret it a thousand times!

Additionally, paint and other chemicals will keep the birds away.
Only natural materials and natural colours.
Thanks, I'll definitely try it.
So, what's Japan got to do with it?
Thanks for the recipe.
What varieties of apples should I use for this recipe?
It's really good.
I add some chopped red onion and a green apple.
Try it.

I feel sorry for her, she lived her life in anger.

G7 warns Russia of consequences of invading Ukraine
Foreign ministers of the G7 have warned that there will be "significant consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the escalation of the Russian military presence near the country's borders.
"It should be clear to Russia that any further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," the statement published on the British government website said.
The G7 ministers and the EU representative noted that they "stand united in their condemnation of the Russian military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine."
Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss, speaking in Liverpool, warned of "significant consequences" for Russia if it invaded Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any violation will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to renounce aggression against Ukraine’, she said (quote from TASS).
Earlier at the G7 summit in Liverpool, the foreign ministers of the G7 agreed that the parties to the conflict should return to the negotiating table in order to resolve the crisis stemming from the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.
It was about negotiations in the “Normandy format”.
The North Atlantic alliance also took part in the dialogue on Ukraine in the “Normandy format”.
Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, stated that, by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries ‘have sealed their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes’.

Methods revealed for recovering stolen money from online stores
There are several ways to get your money back from an online shopping scam and avoid becoming a victim in the future.
This was revealed by information security experts in conversation with RBK.
For example, to reduce the risk of large losses due to the theft of bank card data, it is recommended to store the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used for online shopping.
Some savings can be put into a fixed deposit and withdrawn as and when required.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online shopping.
If the money was stolen from purchases made in stores that do not use 3D Secure technology, it is possible to initiate a refund process.
“In accordance with the rules set by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, liability falls on the party in the payment chain who does not use this service”, a spokesperson for Promsvyazbank clarified.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, stressed that the buyer has the right to lodge a complaint with the bank within 120 days of the purchase, in order to contest the fraudulent transaction.
In addition, if the fraudster used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves refund the money to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Ekaterina Miuzilina, a member of the Public Chamber and director of the League of Safe Internet, reported that, in 2021 alone, there were 11,000 complaints about various types of fraud, ranging from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
In her words, the most effective solution in the current situation could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine, and the situation with the Nord Stream 2 Russian gas pipeline.
Although Scholz stated that he is committed to maintaining good relations between Germany and Poland for years to come, the leaders of the two countries expressed their explicit expectations of one another.
Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki stated that he would be calling on Scholz to speak out against Nord Stream 2, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany via Ukraine.
In Morawecki's view, Russia could use the gas pipeline to exert political pressure on Europe.
Germany, in turn, has supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to get into the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
However, Poland's judicial system remains one of the points of contention.
The European Court has fined Poland for violating EU law, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party have infringed EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation prevails over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not taken on the public commitment to stop the operation of Nord Stream 2 in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told congressional members that they have reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. official said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violates the Ukrainian border, which was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the "Big Seven".
Dmitry, pay more attention.
It's the same view, the same window.

I know very well apartments like this, and I can see very well how they have been redeveloped.
Let it be good for them.
It always surprises me when people write about cleaning products for cleaning a sink, a toilet, a window sill, a faucet.
You wash them once a year at Easter, so you have to really wash them.
Just don't let yourself get dirty.
Mincyfry wants to reward writers with residences
The government will transfer federal property left by the Writers' Union of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR to the future Foundation to support Russian writers.
The basis will be used to create writer’s residences, reported Parlamentskaya Gazeta, which will become the foundation’s founder.
The Ministry of Digital Development and Communications is preparing a draft presidential decree on the creation of a fund to support Russian writers.
The explanatory memo clarifies that the foundation will be entrusted with caring for, among other things, the targeted use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Writers’ Union of the Soviet Union and the Literary Fund.
“A significant number of immovable property previously belonging to the Literary Fund of the USSR has come into the ownership of the Russian Federation, including properties located in the Writers’ Village in Perdelkino, and in Komarovo in Leningrad Oblast, and others”, the press service of the Ministry of Science and Technology told Parlamentskaya Gazeta.
The project of the decree stipulates that the charter of the Foundation should reflect that it "is created in order to facilitate literary activity by providing the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers".
“Under ‘creating conditions for creative activity’, we mean creating writer’s residencies in different regions of Russia on the basis of the property being transferred, which would provide a comfortable environment for creativity”, the Ministry of Digital Development and Communications explained to our publication.

A cheese bun is, in a literal sense, a piece of dough from a pack costing RUB 550.

It seems that on Belorusskaya there are only rich people.
Doctors warn against long-term use of blood-thinners after Covid-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned about the danger of the uncontrolled use of blood-thinning drugs after coronavirus infection COVID-19 and before vaccination against coronavirus.
Irina Yartseva, an infectious disease specialist and immunologist, said that independent prevention of possible thrombosis after COVID-19 could cause a stroke.
Yartseva explained that the blood-thinning drugs are not for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in hospital, and had complications.
A doctor will prescribe anticoagulants (blood-thinning medication that prevents the formation of excessive clots) as needed.
She reported that there is a lot of superstition at the moment – everyone is taking anti-coagulants for a long time, and as a result, there are complications in the form of haemorrhagic strokes (blood clots in the brain).

According to Dr Tokarev, people believe in dubious advice on the Internet and start to treat themselves.
There are people who, of their own volition, start to take anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And during the pre-injection check-up, doctors notice bruising.
He stressed that it was extremely dangerous to take any medication without first determining the cause of a particular symptom.
Potatoes named superfood to protect against hypertension
Studies have shown that regular consumption of this common and inexpensive vegetable significantly reduces the risk of developing diseases of the cardiovascular system.
Potatoes are a staple in every kitchen, and have amazing properties.
The product is rich in vitamins and microelements that contribute to the work of the internal organs.

I have had that experience.
A lady has come to look at an apartment.
I came from another city to show her.
The announcement had detailed photos and description of the apartment.
She was left very disappointed as there was no "fancy" kitchen or "fancy" balcony.
It seems that this woman has nothing to do, so she is looking at other people’s flats, and people are wasting their time.
Some 145,000 teenagers have had their first COVID-19 vaccine in Kazakhstan
Information about the vaccination of adolescents, pregnant and nursing women against coronavirus in Kazakhstan has been published, reports MIA Kazinform with reference to the COVID-19 Prevention and Control Commission.

The plumber who found money in the church wall will be paid 20,000 dollars
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be paid the reward.
This was reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident happened at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians will be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021 plumber Justin Cole was renovating one of the church's toilets and found thousands of envelopes stuffed with cash and cheques behind the insulation.
He turned it over to the church, and he said that he didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "you know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you've done and what you could do," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
It appears that the find is connected to a theft that occurred at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then, about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks were stolen from the church's safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, a reward of USD 25,000 was announced for information about the criminals.
As such, Mr. Coe could not have been awarded that amount, as the period of eligibility for the prize had expired.
However, the non-profit Crime Stoppers of Houston, which initially offered a $5,000 reward and later received $20,000 in donations from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier, it was reported that the police had questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions – this is her character trait of ‘being a real person’.
That's why the attitude towards her is so negative.
It has nothing to do with the fact that “she is financially much richer than all the other rappers”, as they write here.
There are richer people, but not all of them behave with such impudence and arrogance as this madame.

China reports a new case of human infection with bird flu virus
A new case of human infection with a highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N6) virus has been reported in China.
RTHK radio station reported this, citing a notification from the Hong Kong health authorities, TASS reported.
The patient, a 68-year-old resident of Huizhou in Guangdong province, who kept poultry, has been confirmed to have been infected with the virus.
It is in critical condition.
The first human infection by the H5N6 strain was reported in May 2014 in southwest Sichuan province.
Since then, there have been 53 such cases in the country.
In Brazil, citizens are now required to show vaccination certificates upon entering the country
In Brazil, a judge from the Federal Supreme Court (STF), Luis Roberto Barroso, ordered that Covid-19 passports be requested from those entering the country.
This was reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who are exempted from mandatory vaccination because of medical contraindications are not required to present a vaccination certificate.
Individuals arriving from countries where vaccines are proven not to exist are also exempt from the requirement.
“The situation is even more serious when you take into account that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s, pre-Carnaval and Carnaval celebrations, and other events, which will increase tourist flows”, said Barroso.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
The full protection scheme from COVID-19 has been revealed
In a conversation with Ura.ru, the virologist, doctor of medical sciences, and honored scientist of Russia, Anatoly Altstein, revealed a scheme for full protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and using a nasal vaccine.
With intranasal administration, there is a large amount of immunoglobulin A formed. This does not happen with the injection of the vaccine.
The immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot get into the body.
Inside, after vaccination, we get the most amount of immunoglobulin G (antibodies).
And if you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet about the double vaccination’, the medic said.
Sergey Tokarev, chief physician for the Ural Federal District and a doctor of medical sciences, in turn, stated that the main benefit of using a nasal vaccine in conjunction with an injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help the body's defences to be at their peak in such cases.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new wave of COVID-19.
According to him, this is exactly what is happening in other countries that were hit by the next wave of the pandemic earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I spoke to the male (long dead) like this – if you are ready to swap a warm home, feeding, cuddles, love and play for a bitch in season, then go ahead.
However, Pesel was trained and, in general, a smartie.
He chose my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
It wasn't plucked from the sky, believe me.
I slowed down many owners so that they didn’t run after the dog, even though they thought that there, 200,000 are running away (pomskis), I literally grabbed their hands and led them in another direction.
As a result, ‘200,000’ chose its owner, and not the dog that was running somewhere.
Protests against vaccination continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They have expressed dismay at the restrictions and plans to make vaccination against Covid-19 mandatory.
As of February next year, those who have not been vaccinated will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spain saw a peaceful march in Madrid against the government's policies in the health sector.
Some were holding up signs that said, "It's a false pandemic," "I won't take the vaccine."
A major protest against the sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the COVID certificate is mandatory to access bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, retirement homes and night-time leisure facilities.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of a number of regions of the country amidst a rise in the number of coronavirus infections.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters marched against the tightening of restrictions and QR codes.
The rally started peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officials.
A group of protesters threw rocks at police officers.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus about him.
Kashshikova-Rudneva is also indicated as ‘the first Russian doctor of medicine’, probably because she started her studies earlier.
Let's not argue, I think they both deserve it.
However, I agree with Zakharova in one thing: the Americans only brought death and looting to any country they appeared in.

WHO has detected "omicron" in over 60 countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new COVID-19 variant "Omicron" has been detected in 63 countries.
Some experts are already saying that the spread of the new variant could have catastrophic consequences.
The World Health Organization reported on the spread of the strain.
According to the organisation's data, the strain has been detected in 63 countries as of 9 December, in all six regions of the WHO.
This is despite the fact that it only started actively spreading at the end of November.
WHO has also expressed its concern about the high rates of transmission of the new variant.
The WHO experts are concerned that the new strain could be more contagious than the "delta" variant, also known as the Indian variant, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, stated that the Omicron variant could have a significant impact on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Similar conclusions have been drawn in the UK.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will displace "delta" in the coming months.
In the UK alone, the number of infections is expected to reach around 1 million. This is despite the fact that several hundred and up to 10,000 official cases of the omicron variant have been reported in the country.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omicron" strain, and up to 2,000 people a day will be hospitalized at the peak.
The NHS is not going to be able to cope with that.
The situation is exacerbated by the fact that, according to the latest studies, the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower than against the rest of the disease.
We still don't know how the Russian "Sputnik V" vaccine will react to the "Omicron" variant - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine against the "Omicron" strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of ageing?

Interesting Belochka, you are right, online communication is quite different, it is easy and unrestrained, and there is nothing to say in person.
And in person, you see the person, and it’s not what you expected, and it doesn’t really grab you, and that’s where the attitude comes from.
When he meets the right person, his outlook will change.
And again, the Soviet era is called ‘a time of demons’.
Back then, people believed in God a lot more sincerely than they do now.
Yes, and they were brought up according to God’s laws (love your neighbour, don’t steal, etc.).
Today, the ideology is: money at any cost.
There is little faith left for charlatans like Globa, but even if there was, then the time of the devil arrived in the 1990s...
Our Petersburg, that is, Leningrad communalka with Bolshaya Zeleniye maintains communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to keep the warm feelings of the older generation alive.

Lara Angelova, drop it!
The human offspring, especially the male ones, are strong, agile, energetic, boisterous, pushing, fighting, scuffling just like their little "brothers" and "sisters" in the wild!
It's a shame that they're not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps and scratches are common, and they don't bounce like a boomerang!
And for what?
Did you push your brother, not considering his strength?
So, you're always so agile that you never accidentally bump into anyone and you haven't hurt yourself at all?

$135 billion went into apps – Hi-Tech
In 2021, worldwide consumer spending in apps grew by 25%, and downloads by 8%.
The most popular ones in the world were various video services.
CapCut, a video editor, was the most-downloaded app, and YouTube was the top spending app.
Downloads of apps and user spending in them have shown significant growth during the period from January to November 2021.
Downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. Spending by users also grew significantly: by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
This was reported by the analytical company App Annie, which published a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the world economy emerged from lockdown and began a post-pandemic recovery.
“Will the ‘return to physical’ growth slow down the economy of apps? Not at all”, the authors of the report believe.
Leading in terms of downloads was India, with about 20% of all downloads.
Followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS devices still spent more than Android users: 65% of all spending in apps was on iOS.
Among apps, CapCut video editor took first place in terms of downloads in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps: video streaming app MX TakaTak and online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 for downloads.
In general, if we judge by the number of downloads, VPN services (there are two in the top 10: VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and video-related services (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, there are two more services in the top 10: Moj and SnackVideo) are popular among users.
"Users spent the most time in live video and streaming apps," the report's authors said.
Leading the way is YouTube, with TikTok, video streaming services Disney+ and HBO Max, and the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma also in the top five spenders.
The first places in terms of the number of monthly active users are taken by Telegram, Instagram, Zoom, and TikTok, and the top five is rounded out by the mobile version of Microsoft Office.
In Russia, AliExpress shopping app was the leader by the number of downloads in a year.
Followed by Zenly, which shows the location of friends, and CapCut.
Other apps in the top 10 include: StarMaker, an online karaoke app; Shein, an online clothing retailer; Maps for Minecraft PE, an online taxi booking service; Pure Tuber, a YouTube client; Dixy, an online shopping app; and Samokat, an online shopping mall.
People are adapting to the pandemic worldwide by moving to a mobile-first mindset, which is one of the big takeaways.
The most successful industries were those that helped people connect virtually and in-person," said Lexi Siddow, Director of App Annie's Advertiser Intelligence, commenting on the results of the report.
The revenue of the mobile gaming sector in 2021 amounted to $90 billion. The leaders in terms of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, which do not have or almost do not have a storyline, and the video format is minimal.
In the top 3 most popular games in the world were Count Masters, Project Makeover, and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the most popular games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls, and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie released its forecast for 2022.
Among the key trends for next year, the company's analysts have named the growth in the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the rise in popularity of financial apps among Generation Z, such as the Robinhood investment app, as well as continued growth in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warned about a new scam
Thieves are looking for new ways to scam people in video chats.
Izvestia writes about this, citing experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, Director of Products at Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video using real recordings of the victim.
This makes it possible for neural networks to reproduce exactly the behaviour of a particular person.
Abu Talimov added that with the use of a deepfake, the perpetrators can call a victim's acquaintances via video call or create a video with a copy of a person to blackmail them.
"Such hoaxes can easily incite bullying because a skilled perpetrator can place people in absurd, dangerous or compromising scenarios," the expert said.
Varonis Systems lead system engineer, Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that people tend to trust others more when they can see them.
He stressed that this might create specific risks when it comes to video technologies.
David, I'll add.
In what I have written above, I have focused on the fact that all of this was purchased in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow for heavy make-up and short skirts, showing stockings and pantyhose on the legs.
This is a province, but such goods were sold in a store.
In big cities, and among Muslim women, it was customary for them to wear make-up, and to show off their legs.
This is how it is in Dushanbe, which is a big city and the capital of the Republic.
There are many fashionistas, but the same cosmetics are not available.
Five actions that can help avoid Type 2 diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the world's most common.
However, some do not take this seriously, and it is unfortunate.
Diabetes can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Prevention plays a major role in avoiding the formation of illnesses.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime: a reduction in the variety of drinks and switching to plain water positively affects metabolism.
Sugary foods raise blood sugar to a dangerous level if eaten in excess.
So, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying and keeping sweets at home.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by an unhealthy diet, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Experts advise sticking to a low-carb diet.
This type of diet not only helps to reduce weight, but also protects against sharp fluctuations in blood sugar.
To prevent getting diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fibre.
Fibre fills the stomach and gives a feeling of satiety, promotes the secretion of digestive juices and increases the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about "weekend migraine" among workaholics
Multiple factors can lead to deterioration in one's wellbeing over the weekend
Zuhra Pavlova, a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of MSU, scientific supervisor of the System Medicine Clinic, wrote in her telegram channel that the cause of deteriorating well-being after working days is often a “weekend migraine”.
According to her, this is especially common among workaholics, who suffer from headaches, exhaustion, and weakness on the weekends.
Dr Pavlova noted that, in addition to the fatigue that has built up over the course of the week, there are a number of objective reasons why the body can react negatively to changes in conditions.
On the weekends, our lives change completely.
“We sleep long, spend the whole day on the couch, probably eat more, and drink less, - the doctor justified. - Due to the lack of coffee, there is a minor hangover.
Because of overeating and a lack of water, there is a feeling of heaviness and weakness’.
There is also the added role of the later wake-up call.
For example, if you get up three hours later than usual, you will experience a reaction called jet lag.
It affects travellers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factor is most responsible for the decline in well-being, Pavlova recommended keeping track of what changes the most during the weekend.

Scientists in South Africa claim that the Pfizer vaccine is ineffective against the "Omicron" variant
South Africa says Pfizer vaccine ineffective against 'omicron'
Scientists from South Africa conducted a study and reported that the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus was low.
According to estimates, it (the neutralization rate of "omicron") corresponds (to the effectiveness of the vaccine) of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which casts doubt on the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal states.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron coronavirus variant could cause a new wave of infections in the UK with more hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in our everyday foods?
Sugar is not a good source of nutrients.
An excess in our diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and cancer diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under a foreign word in the ingredients, there may be hidden sugars - an ingredient that is equivalent to sugar in terms of calories, composition, and glycemic index.
There may be dozens of names listed on the label, which are essentially a way of saying "sugar".
The most common and often used names are glucose and fructose.
This can also include other sugars that are extracted, such as dextrose (corn sugar), levulose (fruit sugar), melasse (molasses), agave nectar and so on.
These are simple carbohydrates that include monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionary products, but also in ketchup, doctors' sausages, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar intake is to eat whole, unprocessed foods, and pay attention to the label and the many names for sugar.
Sugars vary in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in a product - syrup, nectar, refined or unrefined, brown or white - it still contains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar since it depends on not only the amount of sugar indicated on the label, but also the amount of sugar that the fruits, vegetables and other ingredients naturally contain.
This means that the actual amount of sugar might be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has stated that the import of gas is losing importance for Germany, as the country continues its transition to a decarbonised economy.
According to him, by 2045 Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil, and coal and become a climate-neutral country.
“That is, after 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role”, said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to adhere to the position that Ukraine should transport Russian natural gas in the future as well, since this resource is important for the energy transition right now.
He recalled that Germany and the United States have made a statement confirming Berlin’s support for Ukraine’s energy transformation.
Earlier, the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annalena Berbock, stated that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline continues.
According to the minister, during coalition negotiations and discussions on the coalition agreement, it was stated that energy projects should be subject to European energy law.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline still ‘does not comply’ with the requirements of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!

Hackers breach PM's Twitter
Hackers have breached the Twitter account of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The miscreants had time to post a fake message.
It was reported that India has recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office has asked his staff to ignore these reports.
The Prime Minister's representatives said that Twitter reacted quickly - the account was reinstated.
In 2020, the Prime Minister of India's page was hacked and a cryptocurrency donation appeal was made.
In the New Caledonia referendum, a majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on December 12 ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the preliminary results announced on Sunday, December 12 at noon, the majority of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted during the referendum for the independence of their territory.
However, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous votes.
According to the preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) who voted expressed their support for the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
Turnout was 43.90%, with over 80,000 New Caledonians voting.
Commenting on the interim results, AFP said that "there was no room for doubt over the outcome of the vote" as pro-independence groups had urged voters to boycott the polls.
As the initiators of the referendum, they have come out against its holding on 12 December, believing that a new outbreak of COVID-19 on the archipelago is interfering with holding a full-fledged and "fair" election campaign.
As such, this abstention paved the way for the third victory for the pro-independence camp after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, and in 2020, 53.3%.
The separatists said they do not recognise the results of the last vote and will contest them at the United Nations.
The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, will speak on the results of this referendum on Sunday, December 12, at the Élysée Palace, officials said.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has dominated the final weeks of the French presidential election campaign.
A number of presidential candidates have spoken out in favor of keeping the territory French, as it is "the last remaining European presence in the Pacific Ocean."
“New Caledonia must remain French”, Eric Zemmour has repeatedly said.
The Republican candidate, Valérie Pécresse, who published an article in Le Figaro at the end of October calling on Caledonians to remain French, also made a similar statement.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the President added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, has expressed "a strong desire for the choice of the Caledonians to be a choice for France".
Hi, Svetlana!
I bullied you a little... a lot, and I'm still embarrassed and ashamed.
Thank you for sticking with my channel.
On the subject: I am not an artist, I love to draw, but it always turns out to be inspired gibberish.
But as an artist, it has nothing to do with being an artist: there’s nothing to change about it.
Just remember that the food was NATURAL, so obesity was not so widespread as it is now.
On the other hand, there was no medicine – just leeches, garlic, and infusions.
Now, they would put them on their feet right away.
It has nothing to do with food.
Turkey tests world's first armed drone
In Turkey, successful tests were carried out of the world's first drone armed with a laser weapon.
The Eren UAV was tested at a distance of 100-500 m, MIR24 reported.
The device is capable of neutralizing explosive devices at a distance with a laser.
The maximum altitude of the new model is 10,000 feet.
After passing the relevant tests, the drone will be issued to the Turkish military, who will use it to destroy explosives without the need for bomb disposal specialists.
The agency stresses that Turkey is one of six countries in the world capable of developing and producing their own drones.

WSJ readers criticized an article about Russia-US relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal have criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell which described his vision of Russia-US relations.
The author of the article expressed his concern that the West was allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he tries to convince readers that there is danger emanating from Moscow and made a series of insulting statements against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell’s speech, he called on Western countries to “stand up as one against Russia”.
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
‘This article contains a lot of false information’, RIA Novosti quotes one of its readers as saying.
Europe isn’t ours to ‘lose’, and Ukraine isn’t our land.
The United States and its NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," the second noted.

A 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred in the Kuril Islands area
A 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred near the Shikotan Island in the Kuril Islands.
It was reported that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km to the northeast of Severokurilsk.
The epicenter was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Peru, which injured ten people.

Ukraine to start producing new-generation unmanned aerial vehicles
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, they will begin to create ANKA-type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).
This was reported by Alexei Arestovich, an advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, on 11 December.
In other words, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other unmanned aerial vehicles.
Even against unmanned aerial vehicles.
They will feature Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: the fuselage and so on’, Dialog.ua quotes him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drones, Arestovich said that it was a matter of jet drones, and not piston drones.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which ‘exceeds all parameters’.
The first batch of drones should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich said.
ANKA was developed by the Turkish Space Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified information about the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the military operations of the United Forces in Donbass.
On December 6, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, reported that construction of a plant to produce modern military drones had begun in the country.
Ukraine intends to use drones, he said.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in the Kiev region, which will train personnel and carry out tests and maintenance of Turkish UAVs Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader’s office called the memorandum “a big real step forward”.
Two lions escape from a container at an airport
Lions Run Amok at Singapore's Changi Airport
This was reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it is still unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions was found resting on the roof of a shipping container.
The animals couldn't get to it because it was protected by a fence.
The standoff ended after the arrival of Mandai Wildlife Group staff at the airport, which manages all of Singapore's zoos.
They have immobilised the lions with darts containing a sedative and they are planning to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that a tiger had escaped from its owner and was roaming the streets of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.
The same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, and people were not harmed.
Experts warn of threat of cancer from vitamin B9
Studies have shown that having too much vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
Experts say there is strong evidence that people who do not have a vitamin B12 deficiency have a lower risk of developing certain cancers, including colorectal cancer.
However, an overdose on the other hand promotes the growth of cancerous cells.
Professor of Nutrition at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Registered Dietitian Beth Kitschen recommends keeping an eye on the amount of folic acid you consume on a daily basis.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms a day.
The risk of cancer increases only if this number is significantly higher or lower.
Kitchin advises against taking vitamin B9 (folic acid) in tablet form without consulting a doctor, and to always pay attention to dosage, and to avoid cereals and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutritionist Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down the aging process.
Since it is found in avocados, Fein recommended that men over 50 eat them more often.
In the UK, up to 75,000 people could die from the omicron variant by April
Projections from UK scientists show that up to 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months if no action is taken to tighten restrictions over winter in response to the spread of the Omicron variant.
The Guardian reported this, citing an investigation by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reported.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts, who are members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies at the British Cabinet Office, by April 2022, the country will see at least 25,000 fatalities from the omicron strain, and up to 175,000 people will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the outbreak, the hospital will be able to treat up to 2,000 infected people a day.
"Serious measures to tackle Covid-19 may be needed to avoid overwhelming the NHS if the omicron variant turns out to be more infectious than the delta variant, and current vaccines do not provide 100% protection," said Rosanna Barnard, a mathematician at LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the spread of the omicron strain continues at the current rate, then by the end of the year, there will be about 1 million cases of infection in the country.
However, by mid-December, the omicron variant may become the dominant strain in the UK.
The UK has recorded a further 1,898 Covid-19 cases of the Omicron variant - bringing the total to 6,333 - in the past 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that, in reality, this figure could already be reaching 10,000 cases.
I wanted to write a witty comment, but I only made it to this point:

Global demand for superyachts surges by a quarter
This year's superyacht building and next year's orders are breaking all records worldwide, despite calls to reduce carbon footprint and fight climate change.
The number of superyachts ordered on the global ship registry jumped to 1,200 units, which is 25% higher than last year.
In an era of fighting the impacts of climate change, it is hard to imagine that the number of people with the desire and money to buy a $50 million-plus floating fortress will decrease, writes the Guardian.
But they are growing in number.
This year, orders are up by 25% on the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been this kind of frenzy on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many people who can afford a yacht are worried about being infected on land and prefer to hide away from the pandemic on their own yacht.
The second reason is also related to coronavirus.
In the past, all these people would have gone into the office and met their business partners face-to-face. Now the vast majority of them work remotely, and meet on video calls.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that yards are already taking orders for new superyachts due in 2025 and beyond.
This means that clients are willing to pay more to have their yacht delivered at least one or two years earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he said.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, it is said by sociologists, do not want to understand that, in times of austerity, space travel, yacht holidays or private planes cause outrage in society because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are urging governments to act, and proposing new taxes and rules for the super-wealthy, even though they know it will be extremely difficult to do so because of the mobility of money.
In the meantime, it is the sheer number of superyachts ordered that is impressive, but also their specifications.
Of the 1200 ships, 27 are longer than 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building the 183-metre REV Ocean.
After its launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a ‘moon pool’, as well as a submarine for exploring the depths of the sea.
In superyachts, helicopter pads, open-air cinemas, and even a boxing ring have become commonplace. Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at the University of Indiana, says that compared to the overall amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint left by the super-rich is negligible.
But it does have symbolic significance, given that there are only around 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
It's just another example of extreme overconsumption by a small minority of people.
Scientists have discovered that the carbon footprint of billionaires is in the thousands of times higher than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 a year, then the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of his carbon footprint were attributed to his 162.5-metre yacht, Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board, the crew continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give an order, for example, to sail the yacht from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean Sea.
The owners of superyachts do not evoke sympathy from other people when they, like the richest woman in Australia, Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain on YouTube that their giant ships cannot find a place to moor.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels with a length of up to 50 metres.
The weekly dose of alcohol that leads to the development of colorectal cancer has been determined
American scientists have determined the amount of alcoholic beverages that increase the risk of developing cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that drinking four or more alcoholic drinks a week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
However, the risk of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
In fact, the risk of developing bowel cancer is higher in moderate drinkers than in women.
Scientists have not been able to determine the exact cause of the development of this type of cancer, noting that certain factors lead to the destructive process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at a similar level to a two-year-old child
Many, if not all, dog lovers believe that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they don't realise just how developed the four-legged companions really are.
For many years, biologists have carried out various experiments to find out for sure how intelligent animals are.
While a dog's vocabulary may not be as rich as a human's, new research shows that a dog can understand up to 89 words or phrases in a row.
The findings were reported in the ScienceAlert publication.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics or art, but they frequently outwit their masters.
Some breeds, according to experts, show better results in understanding human speech, but there is not enough statistical data to make definite conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered to be dog geniuses - such as Labrador retrievers.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are able to think logically, and that their ability to learn is on a par with that of a two-year-old child.

Ukraine prepares for US-Russia trade talks
The United States and Russia will “trade” on the issue of Ukraine’s accession to NATO, said analyst Alexander Kotsykov in an article for the publication, “Glavred”.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations on the issue of guarantees from the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic alliance, despite the words of the American leader, Joe Biden, about the right of countries “to join wherever they want”.
If you are offered something that is obviously unacceptable, such as selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you wouldn't haggle, would you?
As far as Ukraine is concerned, there is a deal in the offing’, the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but is striving for dialogue with Kiev.
“The preparation is conducted in a clandestine, rapid, and immediate transition to the offensive, and not in waiting for the group to be discovered and forces of resistance to be deployed”, he noted.
China is stimulating the development of the railway transport industry
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Expo and Equipment Production Exhibition held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province, Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable the trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical problems, said the company's spokesperson, Hou Zhaowen.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which was put into service earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure the increased reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe have witnessed the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-story high-speed electric trains designed in China rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. They were destined for export to Europe.
At speeds of up to 200 kilometres an hour, these trains will be running on Austrian, German, Hungarian and other European railways.
In November, the trial operation of a metro developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey started.
The train will run on the Metro line that connects the city centre to the airport.
Travel will resume on this line next year.
It will be the fastest metro in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometres per hour.
"China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness," said Feng Youshan, head of the Department of Trade and Investment Promotion of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade /CCPIT/.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of China’s production of high-end equipment in the global market”, said Feng Yaoyan.
After more than 60 years of arduous work, after carrying out a series of independent research and development, China has created a cutting-edge production equipment for railway transportation, with a complete set of auxiliary facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoyan, the country ranks first in terms of the level of electrification of railways, and in terms of the operational mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
A biologist listed the early signs of dementia
Biologist PhD Semyon Golosheikin, in a conversation with Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can include forgetfulness, as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments, such as problems with concentration, planning, abstract thinking.
At present, there is discussion that hearing loss may be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, or one of the risk factors, said the expert.
Goloshekin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are the leading causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that, as of today, doctors do not know of any effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in a timely manner.
According to him, studying foreign languages and actively communicating will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends keeping moderate levels of physical activity, regularly exercising cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logical thinking
“There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are still being discussed in the scientific community”, Goltoshevsky said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logical thinking”, Goltsovsky said.
Earlier, the UK's dementia research charity said the disease was now affecting people in their 40s, as well as older people.
Medics have named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first red flag could be problems with vision, which makes it difficult for the patient to recognise objects.
Another sign of the onset of dementia, experts say, is aphasia - the inability to find the right words to communicate what you want to say.
A neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
The former president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, requires psychoneurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said journalists the neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the council of doctors created by the ombudsman of Georgia.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
Mobility, coordination, mood instability are ongoing problems," the expert said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and that the former president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation now.
“This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-neurological rehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia”, said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
In the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical care after prison staff subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician was quickly able to overturn the sentence and reinstate his rights.
Alexandra, ‘Do you take money for this?’ – that’s what I’m interested in, where do these people come from?
Is it normal to pay for bread in a bakery, but not for the work of a tutor?
Or are we so holy that we feed on prana?
There is another side to this.
These people are parasites on society's body.
They don't work, they don't pay taxes, they live on benefits and on the money of their relatives.
They are provided with all the medical care they need.
How many mouths can a working person feed?
We feed all alcoholics, and drug addicts, who have also lost their health because of their stupidity.
Then, we get surprised by the extension of the retirement age.
These amounts could have been spent on the treatment of really ill people.
Of course, the Victory Banner will remain in our country's history forever, and there's no need to confuse it with the state flag.
The red flag has a reverse side, it is a symbol of the communist movement, so it can never be a national flag again.
It's time for the author to stop writing provocative articles, it's time for the reds to calm down and start living a normal life, and not live in the past.
Protests against COVID-passports held in Spain
In Barcelona and Valencia, Spain, there were protests against the mandatory Covid-19 vaccination certificate, Europa Press reports.
In the Catalan capital, about 3,000 people took part in the action.
In Barcelona, the Covid pass is mandatory in bars, restaurants, gyms, elderly care homes and night-time leisure venues.
Many protesters did not wear masks.
They accused the state of totalitarianism on their banners, and called for respect for the will of the people.
In Valencia, vaccination certificates will also be required for access to large-capacity entertainment venues and restaurants.
Protesters in that city said that there was a medical dictatorship, and that the vaccination was an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for those who have not been vaccinated.
The government introduced a bill on a single QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is anticipated that Russians will be able to visit mass gathering venues, cultural institutions, food and retail outlets with either a vaccination certificate or a certificate for having recovered from Covid-19, or an exemption from vaccination.
These rules will also apply on trains and planes.

A steep ascent: how the Chinese are becoming skiers
The Olympics should bring millions of people to the slopes and help create world-class ski resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to participate in winter sports, which will enable the president’s stated goal of raising 1 trillion yuan, but will also contribute to the economic development of underdeveloped and remote provinces.
Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, which is not far from the place of the Winter Olympics, is becoming more and more popular among Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, work is also being carried out on landscaping: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are big enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China with resorts, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The long-term goal is to provide a comfortable and interesting stay at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Advisor to the Organizing Committee, Justin Downs, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year, more and more Chinese head for the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the huge improvements, it will take many more years to build a skiing culture here, Downs said.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed, and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
Gao Macong, 70, lives in Chongli, near the site of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years, there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built between Beijing and Chongli, and now there is no local resident who suffers from a lack of jobs.
There is a growing number of shops selling clothing and equipment for winter sports in the country.
Restaurants with local cuisine are opening on the slopes.
There is now a Covid-19 testing station on Tahiti.
China is striving to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in major international competitions, and ski resorts and equipment must reach world-class standards.
More than 500 million people worldwide could face extreme poverty because of the pandemic, says the WHO
More than half a billion people across the world could be plunged into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has set back decades of progress in providing universal health care, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank have warned.
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage, celebrated on December 12, WHO and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
They acknowledged that the pandemic had caused disruptions in the health care system, and had led to overburdened health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population with immunization has fallen, and the mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has grown.
The WHO and the World Bank have stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to afford treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people into "extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the COVID-19 pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty and left almost four billion people severely vulnerable.

Reuters: Taiwan minister disconnected from live feed at "Democracy Summit" at White House request
Taiwan’s Digital Minister Audrey Tang’s speech at a panel discussion during the U.S. “Democracy Summit” was muted, according to the video recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, with reference to sources, claims that the picture was blocked at the request of the White House.
According to their statement, the reason was a map that depicted Taiwan separately from China, which considers the island as its territory.
The map Ms. Tan was referring to was produced by South Africa-based non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranks countries according to how well they uphold civic freedoms.
Taiwan was marked as "free" in green, while China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam were marked as "closed" in red.
After the minister showed the map, the image on her side was changed to a screenshot with a note that the views of the participants of the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the policy of the U.S. government".
China was not invited to the "Democracy Summit".
Reuters sources note that the map Taiwan’s minister displayed could contradict Washington’s policy of “one China”.
A source familiar with the agency said that after the demonstration of the map, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as an independent country.
The Washington-sponsored "Summit for Democracy" took place on December 9-10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society groups and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “Zero Day” summit, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund, through which money stolen through corruption could be channelled into charity.
Earlier today, Yury Averyanov, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council, stated that the summit had an ‘anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge’.

China boosts prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic in cities with land border ports
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of China has issued a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the cities where the land ports are located in order to further prevent the import of infection from overseas.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities will have to provide a negative Covid-19 RT-PCR test taken up to 48 hours before departure.
Those arriving at land border checkpoints must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in force from the date the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of these cities, up to March 15, 2022.
In addition, it was noted that the cities that have land border checkpoints and meet certain conditions can consider establishing buffer zones for prevention and control of COVID-19 within their jurisdictions.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that there was a “regrettable outcome” in relations between Russia and the United States
In an interview with Izvestia, Sergei Ryabkov, Deputy Head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the protracted process of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and that problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some aspect of improving relations, it is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion after a long road we have traveled with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems started not yesterday’, the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose a number of approaches on Russia.
The deputy head of the Foreign Ministry added that he would not dare to give an optimistic forecast about the prospects of improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that progress has not been made in other areas, such as strategic stability and cybersecurity.
At the same time, Russia is urging the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the message will be heard and that the Americans will listen to the arguments of reason.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, stated that Moscow is ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
A virologist warns of the danger of COVID-19 vaccination with a nasal spray outside a hospital
People who have been vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may develop allergic reactions and require medical assistance, so the first vaccination points with this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
Sergey Netesov, a virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the Laboratory of Bionanotechnology, Microbiology and Virology at Novosibirsk State University, reported this to TASS.
It's easier to set up nasal vaccination points in airports and shopping centres, but I would only do it at first in medical institutions.
The thing is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine does exist, it is small, but it is advisable for the person to sit nearby the doctor's office after it.
Doctors have special kits of antihistamines that work within a minute or two, which is sometimes crucial’, Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centres when there is enough experience of using the drug.
He also stressed the importance of the nasal vaccine getting to the mucous membrane in the nose.
However, there is a risk that the vaccine will not arrive at its destination if the person being vaccinated has a blocked nose and sneezes after the injection.

UK reports 1,239 Omicron coronavirus cases in a day - RT Russia
In the UK, 1,239 new cases of infection with the new Omicron strain of coronavirus were detected over the past 24 hours.
Sky News reported this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the Omicron variant have been reported in England, 38 in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of cases of the new Covid-19 variant in the UK has risen to 3,137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine calculated in a pessimistic forecast that in England, by April as a result of an outbreak of coronavirus caused by the “omicron” strain, up to 75,000 people could die.
Peskov warned that Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions will suffer
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including in relation to the alleged “invasion” into the territory of the country.
“It is impossible to introduce some restrictions against Russia and not to suffer oneself”, the official representative of the Kremlin said on the air of the TV channel “Russia 1”.
Peskov asserts that “everyone in the world understands this”.
Earlier, it was reported that the United States was considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to impose restrictions aimed at making the conversion of rubles into dollars more complicated for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
However, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is certain that this is impossible.

New Caledonians reject independence in referendum
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, an overwhelming majority of participants refused to secede from France.
This was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the South Pacific Ocean islands supported the idea of independence from France.
They annulled the results of 2.99% of ballots.
Turnout was very low: around 55% of the island's population went to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by calls from separatists to boycott the referendum because of coronavirus.
Paris refused to move the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, there was already a referendum in the region on the issue of independence.
The majority of the population are in favour of keeping the archipelago as part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometres away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared that New Caledonia was a part of its territory.
Some 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has special status.
There is an 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian government, which stipulates that the region can hold a referendum on independence twice every two years.

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) has preliminarily judged that the "Omicron" variant is less dangerous than the Delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of reduced effectiveness of vaccines against the new COVID-19 variant.
According to information as of 9 December, “omicron” has been registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and significantly altered antigenic profile of the "Omicron" strain suggest reduced efficacy of vaccines against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it ("severity of disease" - Ed.) may be less severe than that associated with a "delta" variant," the WHO said in a technical bulletin.
The organisation notes that all cases reported so far in the EU have been mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain is believed to be more contagious than the "delta" variant.
Two cases of infection with the Omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They were previously immunized’, the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there are no reliable data on whether the new coronavirus variant is less dangerous than others.

Ukraine names four scenarios for Zelensky
The former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and, possibly, will make concessions on the Donbass.
Denisenkov spoke about this on Sunday, 12 December, in an article on the “Glavred” website.
The first option, which Denisenko called the ‘ideal storm’, presupposes that key western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, reaching an agreement on the country’s future without its participation.
This development will contribute to a deep crisis that Kyiv may face in 2023.
"At the same time, there is a decline in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> there are internal protests and confrontation between the authorities and key FPGs (financial-industrial groups. - Ed.)," the former parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation: ‘war against everyone’.
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in global politics, when the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Under such circumstances, the leadership of Ukraine may be willing to make concessions in Donbass, which could lead to an internal conflict.
At the end of summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, and the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former deputy, is 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is an opposition to Zelensky by groups of the population and the president, as a result of which it is possible to seize control over the power bloc and implement “populist initiatives”.
Under this scenario, Zelensky will start ‘reshaping power’, Denisenko added.
Another scenario is to turn Zelensky into the “father of the nation”.
This can happen as a result of some traumatic event that shakes the community to its core.
“The event must be of a sufficient scale to trigger a reaction from our external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine”, Denisenko said.
According to the former deputy, such a development of events is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological disaster, or aggressive actions by Russia.
At the same time, the Russian side has already rejected any possibility of an ‘invasion’ of Ukraine on numerous occasions.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from a survey by the sociological group Rating showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low at 19.3%.
This is the lowest rating he has had since he came to power.
Analysts have forecast a situation in which, in the case of the upcoming presidential election in Ukraine, Zelensky would receive 21.8% of the vote, while the former president of the country, Petro Poroshenko, would receive 14.5%.
However, only 19.3% of those surveyed supported the president.

Thank you for the story about this great sportswoman. I did not know that Elena Shushunova had died, it is very upsetting to find out.
I remember how I supported her at the Olympics in Seoul, it was live for us, the people of Primorye, it was real time.
It was such an emotional rollercoaster, I remember feeling so happy when Elena won.
They were also happy about the other victories, as they cheered for Salnikov, for the football players, for all the Soviet athletes at that time.
On TV, I saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries, and there, they rolled watermelons down the gangway onto the ship, like barrels.
The watermelons were enormous.
I myself have worked many times in my youth cleaning and loading watermelons in Astrakhan region, and I have never seen watermelons weighing more than a pound.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the vineyard and not before the beginning of August.

The side interior of the cup, in the area of the stitching of the straps, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in the hollow, without additional stitching for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated at the neckline and under the bust.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: ‘For a quote by Yevtushenko, you get 10 days, here’s the power of poetry!’
At the beginning of the week, the 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for 10 days.
A student of the HSE was detained on Red Square with a placard, on which was written the hashtag #poetrussiabiggerthanapoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Evgeny Evtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander for repeated violations of the procedure for holding a public gathering.
The first time he was detained was on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The aim was to draw attention to poetry in general, unfortunately, this interest has been lost, and there is little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poetry online using this hashtag”, Alexander explains.
We reached out to the young poet to find out about the circumstances of his detention and to get more details about the message he was trying to convey.
How did the police officers treat you this time and in the past?
What did they ask you in the department and how did they comment on your action?
This time, the officers were more courteous, the stop was as thorough as possible, and polite, if not amusing, given the context of the word.
In Pushkin Square, OMON officers took a hard line.
They asked me standard questions about motives.
When we heard it, in principle, we looked at it, if not with approval, then with understanding.
The only exception was the see-through, windswept monkey cage, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if, after the hashtag action, at least a few people start to write their own poems, I will not sit in jail for 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, you should talk in private, even in the language of the Tumba Yumba tribe.
At public and official events, they speak the language of the people present, so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their mother tongue with the help of an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, in fact, Angela Merkel speaks fluent Russian, but nevertheless, she uses an interpreter.
At official events, the old-fashioned shorthand is still taken down by hand, and the shorthand reporter is not required to know several languages.
You don't want to say much, so just say no!

It feeds their certainty that the US is better than anywhere else.
They're just grown that way.

Researchers reveal how potatoes can help fight age-related diseases
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and microelements that improve blood circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains vitamins of the B group, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
These elements help the body's systems to function.
Potatoes also help in the fight against age-related changes.
Thanks to its high content of omega-3 fatty acids, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract. Regular consumption can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the best results, root vegetables are best simmered or boiled, rather than fried in fat.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other foods with a high glycaemic index.
These are products that contain carbohydrates that are rapidly broken down into sugars, such as sugar, sweetened beverages, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, Kommersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private households and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, only imports will be able to replace the product shortage at this time.
Lostfilm, lordfilm, and other pirates will be removed from Yandex's search results
Candidates for elimination
In 2015, the RAEK/Media cluster’s copyright holders compiled a list of the top 100 most pirated websites in the Russian Internet, and the majority of them ceased to exist, says Karen Karazyan, CEO of the Internet Research Institute.
However, some managed to survive, including Kinogo, Lostfilm, and Filmix, he added.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series “Squid Game” and “Delicacy” by director Anna Melikyan – the original series from the largest video service in Russia, IVI (which is part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available on search engine results, you can watch the latest animated feature "Encanto", but, judging by the quality of the video, this is so-called screencap (a pirated copy of the movie filmed in a cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the TNT series “University. 10 years later” is available.
Svetlana M., of course, but I would not care if my son was offended for me.
If there is any misunderstanding, it is best to avoid it at all costs.

"This Polish idea" – it would be more accurate to say that Poland merely repackaged an idea from 1776, but developed it quite effectively.

I watched her interview, a young girl said that her biggest dream was to grow wings, but her dad was always pulling her back.
It's very shaky, really.
So, I got into a university, but what’s next?
Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara wall lamp.
The wide circumference, framed by "molecules" of light, provides maximum uniformity and brightness of the space.
The “nuclear” or “molecular” design, which reflects the nature and essence of each object, is still relevant and allows you to make a successful accent in the interior.
One of the main characteristics of such lamps is their lightness in weight.
Through the use of thin, practically invisible cables, which can be adjusted in height, it gives the illusion that the chandelier is floating in mid-air.
Metal gold armature and matte white miniature lamps will easily complement any palette, and the chandelier and wall sconce presented in the collection will make a complete ensemble for the lighting of the living room, bedroom, and foyer.
Well, to each his own, as they say.

Dimax Micro Ultimate, 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The design is convenient in that it has two different levels of firmness – one firm, one softer.
Only high-quality and premium fillings are included in the product, which have proven themselves to be the best.
Springs: The centre of the model contains a block of "micro-pocket" independent springs.
This means that there are 2000 coils on each mattress, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides the unique, pinpointed adjustment.
The “micro-pillow” is the most high-frequency spring block of Dimax, so it has a strong orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: A combination of layers of coir and natural latex is placed on top and bottom of the spring.
The only difference is the arrangement of the tiles.
If one surface is latex, then the other is coconut fibre.
This combination of fillings has long been considered a classic, as it not only provides orthopedic properties, but also conforms to the shape of the body.
If the Coil provides the correct support for the spine, then the latex gives the surface of the mattress the ability to adapt to the shape of the body.
Covers: Model comes with Aloe Vera quilted cover.
It can be either removable or permanent on request of the client.
The total height of the mattress is 27 cm, and the recommended load for the sleeping surface is 170 kg.
Guarantee and security: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has all the necessary certificates and documents confirming its complete safety and reliability.
The foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, Aktuálna kamera reported on Sunday.
The objective of future missions, which are scheduled to launch in five years, is to assess the habitability of Venus' clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
So far, it was thought that Venus, the planet closest to Earth, was so acidic that life couldn't have existed there, but it turns out Venus was likely once Earth-like.
A sample from Venus is expected to be blasted into space as part of the third mission.
Suppose we find life there, the main question will be whether it is Earth-like or different.
If it looks too much like Earth, it will be obvious that life did not begin on Earth.
If it differs, then it is more likely that life began on Earth’, said Mihkel Palusalu, the leader of the Estonian Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The metaverse was a big deal this past fall, with Mark Zuckerberg announcing that Facebook was changing its name to Meta.
This is an important signal for the market: the largest player has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, just like anywhere else in the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and then monetize them.
Metaverses should be considered an extension of existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, because people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of businesses wanting to develop ecosystems and adapt their operating models to them.
The third is that they are a logical extension of the trend towards the digitalisation of assets, where any rights, securities, artworks or even money can be transformed into a digital format.
Anna, you are right: a change in diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you no longer crave fatty, unhealthy food.
Of course, we will have traditional Olivier and fish under the fur coat on the holiday, but no one is forcing me to eat everything at once.
You can eat a spoonful, taste it, and that's it.
After all, there are ten days ahead of us, and we can prepare any tasty and healthy dishes.

British economist failed to give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill failed to provide a forecast for 2022, as he believes that any such attempts will end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend could change at any time.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, with inflation in second place, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted he did not know whether the price rises were temporary or permanent.
The expert pointed out that even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of infinite generosity of central banks has run its course" and it was time to return to a system where interest rates, adjusted for inflation, would be correlated with expected rates of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that in the context of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft monetary policy could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, O'Neill pointed out that attention should also be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty reduction and climate change.
Earlier, the head of the Global Research Department of Otkritie Investments, Mikhail Shulgin, reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 remain, but the potential for growth will be less significant.
Shulgin named among the risks for the dollar exchange rate the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices, and concerns in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree with you.
However, there is one positive thing: if you compare yourself with yourself, there were fewer containers five years ago.
It gets better now.
There's progress, but it's slow.
There is another problem: in cities, there are a lot of environmental initiatives, but people don’t know about them.
All the eco-taxis that pick up rubbish from your home.
It's so banal: the point of recycling. It's used by marginal types.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI), at the end of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent RUB 2.784 trillion on the purchase of new vehicles, which is 28% higher than for the same period of the previous year.
To give an idea of the scale, the government spent roughly the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In September of last year, at a meeting of heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such a figure is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country’s GDP for 2020.
By revenue, the South Korean brand Kia is leading on the Russian market.
In the first 10 months of this year, it managed to sell cars worth RUB 325.7 billion, which is almost 24% higher than the previous year.
Kia’s sister brand, Hyundai, has seen an even bigger increase – more than 35%. Revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at RUB 279.3 billion.
At the top of the list is this brand, and in terms of the average price of a car, Hyundai has increased by almost 21%, up to 1.94 million rubles. The only brands with a more dynamic increase in price were Changan, Chery, Geely, and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, the volume of sales of Korean brands has grown not so significantly: according to the statistics of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period as the year before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Japan’s Toyota closes the top three in terms of dollar sales. Russians spent RUB 275.5 billion on this brand’s vehicles over the first 10 months of the year, which is 14% higher than the previous year.
Mercedes-Benz is following the Japanese with 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) – the German premium brand has grown both in terms of sales (by 37%) and the average price of a car (almost by 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz is experiencing good growth in sales and average prices at the same time – more so, for example, than BMW – which is why there is a higher growth in financial capacity, explained Tatyana Arabadzhieva, Managing Director of NAPI.
In terms of sales growth, the phenomenal results are being demonstrated by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
The Russian Lada, in terms of growth in revenue, is demonstrating average market results (plus 28%), with Russians spending RUB 229.4 billion on this brand of car in the first 10 months of the year.
At the same level as last year, in terms of financial capacity, are companies that saw a fall in the number of cars sold in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan, in particular.
In fact, UAZ is in the red: over the first 10 months of the year, Russians spent RUB 12 billion on UAZ SUVs and pickup trucks, compared to RUB 12.4 billion a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of automotive components and production disruptions affecting the entire global automotive industry, automotive companies continue to make price adjustments – AvtoVAZ, for example, raised the price of Lada models seven times over the course of a year, the most recent price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
Other car manufacturers also regularly change their price tags.
The volume of the car market in Russia in monetary terms will continue to increase – in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation and the desire of automotive companies to recover previous losses are contributing to this, experts say.
In the context of a shortage of cars, I think that many car companies have even been able to partially pass on the costs of previous periods to consumers, which they were not able to include in the price of the car previously.
Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at VTB Capital, said.
I think that, in terms of finances, car manufacturers are feeling very good right now, maintaining a high profit margin."
The indirect indicator of this is the pace of growth in car prices, which has been observed in 2021, the price of new cars is growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will continue to grow both in terms of quantity and monetary value, but mainly due to inflation and the increasing complexity of the construction of the machines, predicts Bespalov.
With an increase in supply, price rises will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market will continue to grow even in the next year, even if the price growth slows down. The automotive producers will be able to get their profit from the volume, notes Sergey Burgazliev, an independent consultant in the automotive industry.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to get the highest profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
Production of cars is not expected to increase for at least the next six months, and in Russia, demand is being fuelled by uncertainty about the future.
Against the backdrop of the situation on the market, cars have proved to be a good investment: a car purchased a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original price, notes the expert.
Biden says U.S. will send troops to Ukraine if Russia invades
The U.S. has never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of a "Russian invasion."
The statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
"There was never such a plan," the White House head said in response to a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in case of escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that there are no obligations for the United States and NATO to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American forces unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the U.S. will send forces to eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia).
We will have to send more American and NATO forces to the eastern flank, B9 - all the countries of NATO that we have a sacred obligation to defend from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the Russian president’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use by Kiev of the drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that ‘American weapons are approaching our territory’.
I immediately leave such interviews.
If, during the interview, they want me to listen to screams, wait hours, drink some incomprehensible gibberish, and then wash a cup, I shudder to think what it will be like at work.
I will find a normal place, without the HR layer, where I can talk to the manager right away.
Promtex-Orient Monolit Combi 16, 100x185 cm
The Monolith Combi 16, a medium-height mattress without springs from Promtex-Orient, is made from alternating layers of natural latex and coconut fibre.
It is soft on one side, and firm on the other.
The sophisticated white quilted cover, made from Jacquard fabric and lined with synthetic padding, is finished with a zipper around the edge.
Two types of filling.
The sandwich model consists of eight layers of filler.
In between the layers of latex there are thin layers of coconut coir.
The layered structure of the mattress makes it more durable, long-lasting, and resistant to pressure.
Natural latex is a dense, flexible, breathable material.
The filler keeps its shape and recovers quickly from loads.
Coconut husk fibre increases the strength of the product, and has a natural antimicrobial effect.
The combination of these two materials makes it possible to create a sturdy, orthopaedic sleeping surface that will last for many years.
Universal and orthopaedic.
The mattress is suitable for people of different body types and ages.
The medium-firm surface is versatile, offering a balance of orthopaedic support and comfort.
The underside of the mattress is less comfortable for soft tissues, but has more pronounced orthopaedic properties.
A medium-firm mattress is more suitable for those who need "relief" for their back and want a healthy posture.
The mattress is ideal for one person or a couple.
Those who suffer from back pain, in particular, will appreciate the presence of a stable surface and the lack of a roll-effect, whereby movements on one side of the mattress can be felt on the opposite side, disrupting sleep.

If a fraudster calls from a similar number, like a “police officer” from the Ministry of Internal Affairs or another law enforcement agency, then it’s ineffective to hang up right away, and it won’t be possible to add the number to the blacklist in time.
Because to confirm his lie about his involvement in the security agencies, he quickly dials the number and continues to scare and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
It's bullshit, really.
I just can't believe it happened.
They no longer know what to come up with, who to blame.
We made it to the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame, except the most guilty...
Wouldn't it be easier to leave people alone from compulsory labour, of course, if we care about our people.
Maybe all the strains of the virus will disappear...
As in Japan... before the elections, the influence was weakened and the number of infections decreased...

Alexander Sokurov's student film received the European "Oscar" for best editing
The Russian film “With Clenched Fists”, which was nominated for an Oscar, received an award from the European Film Academy (also known as the “European Oscar”), in the category of “Best Editing”, Moskovsky Komsomolets reports.
The jury of the contest, which voted online because of the difficult epidemiological situation, appreciated the outstanding skills of the filmmakers.
The film "Where Are You, Aida?" by Jasmila Žbanić (Bosnia) received the maximum number of awards this time.
The film's central character is a UN translator who tries to save her family during the Bosnian War.
As for the drama "Clenching Fists", directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), this film is about the complicated relationship between an authoritarian father and adolescents who want to free themselves from the father's control in North Ossetia.
Earlier, it was announced that this film was nominated for the "Oscar" as the best film made in a foreign language.
As regular friendly get-togethers between the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey show, you, to put it mildly, are not in the know.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian KAMAZ enterprise.
