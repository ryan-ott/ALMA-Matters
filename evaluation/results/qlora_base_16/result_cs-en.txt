A big comeback of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel Francouz called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
Thirty-five-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and will soon be able to get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvinov, Pilsen or Chelyabinsk was injured in the preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He was pulled in the middle of the Vegas game and has not played in the NHL since.
The incident happened when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one post to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury to his lower body," the Denver outfit announced earlier in October.
He was sidelined for more than two months before returning to NHL ice.
He was called up from the farm on Sunday morning (US time), where he played in four matches and regained his old form.
He had a 94.5% save percentage in the AHL.
A product of Pilsen's hockey, he wants to prove himself and confirm that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had problems with his knees in the last year, and he didn't play a single match in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, the "Frenchman" played 36 games, with a success rate of 92.3%.
Charles gives Camille a Christmas present, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles has also posted his own tribute, which featured an image of him helping his wife, Camilla, put on a face mask during a race.
This was reported by the British news channel BBC on its website.
They send messages to friends, colleagues and the charities they support.
This was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing a long summer dress in khaki, and Princess Charlotte is also wearing a dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, has joined his brothers, Princes George and Louis, in wearing shorts and a polo shirt.
William and Kate did not specify who took the photograph, and it is not clear when it was taken.
Last year, the Royal Family posed for a Christmas card photo in front of a hay bale outside their country estate in Norfolk.
A Christmas card has also been released by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured the scene at Ascot racecourse in June.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask, which matches her light-colored outfit.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbrovi a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminal investigators in the current corruption scandal are said to have worked on the premise that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, had been promised a million crowns from Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz server reported that he had access to a part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice club, stated that the red and white did not engage in any corrupt practices.
The server published transcripts of police recordings, in which the former sporting director of Slavia, Jan Nezmar, who left the champions' club last summer, featured prominently.
The former influential official was in frequent contact with both Berbra and the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also one of the defendants in the case.
The police are reportedly working on the assumption that Slavia offered Berbrovi a financial incentive to win the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a bribe of one million Czech crowns from SK Slavia Prague officials in return for his team winning the league, reported the server from the court file.
The next day, according to criminal investigators, Berbr met not only with Nezmara, but also with Slavia's Chairman of the Board, Tvrdík.
It is not clear from the file whether the police are still interested in this information, as reported by the server.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt activities.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal activities, have not tried to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and have not provided anyone with any financial incentives in this regard," said Tvrdík to Seznam Zprávy.
In the leaks, Nezmar abuses some former Slavia players of dark skin, and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing via referees was triggered by a police raid in several locations, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague, in mid-October last year.
At the top of the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football role.
In mid-January, he was released from custody, just like the former Vyšehrad sports director, Rogoz.
Helicopters, tanks and BVPs are LARPing the Cold War.
The tanks will be new, but basically worse (the gunners will have to fire from a protected cabin and load the shells manually, without protection).
Cars - Toyota Hi-Lux - are new and good
Heavy trucks and armoured vehicles – at a decent level, and we have managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialised units.
Aircraft: combat-capable, but at the end of its lease, transport-capable, but too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and small, with limited combat potential
Rockets - we don't have them at all (but we are producing and exporting them)
Air Defence: medium - cold-war, obsolete; short-range - good, modern, reasonably good.
I have such a story.
I have the police station right next to the city.
There was a nutria in the river eating the crops, so I went down there to see what was going on.
When I arrived, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a scene, so I just sat down and the guy probably didn't notice.
I hoped he would go away before anything came out, but of course, the fox came out sooner or later.
I let her come to within 40 metres before deciding to shoot.
The poor fisherman was almost embarrassed, waving his torch around in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before I got off the horse, it was all over.
Basically, it means that a man can be a wanker.
On the other hand, this is not a war, which would require a series of coincidences for something to happen. You would probably be seen on a thermal imaging camera, which is used by almost everyone these days.
So, you put valuable things on your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Interior ministry secured respirators at a significantly lower price than the Ministry of Health
The state, which is responsible for procurement and distribution of masks, face shields and respirators for the professions most exposed to coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their procurement in recent weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the price of respirators varied by hundreds of Czech crowns from one day to the next.
Why did prices fluctuate so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others have to pay more?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Dominika Kubištová, editor of the iRozhlas website.
I respect soldiers and armies (perhaps I am not affected by the memories of the CSLA, which older generations went through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have a big warehouse with modern equipment that could be used by the trained soldiers, we don't even have modern equipment for the current professionals, in addition, modern equipment is still more complicated, so the skills of the reservists will rapidly decline over time.
In terms of modern conventional warfare, where troops can be deployed quickly, there won't be time to train them again.
In conclusion, militia/territorial defense forces are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where it is imperative to have a mass guerrilla and it is an outright necessity to intimidate the enemy.
Only in a conflict of this scope and intensity will it make sense to fight on the territory of the Czech Republic, and we do not have the right geography for that.
We don't have the individual skills.
That is not even the worst thing.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they didn't have it at all.
Then you find yourself in a situation where you look like a loser who missed an empty net 2 minutes ago, and you see a guy alone between 2 or 3 Swiss players, and you think "oh, and what do you think is going to happen now?".
Of course, they will take it from the average taxpayer.
This situation with this skill "to draw a defender" is so bad that I find myself genuinely surprised when our attacker manages to beat one player of the opposing team.
The first swallows
The Covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major changes in the coming weeks.
The pressure on hospitals is expected to continue for some time according to statistical models, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to be more contagious than the currently dominant Delta variant.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with 100% certainty whether it can cause a severe course of the disease, whether vaccination or post-infection immunity gained from a previous infection helps against it.
This week, however, an unexpected plus has emerged in the Covid equation: treatment.
A new antiviral drug, molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic. It reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and hospitalisation by a third, and it can be used at home.
Paxlovid, developed by Pfizer, is also expected to be available soon, with an efficacy rate of up to 85%.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic have highlighted the issue of how the administration here is prepared for the arrival of new medicines, in addition to the hope that the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic will be expanded.
As mentioned, the first to be made available to Czech patients will be molnupiravir from Merck.
The company was the first to bring a treatment to the market because it had been developing the drug for a long time before the current pandemic, to find an appropriate treatment for equine viral infections in South America.
This study often neglects the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open-minded and do not share their opinions openly.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially Czechs, are used to speaking “as if our necks had grown twice as big”.
You do research and ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist scum.
Then they go and vote for the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and being lynched by the media.
It looks good in the polls, the West is good, the East is bad.
But they actually find out what people think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmour have more than 20%.
In fact, we know that there are three of them, and they are completely identical.
They are all the same for the same reason: so that soldiers do not have to re-learn where everything is when they move from one unit to another.
One is now the Atom Museum in Brdy, and the other two are abandoned.
It's funny that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for safety reasons or because it would be quicker to deploy the warheads if they were located in a western location.
In these underground bunkers (there are two in each oak tree), only the nose cone, not the entire missile, was stored.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit would be sent, which would pick up the warhead and mounted it onto a carrier device.
In addition to the museum's maple, the other ones are in a deplorable state.
In the second grade of primary school, we had a classmate called Cigán, we were with him for four years.
He was quite cool, cracked some good jokes, went overboard at times, but he was our mascot.
Everyone liked him, he often came, he wanted to explain something, he was almost never absent, he came regularly, he was involved in sports with us, he did not steal snacks or phones, he always came neatly dressed.
He went on field trips, did a lot of jungle stuff, but he was cool, I don't think he ever got in any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings were placed in the same year, in the same class, with the gipsy children.
A short while later, they beat up a teacher, the police were often involved, they threatened and intimidated the other students...
Personally, I occasionally sell something on an ad (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I've often sold to Cigáns, they always had the money, they didn't try to trick me into paying more, the communication was calm.
I have even sold a car in this way, and a month later the guy called me to say that he had transferred the ownership to himself.
I personally say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or whatever, as long as they behave in a way that is acceptable in a decent society (work, function, doesn't beat women, basically normal behaviour).
However, if someone comes, stretches out their hand, and squats in other people's flats and houses, leaving a mess around them, and causing problems... it doesn't matter what colour they are, it will irritate me.
I have no problem with African migrants if they get involved, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
I don't care if they believe in Allah, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice
"A young woman suffered a serious multiple trauma and despite resuscitation efforts she died at the scene," said Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian Emergency Medical Service to Právo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was travelling in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov, and for still unknown reasons, veered into the opposite direction in a bend.
After a collision with a Škoda Octavia, a Peugeot ended up on its roof on the verge, said Štěpánka Schwarzová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian Police.
The young driver of a Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It involved multiple traumas and he was pinned in the vehicle.
After he was freed, he was provided with emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to a stabilised state to a hospital in České Budějovice, said Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
For packages from non-EU countries, there are new rules, which customers often do not provide
Lukáš Neuheisl orders several times a month from abroad.
He mainly collects trading cards.
"It can be in the tens of dollars, say, from ten dollars upwards, where it still makes sense to import from Japan, especially since the post is often free there," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive for him. He now has to add VAT and submit data for customs procedures to the post office.
He gets an email saying that customs are expecting the parcel.
All you have to do is fill in the information about the consignment, and if the VAT was not included in the price by the seller, the customs office will calculate it from the total price for the consignment and delivery.
In case the consignee does not arrange for customs clearance himself, the total amount has to be increased by the freight forwarder's fee.
However, according to Lukáš Neuheisel, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, attach two files, and I'm done.
It usually takes me five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all deliveries go smoothly, however.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of packages received from abroad at the international post office in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Česká pošta, the problem is that people are not responding to calls for them to provide the information needed to complete the customs process.
At the moment, there are 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information they needed and did it in time, we would be at about half of the current number, said Matyáš Vitík, a spokesman for Česká pošta.
Solutions to inflation
What would you suggest as a solution to the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to grow further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on foodstuffs and motor fuels in Poland. Do you think this is the right way to go?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it's heading?
Prices are growing faster than wages, and I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, in addition to your salary (if you are an employee)?
This year, I got a 2% pay rise, which is a joke, but at least I have a similar income from my business.
Can someone explain to me why the perpetrators who have been proved guilty are sent to jail for only 6 months?
This just doesn't make sense to me, how a court can send such an animal away for only 6 months, so that it can do it all over again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing in comparison to the trauma that the victim will carry with them for years to come, it will affect their sexual relationships and all relationships really.
In addition, the victim of rape may never recover from the trauma.
Does this deter potential future victims of rape from coming forward?
Man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from Hrob unintentionally helped the guards to apprehend his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom there was an arrest warrant.
He called her himself.
He went about it in a roundabout way.
He approached a passer-by and invented a story that he had been robbed.
Officers were called to the scene and couldn't believe their ears when the alleged "victim" told them that he had made the whole thing up in order to get the police to come.
In fact, he just wanted to advise the police officers how to lodge a complaint with the Czech Republic's Police.
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the guards discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, and that there was a national warrant to arrest her.
The case is therefore being dealt with by the Czech Republic's Police Corps.
A sincere question to the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that Slavs have long ceased to be ethnically and culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, it is a shame that Churchill did not manage to secure the liberation of Prague from the USA:')
Of course, I'm not denying that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know if it's really the case that a rational person can actually believe something completely without proof just because it might pay off.
I would not consider this to be a matter of faith.
I can't agree with Pascale here, there are approximately 10,000 different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I would say that it is very likely that in thousands of religions there is at least one god who will torture you if you don't believe in his god.
After all, the Ten Commandments say that there is no other God but Yahweh.
So, would it not be more rational to refrain from believing in any god at all, rather than to take the risk of believing in the wrong one of the thousands of gods out there?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent entry into the reserves.
The Swiss model is similar, I think.
X months training (in various specializations, X months in one), under the supervision of professionals with practical experience.
If you do a good job, you might get a professional offer.
All parts of the AČR would benefit from something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can put it this way: There is constant talk about cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies are fishing in schools, and there is some kind of crossover, where the workforce migrates from education institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process continues throughout our lives. We are always learning new things, changing fields, etc.
This should also work across the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that Russians, Germans, or Mongolian raiders will never invade here again.
I find it funny that you consider NATO as something set in stone. We have allies, and they will protect us if things go wrong.
Please, sir.
All it takes is one election in the US to deflate their budget and bring NATO to its knees.
The English will swap us for Russian money, the Germans will swap us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they will do anything to get what they want.
The only long-term guarantee for independence is an army that is well-armed and well-trained.
Any teenager these days can pilot a remote-controlled aircraft, so why not?
We don't need a fortification on the border, which is obsolete nowadays, but a rebellious teenager with a remote-controlled device will be able to deal with it.
How to survive the box tsunami
Do you open the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly find yourself surrounded by boxes and packing material at home?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that are short of packaging materials.
As a result, a map of businesses that will accept your used packaging has been created.
Not just at Christmas.
All packaging is designed to withstand multiple trips.
That is why it is a shame to treat them as waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper inserts to the participating shop (there are almost 150 of them on the KAMsNIM.cz map).
It will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste, and avoid overfilling the blue bins.
Retailers themselves are welcoming the packaging, which is currently in short supply, as well as the savings made, since packaging cardboard has increased in price by 50% over the past period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I am thus strengthening my brand.
One such business is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-friendly cosmetics and cleaning products.
We receive boxes and packing material from individuals in Popovice near Brno, but we are also contacted by individuals who have piles of boxes at home. However, we are also contacted by companies that have regular collections of cardboard boxes arranged with us.
All of this will be used when packing orders from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application shows not only the pick-up points for packaging material.
It is used as a search engine to find places to get rid of things you no longer need (e.g. where to throw away household rubbish, where to give away expired medication, old tyres, old electrical appliances, batteries, light bulbs, large quantities of rubbish, etc.)
All waste can end up in the right place, and reusable items can find a second home.
In total, the map contains over 100,000 such locations.
"We are adding more and more collection points, re-use centres, textile bins, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste," said Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the Ukliďme Česko (Clean up Czech Republic) association.
It seems to me that it is wrong for technology to be so easy and impervious these days, so that children who use computers or phones to play games do not learn the basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (especially in English articles) that university students do not understand the concept of components on computers.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple applications for photos, or generally mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying file system with folders and put everything on one screen in the application.
They should be allowed to use this technique from a young age, but most importantly, they should learn something.
Let's rewrite history, shall we?
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French Presidency of the EU – which starts in January – and it was a great show.
Macron spoke for an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans – at work and on the streets – and mentioned so many events that it would be impossible to attend them all in half a year.
French politicians love it, and so do French voters.
Macron's supporters agree on little, but they do agree on one thing: Europe.
In France, there will be new presidential elections in April.
The electoral calendar has also affected the priorities.
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe", and that France is ready to create conditions for the work of historians.
A number of commentators have jumped at the opportunity to criticise Macron for engaging in pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during the Second World War, was not so bad, and he is having some success with it.
Let's take Macron's idea with a grain of salt and stop worrying about what's going on in France.
Do you need it?
In European countries, students are often taught their history as a story of us versus them, rather than a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
However, if they do not have an enlightened teacher, they will not learn about the wider context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Myš" team did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, also won the awards for Best Director and Best Actress, for Jasna Đuričić.
This year at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, it was in the top spots of the viewer ratings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I am not young, I am not healthy/fit, and I am not vaccinated.
It was like having the flu/being under the weather. I had diarrhea for a couple of days and did not feel like smoking...
It was worse than a normal flu.
I do not have diarrhea with the flu.
(This is just my personal experience. I do not claim that this is the experience of everyone.)
Christmas Book Recommendations
The Christmas double issue, which will be published on 20 December, will feature a traditional literary supplement.
A cultural tip will also come out with it.
We are giving you, our subscribers, an additional booklet with this digital edition, so that you will have enough time to get books as Christmas gifts.
A prose text continuing the previous collection by Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of observations and descriptions of the world and ordinary things with extraordinary poetic awareness, depth, and atmosphere.
In his second novel, the photographer Šesták tried to capture the essence of a small town and Czech society.
A story about the return to its roots, which turns out to be just a longed-for illusion.
A Czechist and comparatist translates the story of Little Red Riding Hood into the setting of a contemporary village.
Her performance is so much more brutal than anything else I've seen, and it builds to a horror of emotional vacuum.
That the path back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit.
In his last novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story about repatriation than we have become used to.
Those who stay, and those who go, know too little about each other to live together.
Trains are running according to the new timetable, some carriers are changing
Since Sunday, trains in the Czech Republic have been running according to a new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some lines, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is replacing České dráhy.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, and sometimes also the route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
České Railways plan to operate an average of 6,783 passenger trains a day in the new timetable, with an average of 478 long-distance trains a day.
The trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres under the new timetable.
Trains running alongside domestic routes in the new timetable will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will introduce dozens of new trains with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains travelling on the line from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will also use new carriages in the north of Moravia and in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year by an average of 3.2 per cent.
Railways take inflation into account when setting their fares.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is the introduction of line R23 connecting Ústí nad Labem, Mělník, Nymburk and Kolín.
The carrier will replace České dráhy here after its success in the competition held by the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains on this line, eight in each direction.
There are further changes to long-distance services between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at stations in Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express kept its 16 trains, two return trips to Slovakia, and weekend trips to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the timetables of its long-distance trains as similar as possible even during the planned maintenance works.
The operation of Arriva's trains and those of other operators is expected to continue largely unchanged.
The train operator will also be changed on some regional lines.
Passengers can look forward to changes, for example in Česká Lípa, where trains on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk will be operated by Trilex, a German company, Die Länderbahn.
Passengers will be able to use the same ticket for the second year in a row for travelling by train.
As with ČD, their price will be increased by 3.2 per cent due to inflation.
I must disagree.
Are we going to learn the other side's point of view?
We always hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and they had to work hard, they had to die.
I have never heard a sermon from the point of view of the slave-holding side, or from that time, no one is advocating it, they are denouncing it.
No one will tell you at school that black people were often sold into slavery by other black people, and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one teaches you at school that the colonisers often bought the land from the indigenous people, everywhere they just tell you how brutally we, Europeans, exterminated them, but they were killing each other long before.
I spent some time in the US, at school, both in the north and in the south.
I have not come across anyone deliberately concealing the facts, but I have heard that this has happened in the past, and in my opinion, this is a problem, which I do not deny (for example, in Japan, the atrocities of WWII are quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white, and we tend to look at it through the lens of today, without really understanding it.
History doesn't care about people's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal error to judge people from the past without looking at the context.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it.
By the way, if we are talking about Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good achievements, and I found it absurd to reject them.
In addition, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it nowadays.
A lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner, and there were a lot of things they didn't like.
I would not compare this with the Russians. They deliberately omit certain facts, lie, and manipulate. In addition, we do not exist in their eyes (there was a video on YouTube with a TV channel where someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968 was turned off).
What I found amusing in US schools was the rise of Marxism and idealism about communism, something that their country had never seen.
In general, I found that it was quite bad at some universities. The students were quite radicalised and, in some cases, the universities even encouraged it.
I mean, if you think about it, these people are going to be much older one day and it's quite scary to think that this could be the majority because there are so many young people and even within the ruling elite.
I think that, for example, feminism has long ago achieved what it set out to do, and it is no longer about the same thing; it has become radicalised.
At the moment, people who have nothing to do with feminism are calling themselves feminists and ignoring the basic biological facts. This leads to radicalisation on the other side as well, and it often leads to opposition to things that are quite reasonable.
In addition, the more radical someone is, the more likely they are to be heard.
Anyway, at the end of the day, I haven't come across anyone who has condemned me for colonialism or slavery.
I've mostly come across bad geography, but it was a two-way street :D
It's not because I don't like it here, it's just that I think it doesn't really matter.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be unnecessary from a personal identity perspective.
If I had to choose one thing that connects me to people, it would be our interests, our outlook on life, and our shared experiences, rather than where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you that we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than about politics, but then he always comes out with some bullshit about coronavirus, so everyone is ashamed.
There is of course the Czechoslovak Church Hussite.
They are officially Protestant, but in fact grew out of Catholic modernism and are in fact Catholic without the Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to a Hussite service because it is theologically very similar, but the members are more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická ulice.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael in Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans, and they hold a Latin Mass there every Sunday at 15:00, as they did before Vatican II.
A flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the Scouts have taken it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame, which was lit in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, has been brought to the Czech Republic.
However, the skaters did not go to Vienna this time because of the coronavirus pandemic. In the morning, they picked it up from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
Last year, it was also handed over at the border.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year, and I am looking forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to be chosen, said the girl scout Amálie Budíková to the reporters present.
Last year, the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, and this year at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing on the car park.
Scouts usually go by train to Vienna.
There is no change in the delivery of the torch across the Czech Republic.
The scouts went by train first to Brno, where they will hand over the Bethlehem light to Bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday 18 December, scout couriers will take care of the distribution of the torch, travelling on selected express and local trains.
From there, the torch will be passed on to local Scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flame across the Czech Republic, even to places not served by railways.
This year, Scouts are required to follow guidelines for preventing the spread of coronavirus.
It's going well, just like last year.
We are advising couriers and organisers of local events to of course wear face masks, keep a safe distance, limit the number of people, not to sing to their colleagues, in short, to behave in a way that will make it as safe as possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, a spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light Festival.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the message of peace, friendship and harmony along with the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope and light that overcomes the darkness for believers.
In the Czech Republic, the distribution of this plant has been in the hands of scouts and scouts for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All information, including a list of places where people can come to collect a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I do not have an economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer on the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole are a problem.
Development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education will make good use of these funds. However, I do not understand why these funds are going to agriculture, industry and, in general, companies.
As mentioned, it produces a useless product and distorts the free market and "natural life of a company".
I work in a factory where there is a million plaques on the corridors saying "this project was financed/co-financed by xy" and such a company is simply kept alive.
This is not supporting a company that provides jobs to x people. This is slowing down the development of a company that is holding on by a thread and taking away contracts/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its collapse.
Absolutely, it's terrible.
Sometimes even someone who was born in the internet age will fall for a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I think that online advertising doesn't move with me, but then I get caught out that it has influenced me - it's just so clever that you can't avoid it.
This is why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, who are currently calling for a complete ban on programmatic advertising...
It is all rubbish, in the words of the classic - I would ban the internet.
Yes, I feel that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe in something that the majority believes in and makes sense, I am not an sheep, I will rather believe in something that is less likely and makes less sense, but it is important that I will have my own original opinion about it and I will say that it is critical thinking."
2. "I can't believe everything I read in the media."
3. "I don't trust politicians."
TV stations have embraced the Christmas movie trend, with two hundred new movies this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies and will premiere a record-breaking two hundred this year.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
Christmas family and romance movies have been a big hit with the audience in recent years, and the number of such films is growing.
This year, there were four times more Christmas films made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb's count includes only those films with the word Christmas in the title, so the actual number of Christmas-themed films is much higher.
The films traditionally associated with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated with fairy tales. Internationally, however, the most popular films are Sám doma, Láska nebeská, and the classic Christmas film Život je krásný from 1946.
However, the boom in Christmas films only started in 2009, when the American cable television channel Hallmark released a special film series, recalled the BBC website.
Her Christmas project, Countdown to Christmas (Odpočítávání do Vánoc), originally featured four films and was a huge success.
This station started to tune its viewers for Christmas as early as 22nd October this year, and will show a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitor Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies this year, and the overall total includes popular streaming platforms such as Netflix.
"In this magical time of year, it doesn't really matter what the story is about, as long as there are lots of Christmas trees and it's snowing," said Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, in a tongue-in-cheek manner.
"It's a form of escapism for the audience, and a way to have some calm for two hours in the midst of all the festive madness and the general madness of the world we live in now," he added.
According to him, for example, the Hallmark channel uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there is a misunderstanding half an hour before the end, which is resolved in a successful way and they kiss.
It just goes on and on, and as long as all the movies look the same and feel the same, people will keep going to them, he added.
Mazepin tested positive for Covid-19 and will not be able to take part in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for Covid-19 and will miss the final race of the season.
Haas will only send one car out on the track.
He was looking to improve on his 20th place finish from qualifying in the last race of the season.
However, Russian driver Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not be taking part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for Covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will be on the starting grid. Mazepin's teammate, Mick Schumacher, will start from the last position. The first will be Max Verstappen, who will fight for the title with Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepin is said to be fine, according to the Haas team, and is not showing any signs of illness.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will be following the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, and the safety of all involved will be our priority," said her representatives to Formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver, nor is it allowed.
A stand-in would have to compete in qualifying or another session later in the weekend.
This is the first time a rider has been forced to pull out of the race due to Covid-19.
Kimi Raikkonen tested positive for Covid-19 at the start of the season, with Sergio Perez and Lewis Hamilton also testing positive last year.
You could get locked up for doing something like that.
Everyone will steal because the boss said so.
Under the law, COVID-19 is considered an infectious disease.
It is in the same group as HIV, plague, yellow fever and typhus.
Article 152: Spreading a dangerous infectious disease
(1) Any person who knowingly causes or increases the likelihood of infection or spread of infectious disease in humans will be liable to imprisonment for 6 months to 3 years, or a fine, or both.
(2) The offender will be punished by imprisonment for a period of two to eight years,
c) by committing an act which is in breach of an important obligation resulting from his employment, trade, position or function or which he is under an obligation to perform under the law.
d) causing grievous bodily harm.
(3) It will be punishable by imprisonment for a period of three to ten years if the offender causes grievous bodily harm to at least two persons or death as a result of the act mentioned in paragraph 1.
(4) It will be punishable by imprisonment for a period of five to twelve years if the offender causes the death of at least two persons as a result of the act mentioned in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will stun you!
It's like a travelling jewellery shop, and he put six months of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but I didn't have a lot of experience, we didn't have a lot of sweaters in our house growing up," Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on the project over the course of a year, said.
He bought the silk in Italy, 24 carat gold thread in France and 2,000 decorative crystals from Swarowski.
Silver stars were decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk gives it a softness," he said of his creation, though he did not recommend washing it.
There's one catch.
"I'm skint, I need to shift this jumper as soon as possible," says Liban.
If successful, it will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater ever sold, which was sold five years ago, cost a mere 720,000 Czech crowns.

The government has approved sending up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Soldiers, scouts and drone pilots could deploy before Christmas, as the mission has been approved for six months.
They are to assist their Polish colleagues in protecting the border with Belarus and in building the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO countries in relation to several months of activities by the Belarusian regime, which is inviting citizens from the Middle East with a false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian forces are already operating on Polish territory.
Mutation of Omikron spreads in the South Moravia?
Hygiena is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We have had a further report of this variant in a pupil at Adam's school, in the same year group.
There was no direct contact with the previous cases from ZŠ Adamov," said Ciupek.
In the week, there were six cases in the region.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being done by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses at the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She added that it was two nurses from the same workplace at FN Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils from ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, and four have an asymptomatic course, according to the director.
No one suspected of carrying the Omikron variant travelled abroad
None of these people have travelled abroad, nor have they been in contact with anyone who has travelled abroad.
There is no connection with the water-polo championship, said Ciupek.
Pavla Svrčinová, the Chief Hygienist, previously stated that an international water-polo tournament was being investigated, which had taken place in Brno a few weeks ago.
We had players from South Africa and one from Belgium, who returned from the tour and subsequently fell ill.
California Cracks Down on Gun Sales.
He wants Texas-style restrictions on abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain firearms in the nation's most populous state using the same legal mechanism Texas employed in its controversial abortion law that bans the procedure after detecting a fetal heartbeat.
People will then be able to sue anyone in California who manufactures or sells assault-style weapons or high-capacity magazines.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's ruling by the US Supreme Court, which upheld a Texas law that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, overturning a landmark 1973 decision that established a woman's right to an abortion nationwide until around 24 weeks into a pregnancy.
However, the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue that arises from the innovative design of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban was actually moved to the public arena, which prevented the Texas Republicans from attacking it through normal judicial channels.
"I am appalled by yesterday's (Friday's) decision by the United States Supreme Court to uphold Texas's ban on most abortions and to a large extent the Texas scheme to shield its own law," said the Governor of California.
"If states can now block federal review of their laws, California will use that power to save lives," he continued.
He reportedly tasked his staff to work with the state parliament and the Attorney-General on a measure that would empower community groups to seek bans on assault rifles and "ghost guns."
This is slang for illegally produced firearms that do not have serial numbers and can be used to evade regulations.
Newsom wants to give "private citizens" the right to sue for damages of at least $10,000 (about 220,000 Czech crowns) and recover attorney fees from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault-style firearms, ghost gun kits, or high-capacity magazines in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then we should absolutely do that," said the Governor of California.
The AP notes that, for a decade, California has banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style assault weapons, but a federal judge blocked that ban as unconstitutional in June.
If the state were to now reinstate the ban using the Texas model, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who, in her dissenting opinion to the Friday majority ruling, warned against the expansion of this legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court has not granted total immunity to Texas's abortion ban, allowing abortion clinics in the state to continue to sue the state's officials.
Every emergency vaccine has to go through a public testing phase, during which we gradually figure out how the vaccination scheme will look like and improve the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, there is a large-scale study from Israel on the effects of a 4th dose.
According to these studies, in most patients, the antibody levels increase by as much as five times, which has a long-term effect.
It's just like any other vaccine: in time, it will have its own vaccination schedule, but it's still too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on inactivated viruses will soon be available on the market. According to the manufacturer's specifications, it promises up to 10 times higher efficacy.

Poland threatens to block EU budget payments
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting in violation of the law if it used its new powers to withhold funding from Poland over the rule of law dispute.
The commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's plan to tap 36 billion euros from the EU recovery fund to support the economy hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.
It is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use the mechanism to withhold funding from countries that undermine the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU by vetoing everything that requires unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, whose votes would bring down the current government's majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will ask Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be understandable in view of the fact that the EU is illegally depriving us of funds from the common budget, which we also contribute to, added the Polish Minister.
It takes a more radical stance on the EU than Právo a spravedlnost, the governing party.
According to the European Commission, changes made to the Polish justice system during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is setting "impossible conditions, because its objective is not the rule of law, but changing the government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing a "political dictatorship imposed by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of a EU which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept concessions from Brussels that would undermine Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never accept that Poland will be a colony," he said.
But to understand it... Here at Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I wasn't looking at anything else, I saw the same yogurt twice, I just needed some cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes in the dairy aisle I gave up and asked.
They did have it, it was true, in the narrow section, all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and the lactose-free zone...
If I can avoid it, I won't go to the market ever again, no matter what. Even if they have a great selection, they don't have everything I need, but most of the time they have everything I need and it's well-organised, so I can get everything I need in ten minutes.
To go to Lidl for my holiday.
I don't care at all.
I have been observing for two years how data is used here like fertilizer, and that most opponents of vaccinations are just a little more out of touch than most proponents of vaccinations.
Rational discussion takes place on a professional level, but only extreme views make it into the public sphere.
It's always going back and forth.
Binary thinking: vaccines will save us, vaccines are useless.
Everything on, everything off.
A colourful cake instead of a robust analysis.
Apples and pears.
This state has things like that, and we have things like that.
But that the data collection methodology is different in the two states is not an issue.
Oh, I feel much better now.
I am sorry for my outburst and I wish you all a good day.
I was beaten with a spoon as a child.
It was never about the stamps, it was mostly about me refusing to listen and misbehaving (reading instead of going to sleep, fighting with my brother, etc).
At the same time, I have never been reprimanded without being warned first, my mother would always threaten me that if I did it again, I would get a slap (sometimes even after I had been caught, she would just bring the spoon and put it down in front of me, so that I could see it).
Only after I had been repeatedly ignored did I get a few kicks in the backside (through clothing).
I personally think that corporal punishment (in a reasonable manner and dose) is beneficial, because the child reacts much more to it than to words.
In my view, the most important part is the warning, because it gives the child a choice whether or not to listen, and if they don't, they get a punishment, and if they do, they don't.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Defence of the system
When Vojtěch Cepl, a well-known Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, was answering a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him – whether it is a sacred list, on which people swear and which they learn about in school, or whether it is an agreement that can be changed in case of need – he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once, we agreed in the Constitution on democratic rules for our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to save them from change.
Imagine this: some nations actually like their own rules.
In the same way, Czechs like gnocchi with pork and cabbage, commented Vojtěch Cepl.
Recently, however, there is a growing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended.
Years are tested by situations the creators couldn't have predicted, such as the behaviour of a directly elected president.
In one thing, however, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents suggests that any political interventions must be very carefully thought through.
It is necessary to understand and actively defend the Institute, only then can it be a key to dealing with most of the crises that societies face throughout history.
The Constitution is a set of rules for governing, consisting of a number of rules that set limits on what politicians can do.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we tie down politics with bans.
However, constitutional texts also allow politicians to wield power.
Covid-19 does not discriminate: Several-month-old baby fighting for life at FN Brno
While it is known that the coronavirus is less severe in children, there are severe cases as well, which the hospitals are dealing with, especially recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected to a lesser degree than adults, with a ratio of 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, Head of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesia and Resuscitation at the FN Brno and Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University to Novinky.
The course of the disease is usually much simpler, easier, and often symptom-free.
However, there are paediatric patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we can see, especially in recent times," added Dominik.
According to a doctor, it concerns dozens of children who require only mild care.
It takes place at the Children's Infectious Diseases Clinic.
Seriously ill children with Covid-19 have only recently been admitted to the ARU.
Children with post-COVID syndrome were in hospital continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"We are seeing an increase in children admitted to hospital with acute covid pneumonia, which means they have pneumonia and require intensive care," he said, adding that the disease was affecting babies as young as six months old as well as adolescents.
In the hospitals, there are children in critical condition because of the coronavirus.
"Currently, there are children of several months and adolescents in our care," said the chief physician.
However, she is happy that, so far, there have been no children's deaths from coronavirus at the Children's University Hospital in Brno.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6th December.
According to Dominik, the psychologist is an integral part of the cooperation in the children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus ward.
It also points out that, just like in adults, vaccination reduces the severity of the disease and reduces the risk of post-COVID syndrome.
"That is why we recommend the application of the vaccine even to children," added the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you are only allowed to walk on the marked paths.
But the quiet zones are not that big.
You can see them on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In national parks outside of camping zones you are generally free to roam (but do not cross fences into the enclosure).
You are not allowed to ski or ride a bike in the forest outside the marked trails without special permission (but of course this is not controlled as strictly in national parks).
How does the conductor train?
Music is playing in my head, smiles Josef Kurfiřt.
He was brought up on the Liberec Opera and originally played on the French horn.
As a tenor, he can sing almost any repertoire, and as a conductor he has performed not only at the F. X. Šaldy Theatre in Liberec, but also at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre in Plzeň.
It cooperates with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra, or the Podkrkonošský Symphony Orchestra.
China is projecting an image of success in managing the outbreak, and of an authoritarian regime that can handle a crisis better
Miroslav Jirouš, sinologist: China is creating the impression that it has got coronavirus under control and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was deflecting criticism that it had failed to contain a virus that had turned into a global pandemic.
The country is now reporting zero new cases.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against coronavirus all over the world, including in Italy, which has been hit the hardest.
How would you like to interpret Beijing's willingness?
Is it about friendly support, or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
One friend talks to another friend: "You know, I've got an elephant for sale."
I have one and it's great.
My wife is happy because she can mow the lawn, wash the car with a hose, and the children can play with it.
It's just great.
If you want to buy an elephant for 5000 Czech crowns, I will sell you one.
Friend: Yeah, we'll have a great time...
After some time, they meet and the guy who bought it complains: "Hey, what did you sell me for a donkey?
The lawn is trampled, there are giant piles of poo everywhere, the car is wrecked, the kids are terrified, and my wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold says: you are speaking badly about the elephant, you won't be able to sell an elephant like that...
The world is controlled by great powers.
While the principle of the equality of independent states applies, it is precisely the great powers that set the agenda in international affairs.
Europe can only become a great power by working on its integration.
So far, it is working on an economic and political level (in some issues), but there is still no military integration.
I personally think that Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But, for example, in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will work out.
I had the same idea and it is quite possible.
I am not an expert in Czech, so I might be wordy.
I am just assuming that the ellipse usually contains 2 different units on the same level.
I will use an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that both are from Spain, but for "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear whether the mandarins are from Spain.
I based this on the fact that the phrase "all U.S. forces" is used, including their weapons, and that I knew the American complexes were manned by Americans.
In other words, I would expect that it is already covered by the broader concept and there is no need to further specify it in relation to US forces.
But, once again, just to be clear:
It doesn't matter if it is or not, it is a nonsensical requirement.

Vicki Holland of Britain torments kosmonaut squirrel Milly
Disturbing footage has emerged of the moment a terrified monkey crouches in a toilet before its heartless owner flushes it down and laughs at it.
Ms. Holland also fed pork, kebabs and hamburgers to the apes, regardless of their true nutritional requirements.
Gwent Magistrates Court has banned her from keeping animals for life, reported The Sun.
Experts in primate rehabilitation who have cared for Milly following her abuse say they have never seen a more traumatised chimpanzee.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating with staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued macaque called Moon.
A mother-of-four has pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to protected animals.
She was handed a 12-week sentence, to run concurrently with a one-year suspended sentence, at Newport Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours' unpaid work, a permanent ban on keeping animals, and ordered to pay costs of around CZK 12,000.
Lead trainer for the Small Monkeys, Steph Sawyer, who rehabilitated the abused animal, said: "Milly is doing well, but there is still a long way to go."
Milly needed time to get used to people again.
She cringed and shied away from everyone she saw, and any loud noise or sudden movement sent her screaming.
The squirrel refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled and happy with the male, she can still react badly to new people.
Psychological scars from the abuse will always be with her, Ms. Sawyer said.
Milly's abuse came to light after police raided her home in Gwent and found shocking footage on her phone, after she was arrested on suspicion of drug offences.
In the footage, you can hear how coarsely Milly swears.
In another video, a woman can be heard offering cocaine to a monkey, saying: 'Want some coke?
Come on, lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis with intent to supply.
In her house, they found cocaine worth £1,600 (around 50,000 Czech crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently sentenced to 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
What amazing concepts are you going to teach the prehistoric people, three times in a row, by bravely skipping over the entire 20th century?
So, you get the same things in first grade as you do in sixth grade?
The whole thing is killed by the idea of bifolding, where nobody cares whether you can do it or not, as long as you understand it.
The main thing is to write a test for 1 and then nobody cares.
Go out and ask random people on the street if they can solve a quadratic equation with its roots and coefficients.
Everyone goes through it, and the overwhelming majority will tell you that they have absolutely no clue.
What the fuck is he going to do with that?
I am a big fan of general overviews, and the reality is that people don't want to, and they don't have to.
It is pointless at that moment, and you will never get it into them.
It is being taught in part to prepare people for the day when they will need it.
But, like, the note that you don't really need to stand in front of a machine the whole time, I took really seriously... because you don't really need to.
Additionally, we are slowly approaching a time when not knowing something is a punk rock trait.
(Which is probably due to our communist past and our agitation against intellectuals and elites). However, the price we have to pay for the fact that barbarians will be standing next to these machines is simply too high.
If journalists were able to count, we probably would not have seen such a spike in Covid-19 cases.
Marriage at first sight: The war between Kadri and Andrea continues!
This is the main reason why she cannot leave Switzerland right now," Andrea replied on Instagram Stories to the curious fans who asked her why she was so disappointed with Kadri that she decided to cut all contact with him and even blocked him on social media.
There was friction between Kadri and Andreo from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move out, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic for good.
She flat-out refused to do it.
As you can see, their relationship did not end with love, but rather with mutual disrespect and even hatred.
That was an ambush! Kadri was livid in his rebuttal to Andreina's accusation that he was a liar, a gambler, and in debt.
Kadri's alleged honesty did not sit well with his younger sister, Linda.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
I don't normally comment on things like that, and we didn't really talk about things like that in our family.
I certainly don't want to evoke any sort of pity.
But when I see someone who tries to publicly hurt and smear the reputation of someone I care about, I just can't let it go!
I am sorry I have to do this the way I am, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for being such a strong character and helping our family when we needed it the most despite his young age.
It is more frustrating for me to read such inaccurate information, which is probably taken out of context.
I would like to wish that everyone knew Kadri as well as I, our loved ones, and his family, in response to Andrea's words.
I am so thankful to him!
Of course, people will believe what they read, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above everything else, and we know what really happened, she added vaguely.
A drunk thief climbed up the façade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe it.
Cao started his rampage at a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he stole approximately CZK 330 from one vehicle.
He then thought of nothing better than to climb to the fifth floor and get in through an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
In footage from one security camera, he was then seen walking away from the scene, eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they had been, and called the police.
Cchaa then held us captive.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on the day in question.
And given that he needed money, he decided to rob drunk.
The matter is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up to the fifth floor of the facade, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is linked to the pandemic emergency plan.
If it is abolished, the law will not be effective.
The law restricts the scope of business
Isn't that enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out for the local council elections on Saturday
On Saturday, people voted in the new municipalities of Komňa in Uherský Brod, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of representatives in these communities has fallen below the minimum set by law, or the elected bodies in these communities have collapsed.
A total of 28 seats were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The youngest is 33, the oldest is 69.
The processing of the results of the elections on Saturday symbolically closes a fairly demanding, but successful year.
There were a total of four new or repeated elections to local councils and, in particular, a very closely watched election to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpová, Deputy Head of the ČSÚ.
She pointed out that the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and staffing because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In Komňa near Uherské Hradiště, the Saturday elections were won by the Sdružení nezávislých kandidátů (Association of Independent Candidates), which received 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means a gain of two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also received two seats in the assembly, with 18.52 percent of the votes.
The former mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of Soukromníků, was also re-elected to the Municipal Council.
The Komňans – independent candidates – received one mandate for each seat in the municipal council.
75.48 percent turnout was recorded at polling stations.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimov, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It received 50.5 percent of the vote, which translates to four out of seven seats.
Two representatives from Sdružení nezávislých kandidátů 1 and one representative from Sdružení nezávislých kandidátů 2 were elected to the Municipal Council.
Turnout was 93.62 percent.
In the repeated elections in Lower Silesia in Most, the Sdružení Lužice a Svinčice (Association of Lužice and Svinčice), led by the mayor Jindřich John, won again.
It received 56.73 per cent of the votes and has four seats in the seven-member council, just like in 2018.
The second placed candidate from Občané pro lid, which received 43.27 per cent of the vote, will have three representatives in the Municipal Council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the urns.
The elections in Nová Ves in Liberec were won by the Nezávislí kandidáti Naděje pro Novou Ves ahead of Hnutí ANO.
The Independents received 59.88 per cent of the vote and won four of the seven seats.
YES received 40.12 percent of the votes, which is an increase compared to the regular elections in 2018, and it won one more seat, so it has three mandates.
Turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the results of the elections.
They will then be published in the Collection of Acts.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I mean, I assume you know all this stuff.
You are just playing dumb in order to have someone to “argue” with.
If it isn't, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I actually like a lot of the church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the whole point in the first place).
I don't really care what people believe in.
On the other hand, I find it objectionable how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it made, how it stifled science, etc.
In addition to all the wars it has caused, such as the Thirty Years' War
TL;DR: Believe in the spaghetti monster if you want, but state and church have nothing to do with each other
A man fell head first from a height of twelve metres.
It hit the concrete and survived.
An unbelievable fall survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, when the rescuers of the Moravian-Silesian Emergency Medical Service intervened.
The regional emergency call centre received an emergency call at about one o'clock in the morning on Saturday with the preliminary information about the man falling from a height.
Two ZZS crews - medical and paramedic - were immediately dispatched to the scene.
When emergency services arrived at the scene, they found that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a height of around 12 metres from a window and landed on his head on the concrete!
Coal caught fire in Vítkovice.
But not in the way it should, and firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the emergency services, the man was unconscious, with multiple traumas and in critical condition.
The attending doctor inserted an endotracheal tube into his airways, secured an artificial breathing apparatus, and after further pre-hospital emergency measures, the ambulance transported him to the further care of the trauma centre in Ostrava, said Lukáš Humpl, a spokesman for the ZZS MS kraje.
I am more worried about inadequate reactions from the public and authorities than about the coronavirus
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials. However, it is healthcare professionals, such as doctors and nurses, who are at the forefront of the fight against the disease.
How serious is it from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends belt
MMA had a great night with a lot of interesting results.
Things happened at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to beat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had been undefeated for seven years.
In the lightweight division, Charles Oliveira had no trouble dispatching Dustin Poirier with a choke, defending his belt.
Kai Kara-France also got the win, stopping Cody Garbrandt with a knee strike in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that nobody saw coming.
It featured the women's bantamweight title bout between Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the bout as the "mini-millionaire" on a seven-year winning streak, looking to add another title to her collection.
The match started according to the paper predictions.
Nunes started the fight very aggressively, pushing her opponent against the cage before tagging her with a knee to the body.
However, Penová did not allow herself to make any more mistakes, and she unsuccessfully tried to attack with a hook on her opponent's arm.
The second round was phenomenal, and it kept the fans on the edge of their seats.
Both fighters landed some great shots and hard hooks.
Peňová brought Nunes to the ground, where she started stabbing her.
She had to give up and shake it off.
The American caused a huge shock to everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Poirier initially got the better of it, but the tide eventually turned against him.
In the second, Oliveira was more active, trying to take his opponent down with a wrist lock.
He didn't do much, but then he created a lot of pressure, backed his opponent against the cage and peppered him with punches.
He won the second round thanks to this.
In the third round, Oliveira landed a rear-naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next bout, Sean O'Malley had a supreme victory with a knockout in the first round, where he landed a hard right hand on Raulian Paiva's back.
He eventually knocked him out with a series of precise blows and secured his fifteenth victory.
Kara-France made short work of Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another victory with her little daughter, but now, seven years later, she lost.
Is it the knee, or the other knee?
It seems easy at first.
Most Czech nouns have only one grammatical gender, so it is easy to determine whether they are masculine, feminine, or neuter.
However, there is a relatively large group of substantiv, for which the gender is not constant.
These substantivized adjectives fluctuate between the two genders.
They take on a doubled form in the inflection, and in some cases remain in their uninflected form.
For example, the words "swivel" and "knee" are masculine and feminine, respectively; the former is declined like "machine", the latter like "song".
Another group of determiners have different forms in the first person singular, e.g. "row/rows", "cauliflower/cauliflower", or "potato/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are correct and have the same meaning, so they can be used interchangeably.
Some words may vary from region to region, e.g. "cucumber" in Bohemia and "okurka" in Moravia, but in this case, the Moravian variant is non-standard, as are other Bohemian-Moravian pairs of words, e.g. "ditch" and "ditcha", "waffle" and "waffle", etc.
Some words that were borrowed from other languages were originally not declined, but they are now.
A typical example is the word "image", which is masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained in the neuter gender, but has masculine or feminine endings depending on the gender of the word.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants into Europe.
What is the situation directly on the Greek borders?
Tensions are high on the Greek-Turkish border, with a growing number of migrants trying to make their way into Europe.
Thousands of people have fled to the southern fringes of the Schengen zone after Ankara stopped blocking their path.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What exactly motivates refugees to undertake this perilous journey?
What is the situation on the ground like?
Three months without seeing the blue sky and suffocating, journalist from Sydney describes it
Devastating fires, which have plagued Australia for more than three months, have killed nearly 30 people, destroyed hundreds of millions of animals and scorched millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and inhabitants coping with the disaster?
Could the Morrison government have done more to avoid the widespread impacts it is being blamed for?
What do you think the country will have to prepare for in terms of climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to journalist Ika Detrich from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and still are very rare.
This is why you always hear about everyone.
It is uncomfortable for people to talk about how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to sweep it under the carpet.
I don't know anyone who has been falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I have seen how the people around them or the police treated them.
Victims should always be believed.
The trend has been for victims to finally open up about their trauma.
But it is still something that a lot of people keep to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse others.
This is disgusting and spitting on the victims of sexual assault, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are false" and that it is a "trend" you are only helping the perpetrators of sexual violence.
Czech Republic overwhelmed with houses in construction, families don't have money to finish them
In recent weeks and months, construction material prices have increased by more than 30%.
A number of people ended up in difficult situations because of it.
She does not have the funds to finish the construction of the family homes, and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, construction work is becoming more expensive.
As a result, people don't have enough money to finish the houses they have already started.
In many cases banks are refusing to increase mortgages, which is creating an extremely unpleasant situation.
In the best case scenario, people are moving into houses that are still under construction and not yet finished.
In the worst-case scenario, detached houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford the mortgage and rent at the same time," said Štěpán Křeček, an economist at BHS.
We will build two to three family homes a year, and in fifty percent of cases it has happened to us.
It is difficult for us as a construction company because we have to comply with certain things in the contract, even though materials have increased in price.
We are working without pay," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of a construction company.
A lot of people are going to be faced with financial problems.
If they were counting on the fact that the construction of the house would cost five million, now it will cost seven million.
I think that some will wait," added Slivoň.
The price of copper, iron and fittings for plumbing and heating has gone up the most.
Construction companies are also struggling to find workers.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction-related fields, and the influx of foreign workers is being hampered by the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuing of a building permit is currently more favourable.
"The construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent higher than the year before," said Křeček.
We are doing well and will do even better.
Real visions are lacking, says a ČRo - myšRozhlas commentator
The entry into the new year is traditionally accompanied by the speeches of politicians, in addition to the traditional celebrations.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the nation.
What is the most important thing we have learned?
As far as I am concerned, the master's thesis is a great thing. I have my own topic, which I have chosen, I am building on the bachelor's thesis, I work on it all year round, and then I write the written part in a week or two.
In the Czech Republic, the exams are completely calm if the person is not a total idiot and something is left in their head. The commission will not unnecessarily strangle them with theory.
I, for example, studied for my exams for a week, and when I was at the end of my tether, the commission would always try to lead me to some logical deduction, which I would get right immediately.
Otherwise, with these projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project (we did this a lot, it was really beneficial, a lot of learning), and then they just learn the project and they are done.
I think it's great that there is an exam at the end of the module that reflects the knowledge gained throughout the project, rather than just the presentation.
It's all good, but don't flood my inbox and phone with emails, and don't send me packages to the embassy.
You're going to be as big a dick as them.
These people have nothing to do with the embassy.
If they were against Russia, they would have to take a lot of risks, so they might have to play against them, because if they don't, they might get into trouble.
But, in fact, you can put a statue of Putin next to a statue of Winnie the Pooh.
For example, to make it so that Xi Jinping would have to look over his shoulder.
I agree with you, even though Insta stabs artists in the back.
If you don't post stories every day, and at least twice a day, your reach will drop to a minimum.
In addition, it keeps changing what it considers to be the most important function, whether it is a like, a comment or saving.
I'm really fed up with it lately, so I might have to go to TikTok, where a lot of artists in my field are really successful, and they can't get enough of it.
In the end, I would be happy if there was something more user-friendly, something that doesn't suck the creativity and energy out of artists
Statement by the Donetsk People's Republic
Yes, the Federation, no, breaking up - this is the opinion of those who are against the break-up of the USSR, as can be seen in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On 8 December 1991, the biggest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
On December 8, 1991, in Belovezhskaya Pushcha, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority or in violation of the results of the March 17, 1991 referendum, with the tacit approval of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves living abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, Russia's population has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars combined!
Earlier, the same people who destroyed the achievements of the previous 70 years in Belovezhskaya Pushcha betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and separated fourteen republics that were previously economically linked in a single mechanism from the world's largest economy.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of criminality, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, first the socialist camp and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a thing as "the vacuum of power" in political science.
Everything that was betrayed and abandoned in haste was quickly filled and occupied by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
The whole world is still shaken by events from the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a large supermarket does not necessarily correspond to its quality and durability.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it now, put it in the fridge and make it on Thursday for dinner.
In an alternate reality where I didn't buy the meat on Monday, the chain would have discounted it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - explain to me how, with a change in price, the meat would have become a burden for my digestive system?
Or, I'll wait until Thursday, when the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK/kg - how is this different from the meat I bought on Monday for CZK 120, and kept in my fridge for three days?
I answer myself - with nothing.
These statements about how if something is cheap, it must be rubbish, spoiled or low quality are so retarded, to be honest.
I recently went to Hlavas in Brno, and there was a young lady handing out some brochures in the underpass, I always take something like this with me to help out the casual labourers, they can't throw it away...
No, the pamphlet was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I sensed that it was going to be some kind of agitprop.
After reading it, I found out who published it, and in the end, it turned out to be Scientology.
No, it was like a big bowl of gruel, full of useless advice, like I should wash myself and not be a pussy.
It is a shame that paper has to be wasted for this.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you do things to please this person even if you don't realise how deep you are in it.
She threatened to hurt me because I went out with a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her flat earlier, she burst into tears and pleaded on her knees for me not to leave.
She then started to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then it dragged on for the next six months and she just got bored.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her I was breaking up with her, but I lied and said we could still talk next week to make her feel better and calm her down.
This person sucks the joy, emotions and happiness out of you.
It's better to stay away
When insurance companies raid the system, buying up all the tests and pursuing people who test positive, so that they can be treated, even if they don't know they are infected.
The only thing we've achieved is making it difficult for businesses, hauliers and others to operate because five of their employees have been forced to quarantine in a hotel for five days at random.
In the West, they have stopped this nonsense and have accepted that it is not worth dealing with an illness that is less severe than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to steal something and stroke his ego by coming up with new rules and regulations.
It looks like the old-school scammer is back again.
After several years of decline and repression of this fraudulent business, MLM recruitment is once again on the rise.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a first-year student at a university), the initial promises about product training and business skills quickly turned into "you don't need to worry about it, just get people on board".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was offering as I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people into parting with their money.
The first time you get paid, you realise quickly that in order to make money, you have to do a certain number of guaranteed products every month.
Investment-linked life insurance and mortgages were the only lucrative options, so you ended up feeling like a door-to-door salesman for pots.
What I can say is that the experience was valuable, and I learned that you shouldn't jump on every bandwagon and thoroughly check the information you receive.
At the same time, I wouldn't want to lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even do some good, but they are not going to brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
In the corporate environment where I work, I haven't seen many things like that.
HR is calm, managers are looking after their own management, and they are not sticking their noses into everything.
Regular evaluation is taking place in some way, in the form we do it here (set yourself some goals for the next year, we'll look at how it went at the end of the year) – it's more of a self-assessment, rather than someone else assessing you based on numbers, and so on.
Attendance at corporate events is also not compulsory.
But we are a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes it feels like we are a kind of a start-up that is squatting in the offices of a big corporate.
But it doesn't really bother us, as long as the results are good.
A Czech woman missing in Britain has been declared dead.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days, the British police unsuccessfully searched for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman, who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradišť had been found dead.
This afternoon, the British police confirmed to our Embassy in London that they have found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
As far as the family is concerned, we will not be releasing any further information about the case.
My sincere condolences, tweeted Kulhánek.
The young woman was last seen on 28 November in a bus on her way home from work, before she went to withdraw money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues at work five days later.
The Metropolitan Police later launched an appeal to find her, and Interpol issued a red notice for her arrest worldwide.
It was then added to the Czech missing persons database.
The police arrested a man in connection with this incident a few days ago.
What was his role in the case and what he is suspected of, it has not been revealed.
Four communities get new councils at the end of the year
On Saturday 11 December, new councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in Uherský Brod, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of representatives in these communities has fallen below the minimum set by law, or the elected bodies in these communities have collapsed.
There were 99 valid candidates competing for 28 seats in the new elections.
Turnout was 62.41%.
The highest turnout was in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters took part.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for the new municipal elections in the four communes.
There were 36 women and 63 men competing for the 28 seats.
The average age of candidates was 46.6.
The youngest candidate was 22, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of the elections on Saturday symbolically closes a fairly demanding, but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils, and in particular, a very closely watched election to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work under more demanding epidemic conditions, which required more sophisticated equipment and staffing, said Eva Krumpová, Deputy Chairman of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was completed at 03:49 on Sunday 12 December.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the results of the vote, which will then be published in the Official Gazette.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
It took me a while to get used to the fact that we have a very dangerous infectious disease in our country, but it went relatively smoothly.
It is still difficult for me to deal with the fact that a large part of the population, at all levels, behaves like idiots.
I am most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!), as it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be removed from office and would be disqualified from ever holding office again.
However, the chances of this actually happening are very low, as others have mentioned.
In addition, I am not sure whether the concealing of a file could ever be considered high treason.
High treason is the act of endangering the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state by the President of the Republic.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has impacted intimacy: More people under 35 say they have no sex for a year
More young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
This is mainly aimed at religious people, according to the Daily Mail's website.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who abstain from sex rose from eight to 21 per cent.
There are more women, aged 18-35, who say they haven't had sex in the past year.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, revealed a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher unemployment rate.
However, the presence of the media, social networks or video games may also have contributed to making sex a lesser priority for young people.
"Since 2010, there has been a large increase in the proportion of men and women, aged 18-35, who say they had no sex in the previous year," said Lyman Stone, a researcher at IFS.
People who are married are more likely to have sex, with just 5% of people in 2021 saying they had no sex in the last year.
It was 29% amongst free-thinking people. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is a small percentage.
Fear of premarital sex and religious beliefs also contribute to this decline in sexual activity.
While the chances are still higher for married men to be sexually active, the percentage of married and widowed women under the age of 35 is still decreasing.
This divides opinion among young people, with around 30% believing that premarital sex is wrong, and around 70% believing that it is okay.
"It's true that the free-agent population in that age group is in the minority, but their behaviors are pushing that number up," said Stone of the 30 percent.
For the majority of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, religion is the main reason.
Since 2008, the proportion of those in their 30s and under who attend worship more than once a month and who are abstinent has risen from 20% to almost 60%.
The "minority belief" was growing from 10 to 20 per cent," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and increased social drinking during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also found that those who were unemployed or had lower incomes were less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which may reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, hence "fulfilling" this need.
This trend gained traction during the lockdown of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole point of the Covid-19 vaccination programme is whether a company should be allowed to force a part of the population to do something that they do not want, but which might save their life.
It's a very difficult question to translate into English. I would say that I am most interested in the issue of social conscience.
So, for example, the question of whether it will be our fault if they die even though we didn't order it.
My argument is that we could well have been responsible for the death of an 80-year-old who didn't really understand what was going on, who had heard some misinformation, and as a result didn't want to get vaccinated, and then got infected and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can be held responsible for the death of an obstinate opponent of vaccinations, who, alongside the SPD and the KSČ, shouts about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners fall into the second group, so they will really be able to take care of themselves.
Czechia without snow.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent years in the Czech Republic.
The operators of ski resorts cannot do without artificial snow. The weather conditions complicate, for example, the preparation of the Jizerská 50 cross-country skiing race.
Is it a trend or an exception?
What will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about an abuser.
Once, our teacher took us on a field trip to a boatyard in the middle of the city so that we could go boating on a small boat on the river.
We once walked down a very wide road, and in the middle of it, we saw a group of followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, we got hammered.
I am lucky to have escaped, but I spoke to a friend.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I don't have a soul," she replied.
We all laughed the whole way, including the teacher, until we got to the boatyard.
We are very spoiled.
It's not much, but the system is collapsing, says Orozovič
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," said Morawiecki at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the Chancellor, it is worthwhile to resolve the crisis, which was triggered by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, through diplomatic negotiations, even in the framework of the "Normandy Group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he had informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and as a weapon, as we see an attempt to (illegally) cross the border every night.
He met with the Chancellor to discuss further sanctions, so that Lukashenko's regime and his patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to DPA, assured Warsaw that Germany would support it in its dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by Lukašenko's regime.
Drunk Polish nun caused accident, tried to cover it up
The car returned a short while later to the scene of the crash, but it was driven by a different nun, who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could lose her driving license even if she didn't give way to another driver and drove away from the scene of an accident, she confessed the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted to hitting another nun, who asked her for help.
The police then came for Celestina's sister.
They put her through a breathalyzer test and when they found that she had over two per cent of alcohol in her blood, they took her driving license away from her immediately.
They were informed at the same time that they will be questioned in court.
Hugo the dog is doing everything he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not keep an eye on his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have been inspired by American stories about pet dogs.
They forgot one important thing though: the rules of film craft.
After the kitschy film "Gump - the dog who taught people to live" by F. Brabec, the film "Here we stand guard" is now competing for the audience's emotions in cinemas.
Co-author of the screenplay and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič ml., continues the story of his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
The return of the talking dog Hugo and some familiar faces around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a pension in the Šumava region, which is dying, start to invite dog owners, Julie's father and his partner, and above all, her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but an adolescent who is experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with the storytelling in the previous dog film, but at least it entertained children and the dog.
This time, the creative duo wrote a script even weaker, which evokes a mixture of admiration and embarrassment.
Let's recap.
Julie, a scientist by trade, succumbs to the fantasies of childlessness, and when the "right constellation" comes together, she has sex with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates point to - in a car, on a church tower (of course, during an organised tour with a local guide), the retired colonel Mojmír shoots his daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, and the family takes her away from the hospital, so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the middle of nowhere.
Nothing against the healing power of nature and the strength of beloved pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
The audience wonders, however, how such a convoluted story, filled with unbelievable situations and characters, was needed to convey this message.
Two thieves from the staff, a dog trials competition, a Šumava charlatan, the police arriving on the basis of a tip-off looking for "drugs" and discussing the strength of bone meal as a fertiliser - and of course, the family in the pension naturally get drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a long coma and then sits in front of a make-up mirror with a cigar in her mouth, demanding whiskey and bacon as a recovered vegetarian, it's impossible not to laugh.
At the top of the show, the creators explain to the audience that "this sometimes happens after a coma."
Shaymovich's team lacks the basic dramaturgical knowledge of how to work with text, the ability to build a strong situation, a sense of character, and the director's leadership.
The acting is uneven, the cuts are incoherent and the overall impression is muddled.
Whatever Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová do to try, they don't have much to play.
The only redeeming feature of the film is the poetic footage of the Šumava nature captured by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and the pair of Vizsla dogs.
It's not enough to sketch a few characters, a tenuous plot, and some dog-eared catchphrases, let alone coarse, popular slang that the characters might actually say.
It is not an argument to be a long-term member of the Greyhound Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
To be able to tell a believable story, one has to know something about the trade, as well as having good intentions to promote nature and friendship between man and dog.
That did not work in this case.
It's too much erotica for a good family movie, and there's not enough feeling for the genre.
This amateurish piece would not even make a good advert for canine therapy.
Yeah, respect, because they have to listen to all the abuse from idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, and here you can see how well you understand it, but it's only because you haven't tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want it, then the answer will always be no.
If you listened to this kind of music all the time, you might change your mind.
It's just like any other job, in this case, it's a way to earn some extra cash.
The Middle East is experiencing unusually dry months.
In fact, winter is the only season when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall in November, as we have seen in some stations, is unusual," said Israel's Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of its long-term average rainfall for the month of November.
This week's two-day deluge was therefore more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
This is the right festive backdrop, Wasím Aškar, a resident of Nazareth, said.
Rainfall in Israel is almost entirely confined to the winter months, and is sporadic and irregular.
Winter rainfall depends on the forests.
They dry out without them and are prone to catch fire.
It's not just about forests, it's also about water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, has filled to the brim this spring after three wet winters.
Since then, levels have been falling.
Water managers warned about the threat of drought a long time ago.
"It is expected that in light of global warming and climate change, there will be a decrease in rainfall here," said Uri Schor, spokesperson for Israel's Water Authority, back in 2018.
Israel has the know-how to use technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
It is worse for economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the Jordanian capital Amman, the number of tanker trucks is increasing in the streets.
The water supply and private wells are drying up.
"This year, the orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years," said Imad Suleiman, a tanker driver, in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes between farmers and security forces.
The cause of the protests was the drought.
The channel of the local river was left completely without water.
The region has seen its driest November in many years.
Israel plans military strike on Iran
The Israeli Defense Minister stated that the talks in Vienna had not brought "any progress" and that he had briefed Washington about the plans to attack Iran's nuclear facilities.
Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz on Saturday ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a possible military strike on Iran, Jonathan Lis reported.
Gantz, who is in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to increase pressure on Iran, while also updating Washington on the military buildup.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had not brought "any progress" and that the world powers "understand that Iranians are playing with them."
About 3 years ago, I also had this happen to me.
I put some pressure on her and grilled her a bit during the conversation to find out what she really wanted.
In the end, I found out that my suspicion about the pyramid was correct.
Because I really don't like this kind of behaviour, I continued to harass the young lady with doubts and questions, and in the end, I thanked her and left.
Tell me that I am a robber, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers went to the mountains over the weekend. There was enough snow and good weather
The ski resorts in the Czech Republic saw the first big wave of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the week, there is no lack of snow and some ski resorts have opened thanks to this.
The skiers were not deterred by the obligation to present a Covid certificate at the ski lifts.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about a lack of customers, some ski hire companies are reporting a fall in demand compared to before the pandemic.
Thousands of people went to the cross-country skiing trails and ski slopes over the weekend in the Liberec region.
The skiers were lucky with the weather, which provided sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are happy, the opening weekend has really worked out, starting with the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the slopes," said Jakub Hanuš, Director of the Sport Areál Ještěd.
Hundreds of people headed for the first weekend of skiing in the new season in the Jeseníky Mountains.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or the centre in Branná, Šumperk, were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people visiting on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so it was perfect, said the representative of the Branná ski resort, Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell a ski pass to people who are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 in the last 180 days.
People are prepared for this and are showing the necessary documents, said René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre to ČTK.
"We have seen only a handful of incidents," he said.
Some ski hire shops and ski equipment retailers are reporting a fall in demand compared to before the pandemic.
There is demand for ski rentals, thankfully.
It is not the same as in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
There is a higher demand during skiing courses.
David Šinták, the managing director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, also feels that the lack of interest in renting ski equipment due to Covid has had an impact on his business.
At that time, before the pandemic, we were already almost fully booked.
We are at about 50 percent compared to the period before the pandemic, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people have become depressed during the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
By contrast, the Novako hire centre in Boží Dar is experiencing a surge in demand.
Ski rentals started there a week ago and it is now necessary to book in advance.
"We will start lending out cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already been calling ahead, so we are expecting a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the ski resort's manager.
She said that there is also an interest in the ski school, which is comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay in the country, we have to give them the opportunity to live a high-quality life like they do abroad.
This does not include the socialist healthcare system, where it is not uncommon to not be able to find a dentist or specialised doctor.
People with intelligence and skills go abroad, and they don't have any property here.
The owner of the company is not going to go abroad just like that.
I completely agree with the rest of it.
If these people do not feel that they can live well in the Czech Republic, and if they do not see a reasonable future for themselves in the Czech Republic, then they will not live in the Czech Republic.
Migration from Hungary started when Orbán won an election one fine day, ruled for a year, and suddenly there was a surge of tens of thousands of people leaving the country.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic could not find itself in a similar position overnight.
It all depends on the elections.
If things go wrong here, then some traditional V4 psychopath might win.
The young and the well-educated will leave, but his supporters and those who cannot fit their property into a plane will stay.
This is a gruesome photo!
Langmajer in the blood because of a bet on beer?
While it was autumn in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor had posted a gruesome photo of his bloodied face on social networks.
Is it a real injury, or is it make-up for the shoot?
The Metropolitan Police are still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is completely out of character and we are all very worried," said Lucy O'Connor, of Lambeth police, in a video released on Saturday.
"Her family back in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just want to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell area.
The last sighting was about an hour later, in a bus.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on December 3.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant nurse" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
"We are very worried about our colleague, Petra, who is missing," said the group of health facilities on Twitter.
"We are appealing for anyone who may have any information which may assist in locating her to contact us," it said.
The MP, Harriet Harman, who spoke out about Srncová's case at a press conference on Saturday, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"She has been missing for days now, she is only 32, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably distraught," the Labour MP said, holding up a photo of the woman circulated by the Metropolitan Police.
"I feel like all of us have a particular responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, and she was working here in our health care system," Harman said.
Police have previously detained a man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police did not provide any information about the man's identity or about what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
These are not "huge numbers", but ca 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice how Ukraine keeps saying that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion, that we are wearing them out with our constant talk about it.
I was quoted out of context.
I don't know what he thought about Russia wanting the war.
War is a very expensive joke, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The situation is so much better than it was in 1938 that I don't know where to start.
I can compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can imagine that, after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk Agreement, Russia will annex the ridiculous republics.
That is all, and that is how the "concentration" at the border fits in.
It's all about keeping one's promises...
New timetables have been introduced in Prague since Sunday, mainly for commuter services
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport System (PID) can look forward to several changes from Sunday, which mainly affect commuter connections.
New lines have been opened, some routes have been changed, and others have been closed.
Mladá Boleslav is now connected to the integrated system.
Since Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop in Zahradní Město in the capital.
In the commuter rail service, S7 trains will run on the line from Beroun to Český Brod, passing through Prague's main railway station.
In the recently opened station in Prague-Zahradní Město, the R17 fast train from České Budějovice and Benešov will be stopping for the first time.
The PID is to be expanded to other areas.
Buses will go as far as Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines that cross into the Liberec and Královéhradecký regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and the operation of 12 lines will be changed.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Zličín in Prague and go all the way to Žatec.
There has also been a new direct line from Prague to Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
Peak services in the morning and at weekends will be strengthened, and a new express line, number 404, will be launched between Prague and Rakovník.
The PID system now includes lines 400 and 410, which go to the Liberec region.
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice metro station.
Line 400 goes via Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, and some selected trains continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Line 410 travels via Mělník, Dubá and Dokšice, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the contrary, the operation on the ten středočesk local railways has been cancelled or reduced, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, there are ongoing long-term disruptions on the lines between Prague and Beroun, Prague and Lysá nad Labem and in the area around Kolín.
Passengers can also look forward to other changes.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines, or the 420 line is being extended with a connection in Prague, so that it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 and 543 in Nymburk have been changed, and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Horovice in the Pilsen region have been adjusted.
A healthy snack/lunch at the office from the supermarket
Hi, I work 9 to 5 with a 30-minute break, and my only option to get food is to go to Billy's or a Lidl nearby.
Since I do not have any movement, after work I do not have the strength to exercise, so I have to eat as healthy and dietically as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and in a rush, I can only get a pizza base and some yoghurt and fruit for a snack.
Question: what would you recommend, in terms of healthy food that doesn't need to be cooked, that I could buy in a supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a foot of snow like you do, unfortunately.
It's not about the trees you have to see.
Only the tip of the tree might be covered in snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal infections.
I'm not saying that this is the only reason why we are not allowed to go off-piste, but it is one of the reasons.
Dary's admission about her relationship with Nedvěd: I was not looking forward to it at all
The Czech showbiz pond has been living only for the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved since Friday.
They have been together since the summer, and the famous football player even got a divorce for the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to fans, explaining why she kept her love a secret for half a year.
"I can say with confidence that there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would not know that Dara has caught a bear, sorry, I mean Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player.
He allegedly dumped her, not the other way around.
Three days are the centre of attention, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
This is what we didn't want to happen, but we knew it would, the singer continued.
I don't know who is worse off.
Whether it's people who don't care about it at all, and it pops up on them even from a can, or whether it's our lives, which are examined down to the smallest detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you are compatible with your spouse or your partner, or whether you insist on everyone knowing the list of your ex-partners and being aware of your mistakes and shortcomings.
It's a slang word, and Darja doesn't like it.
The pair met in Italy, where Rolins was preparing her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been Vice President of Juventus Football Club for a long time.
They came out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for Nedvěd's divorce to be finalised.
They have been separated from their wife, Ivana, for three years, but they have only been apart on paper for three weeks.
In any case, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, with families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man, and I am standing by him, just like he is standing by me, in good times and bad, Rolins concluded.
Hi, other commenters have probably said everything important already, but I can confirm that the dorms are great at the beginning. Most of my classmates got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two, and then found roommates together, which I think is the best option, because you know who you will be living with.
Apartments are not advertised for a long time in advance, so at the moment you will not find much, but it won't do any harm to take a look at the offer.
Otherwise, try to avoid Cejl and its surroundings (e.g. Vranovská, Francouzská, etc.), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
By contrast, Veveří is very student-friendly, Královo Pole is good too, and it is close to most of the VUT faculties (I don't know exactly where you are based).
I have never looked for a flat, but I am a Brno native, so I can give you some information about Brno if you need it.
This is an example of "normal" thinking.
The fact that a number of doctors somewhere in Poland have made a decision means that it is perfectly acceptable for the state not to provide sufficient funding for some schools.
Either they can learn what they want to and pay for it themselves, or they can go to state-run schools and the state will pay for it.
We cannot allow a private actor to control a part of the education system just because he adds a few crowns to the full-fledged state contribution so that he can teach whatever he wants in schools.
This statement is somewhat weakened by the fact that it was written by a person who, two days previously, had expressed himself in this way about a petition calling for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So, is a vote against abortion for you the same as a vote against a statue in a square?
I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job in the first place.
Otherwise, I have experienced that (and this applies even to long-term professionals) either they just guess or they write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) in the note that it is illegible.
It is true that it is quite legible in this case, so I would not really recommend it.
Personally, I would probably handle it in a note, depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a good and hard-working student, you can look in some symbol databases and find the closest match.
However, because it looks like you are quoting from a book, I would guess that the author or the printer simply invented their own symbol, which was appropriate for what was on the coin.
PS: Isn't it more like the Odrya (kingdom) than the Odra?
PSS: Someone has already figured this out for you.

Politicians have no clue what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
This is much worse than if they have to have an interpreter with them.
The idea that something will be passed because nobody understands a text is laughable.
All important documents are analysed line by line, and it is not enough to have a basic knowledge of English. This is the job of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions. English is more useful for informal contacts and establishing extra-professional relationships.
In addition, it is quite interesting with the English language now that GB is leaving the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Cejl.
I have been working there for the third year and I am completely fine.
I go home from work at 10:00 p.m. and there are never any problems.
Only someone who has never set foot in a ghetto can say that it is a ghetto.
Yes, most of the Romani population of Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is block the sidewalk and the park with their cars: I'm certainly not afraid to go out on the street there at night.
So if you are looking for relatively inexpensive accommodation with good transport links to the city centre, then I would definitely go for it.
A lot of flats there are newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and his girlfriend Gelemová!
Where will they be spending Christmas?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on their Advent wreaths, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dády wreath, and Lucie certainly has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and their two grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: AGAIN TOGETHER!
But we still talked, so we didn't have a Christmas.
I have no clue where I'm going to be.
I buy gifts throughout the year and I will definitely buy something to Dada and Lucie, maybe perfume.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who came to the launch of the music video in the Richman club himself.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel lonely.
I will always find someone to talk to, says Slováček, who was happy to meet the wife of Luděk Sobota, Adrian, or the singer Kamila Nývltová.
He made it clear.
We are Iceland, and we can afford not to have soldiers or weapons?
I don't think anyone is going to stand in our way, and our location is so strategic that it would take a complete idiot not to occupy that territory.
I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, can you explain to me why?
I do not know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are not enough policemen, and they cannot afford it, so the firefighters are the only ones with such a high percentage of medically trained people.
The fact that our army is capable of defending Ostrava alone is a headache for previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.
A record-breaking drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies. The landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
Czechia is experiencing its worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the amount of water has decreased in mountainous and foothill areas. The amount of precipitation has also decreased in areas where there was no need for water before.
The cause of the drought, which is affecting a large part of Central Europe, is climate change.
The impact is, however, reinforced by the way we manage the soil.
What should we be prepared for in terms of drought?
What can we do to help nature in these difficult times?
It will be like that, I can hardly stay on my skates on the ice, I know nothing about playing ice hockey, and the tactics (which I have tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also a complete mess.
Whether you're playing for Team Russia (the "Bears") or Team China (the "Turtles"), it's a different experience to lose by two goals, even if you didn't win the game.
However, as I listen to the Czech commentators, who point out what the referees are not paying attention to, whether in men's or women's ice hockey, it is all very strange, but that is probably how it is with all sports. UEFA and "Italian actors" or motor sports, F1, WRC, etc.
This is a controversial issue.
A, in my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be as it always is. That is, that the Czech Republic has lost more often than it has won, and it would be a classic "they lost" versus "we won".
Coronavirus: Russia reports more than 10 million Covid-19 cases
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 new daily cases.
There are 5,766 people hospitalized.
In total, there were 34,451 deaths in the Czech Republic, with a further 74.
In the Czech Republic, there are 1967 confirmed cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the last 14 days, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
Russia has reported more than 10 million coronavirus cases as of Sunday.
There were 29,929 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the past 24 hours.
This is the lowest daily figure since 13 October.
The total number of registered cases of coronavirus in Russia is 1,001,689.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest it has been since the end of October.
The UK is facing a "substantial" outbreak of the Omicron variant, the country's chief medical officer has said, speaking to Sky News on Sunday.
We will need to re-introduce quarantine measures.
Individuals infected with the omicron variant are already being hospitalized in the UK, and Hopkins is expecting the number to grow.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations are about fourteen days after infection, and deaths are about three weeks after infection.
Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, said on Sunday that Boris Johnson may have breached the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December, when lockdown measures were in place and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister in Johnson's government argued that the quiz had taken place "virtually," on a computer.
However, it was done in Downing Street by groups of staff huddled around computers.
There is growing pressure in the UK to remove Johnson from office.
Last December, when London was in a strict lockdown and Christmas parties were banned, Mr Johnson's ministers flouted the rules and held a slew of boozy gatherings.
The British public and the media are livid that Johnson and his government have made a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's head of news in the UK: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is discussing whether he should be removed from the office of Prime Minister.
It's remarkable how quickly events have unfolded.
Do you want to turn things around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections next spring, which could end Viktor Orban's twelve years in power.
This will be an election of European significance.
How much can you really expect them to be fair?
They will not be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because they were not free even in the last two elections under Orbán.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes electoral districts in order to benefit from it, and does other small or big tricks.
The latest one sounds like this: Everyone can choose where they want to vote in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to bring voters from safe constituencies to those that are uncertain, where the opposition might have a chance of winning.
So I just want to reiterate that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
It's a completely different situation.
It used to be about whether Fidesz would win, and by how much, and whether it would have an absolute majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will go to the united opposition.
This is something new for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they become even more ruthless in their efforts to stay in power?
Yes, we have some hints that they are willing to go beyond what they have done before.
Recently, an audio recording of László Kövér, Chairman of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, was leaked to the independent media, in which he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
What are the signs of this new approach you speak of?
Yes, that is one of the new features.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite a lot, the last time was when I was 14, my parents are not very patient, I am not either, my dad has been around for a long time, but then he snaps (in relation to me).
I am also very choleric and I used to get very angry as a child, to the extent that I would lie on the ground in convulsions and turn blue, and they had to wash me twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they scolded me, sometimes it was more like that they did not know what to do.
Certainly, I have a tendency to resolve things violently now, as a little girl I fought a lot, now I punch something to vent my frustration, and as a younger person I used to hit my parents on the arm (so that I wouldn't get a slap on the face), so nothing extreme, but I always have this urge.
I can't really say to what extent my explosiveness is caused by my upbringing, but it definitely has something to do with it.
I am afraid that I will also lose my patience with my children and deal with it in the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong, and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that time, when it was no longer "educational," but rather out of frustration, on the other hand, it is probably impossible not to mess up your children at all, so I can't really blame them for it.
I am not offended by it, I do not understand why he should be ashamed of it.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call those people who make laws of such a high quality "kundamis".
Otherwise, I would like to know whether you are afraid of a drop in income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying your product so that you can repay your mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia go with the trial of journalist Kuciak's killers?
In Slovakia, the main trial in the case of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of an investigative journalist and his partner has changed Slovakia.
It has mobilised the civil society, but it has also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the Slovak political and judicial elites.
How significant will this process be for Slovakia?
This is a big deal for journalists.
How is it possible that this petition received much more media attention than the counter-petition of deans of all medical faculties, which was published a day or two later?
No, they got carried away and the company jumped on the bandwagon.
A year ago, Covid-19 was still killing people on Czech television.
Another government is ending, and there is no place in the law for the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a repository
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end, and the law, which was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of local communities and their citizens in the selection and approval of a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Government Legislative Council has suspended the debate on the proposal, which has been languishing for years, after being presented to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is in serious disagreement not only with the Platform against deep geological repositories, but also with the Union of Municipalities and Towns of the Czech Republic.
The self-governments are expecting a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers, as was promised to them back in 2011, when work on this legislation started, and which is also stipulated by the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in line with its coalition agreement, to revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The proposed legislation by Minister Karel Havlíček, which the Platform has in its possession, is criticised by the municipalities in particular for the following reasons: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the location of a repository is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of the municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only really be effective if the communities or the public can actually influence whether the process continues in a particular location.
This can be achieved by making it a requirement of the Radioactive Waste Management Authority to seek the approval of the relevant communities before starting the process.
The proposed draft of the "substantive intent" practically ignores the public's involvement and makes the citizens of the municipalities mere statistics in the process of granting permits.
The proposal does not include a system-wide compensation scheme for councils for the whole process of searching and selecting a site, its approval and operation.
In reality, under current legislation, local authorities have little power to champion the interests of their communities when it comes to finding a site for a repository.
In some approval procedures, applicants may lodge an appeal or request a review, but the decision is made by the authority or the minister in whose interest the approval is granted.
Any legal action will not have a suspending effect on the carrying out of surveying or building works.
The co-decision of local authorities, which Platform demands, is a principle that is commonly used in many democratic countries, and certainly in those that are further ahead in the process of siting a repository, such as Sweden and Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which outsources the preparation of legislation to external law firms.
This is a contract with HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o. law firm, which was signed by SÚRAO, and which builds on the contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total sum for these works is to be around CZK 4 million, according to the register of contracts.
Antonín Seknička, the deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and a spokesman for the Platform Against Deep Geological Repository for Highly Radioactive Waste said: After the Ministers of Industry, who only postponed the issue of the search for a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we are waiting for a significant turnaround from the new government.
We are ready to lend a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Union of Municipalities and Towns for its support. The Union of Municipalities and Towns has a similar view to that of the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations with regard to the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a fundamental building.
Platform against deep geological repositories unites 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to dealing with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep geological repositories.
The platform is pushing for the selection of locations for possible storage sites to be conditional on the prior agreement of the local community.
John Goodman, 69, was scared into losing weight: He shed 90 pounds.
Despite his long-standing reluctance to change his lifestyle, he eventually gave in to pressure from doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight he would die.
It worked.
Goodman lost 90kg, which is half of his original weight of 180kg, the Sun reported.
At the premiere of the new animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles, he boasted about his new character.
From fat sitcom star to completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family had pleaded with him to lose weight, as his large body caused all his furniture to creak.
"I would put everything in my mouth," the actor said in an interview with AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
To move, to exercise.
I'm now at an age where I can't afford to sit back and do nothing, he told ABC Goodman, whose transformation is incredible.
It also depends on which boss you are fighting and how you want to use the word "boss".
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming community, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text, such as a university essay, I would probably look for ways to describe or explain the boss.
There are multiple types of bosses in this game.
For example, in a game like Dark Souls, there are several bosses, yes, and so "boss" is something like the lord / ruler of a certain level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are secret bosses (or super bosses, or hidden bosses), which are not required to beat in order to complete the game or level, but are often far stronger than the standard boss.
Are there games like Half-Life, where the bosses are there, but the player doesn't have to fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua)?
And then there are mini-bosses.
Basically, it is not possible to translate the word boss into English in one word. Czech and other languages do not deal with this issue (it is interesting that Catalan translates the word boss as the final enemy).
It is simply important for the story or the game in general, a computer-controlled opponent stronger than all previous ones, guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for Petra, who has been missing from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also got involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherské Hradiště has been missing since December 7.
Through Interpol, it helps the British police.
The last time her colleagues saw Petra Srncová, a Czech, was on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol has issued a red notice for her.
The whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police cooperates closely with the British police," confirmed the police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We are sharing information about the case," she said.
The search for Petra has been announced on the police website.
He says she is 168 centimetres tall, slim, with brown eyes and long, straight brown hair.
It is said to originate from Uherský Brod.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried as this is very unusual for her
MP Harriet Harman has also helped find Petra.
She was involved in putting up posters with Petra's face on them.
"We are worried sick about it," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In relation to the disappearance, the British police have already detained one suspect.
However, it is not clear who they are referring to or what they have in common with Petra.
Christmas in the Czech Republic is terrorised by Agent Tesla.
While the data for October pointed to a slight fall in the number of attacks, last month saw a resurgence in cyber-attacks with the approach of the end of the year.
A big campaign in relation to Agent Tesla was recorded on 18th November.
The attacks are deliberately targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same.
The infected attachment in the email is designed to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
Last month, the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its name, but this time it was called "Copie oprav účtenky za 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malware actively searches for stored login credentials and then sends them to the attackers.
The last big campaign happened in the Czech Republic at the end of August and beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the attackers' activity is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic in this case, and security specialists detected a more global campaign in November.
Compared to the data from Formbook in October, it has weakened slightly in November, but it is still responsible for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks happened continuously throughout the month, with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th, and 15th.
Formbook contained a file with the most common extension .exe, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the term ‘účtenka’ is still used.
In other words, a file in Czech may be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts are reporting a significant drop in activity and de-escalation for the Fareit programme, which accounted for 1.6 per cent of attacks and had not seen a major campaign in the Czech Republic for several months.
Today's demo of clever people who don't need oxygen because they've been vaccinated.
The march in Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the waterfront and my experience as a demonstrator, I estimate around 10,000 people.
People in the parade filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously joined the march of about four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
Whether the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led them to find a common language.
Only a small group of antivaxxers, antirouškaři and others would be able to fill such a large procession, let alone pay for it.
The actions of the group Chcípl pes are gaining popularity, it reminds me of Milión chvilek pro demokracii upside down.
I sometimes get the impression that they are renting the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say which movement will come out of this discontent. It depends not only on funding, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will become a four-dose or more-dose vaccine.
It will certainly not be a left-wing or centrist movement, put your money on it.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is obvious that we will need to be re-vaccinated every six months.
I am very happy that we have been saved by the vaccines.
A genius act by scientists, for which humanity has the right to be proud.
The End of the Road: Bulgaria Has a New Prime Minister, Vowing Change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement Continue the Change with forming a new government, which won the November elections.
It has managed to form a coalition government, which will take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections due to anti-corruption protests.
The victorious anti-graft and anti-misuse of power candidates, however, failed to reach a consensus, so there were two by-elections.
What do cats do when nobody is looking?
From "secret" footage, a global hit.
In the UK over the weekend, there were growing fears for the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been missing for several days and who was being sought by the London police.
The last sighting of Petra Srncová was two weeks ago, when she was cycling home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, the woman's former employer and the London Member of Parliament for the area she lived in have also been contacted for information.
"The disappearance of Petra is completely out of character and we are all very worried," said Lucy O'Connor, of Lambeth police, in a video released on Saturday.
"Her family back in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just want to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell area.
The last sighting was about an hour later, in a bus.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on December 3.
According to British media, Srncová worked as an "assistant nurse" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.
"We are very worried about our colleague, Petra, who is missing," said the group of health facilities on Twitter.
"We are appealing for anyone who may have any information which may assist in locating her to contact us," it said.
The Šumper amatuer painter of children's rooms, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also the regional Pirate Councilor) was reported anonymously for copyright infringement by her murals.
However, the court found that the Krteček paintings in the Šumperk apartments did not breach the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road for a month in the form of a channel without a lid,
It was touch and go.
The Magistrate referred the complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which is the owner of the road, but it did not react, so the hole just got bigger.
The authorities finally clarified responsibility and ownership, and after a month the Road and Motorway Directorate started to "deal with the situation".
