The great return of the Czech smoker is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech ice hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, returns to the NHL.
The 30--year-old Plzeň native will be on the bench and could soon find himself in goal..
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or Russian Chelyabinsk suffered an injury during the preparation for the NHL in October last year.
Exactly in the middle of the game against Vegas, he was substituted and has not appeared on the ice of the NHL since then.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one goalpost to the other.
Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury to his lower body, the Denver team announced at the beginning of October.
HIs return to the NHL lasted more than two months.
In the morning of Sunday American time, he was called from the farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he recorded 94.5% of his saves.
A product of the Plzeň hockey academy, he wants to finally prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In the last season he had problems with his knees and in the shortened pandemic season he did not play a single match..
In the NHL, "Francík" pitched 36 games, his success rate was 92.3%..
Charles wears a mask on his Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan.
The British prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas greeting this year.
Prince Charles also published his wish, using a photograph on which his wife Camilla helps him to put on a mask.
On its website, the British news agency BBC reported on this..
Wishes are sent to friends, co--workers and foundations with which they cooperate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert..
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and the dress also has Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a shirt with a necktie, just like Prince George and Prince Louis.
The photographer was not identified, and William and Kate did not say when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas greeting in front of a bundle of straw before a pile of logs in their country estate in the county of Norfolk.
The picture that serves as a Christmas greeting was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles with his wife Camilla.
Photos of Sam Hussein were taken in June at the racecourse in Ascot..
Charles, who is wearing a cylinder on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask that matches her white dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbrov a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – in the current corruption scandal, the criminal investigators apparently worked with the assumption that the former vice president of the Football Association of Czech Republic Roman Berbr had been promised one million Czech crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season by Slavia from Prague.
Efotbal.cz reported this with the information that he had access to a part of the police files.
The chairman of the Vršovac club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the club did not engage in any corrupt practices.
The server published the transcripts of the police recordings, in which Slavia's former sporting director Jan Nezmar features prominently. Nezmar left the club in the summer of 2017.
The former influential functionary of the red--white team was, according to the dossier, in frequent contact with both Berbrem and the former sports director of then second- division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz,, who is also implicated in the case.
Criminal investigators apparently worked with the information that Slavia Berbrovi had promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the team of SK Slavia Prague won the first league title.
The police force was aware of the fact that Roman ( Berbr ) was to receive a million-aire bribe from the Slavia ( Prague ) club officials, according to the court documents.
The next day, according to the police,, Berbr met not only with Nezmare, but also with Slavia chairman Tvrdik.
It is not known whether the police are still investigating on the basis of this information.
Tvrdik rejected any corrupt conduct.
In the years 2015 to 2017, they actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
They have never committed an illegal act, have not attempted to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and no one has received any financial compensation in this context.
In the reruns, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former Slavia players of dark skin and also maligns his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged influence on matches through referees was sparked by a police raid on several locations, including the FAČR's headquarters in Prague, in mid- October last year.
The highest--ranking figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any of the football functions.
In mid- January, the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and BVPs are larping the Cold War.
The artillery will be new, but of a fundamentally worse type ( the gunners have to fire from armored cabins and carry ammunition manually without protection )
Cars - Toyoty hi-lux – are new and good.
Tanks and various armored vehicles – at a decent level,, in addition, the Pragy V3S has already been eliminated from the specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - good, but at the end of the lease, transport – too small with short range but modern.
Drones – small and only with limited combat potential.
Rackets – we don't have them at all (but they are manufactured and exported to foreign countries)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
There is a mine right next to the city..
Nutria came out of the river and damaged the crops, so I was sitting there.
When he arrived, he saw that on the other side of the river there was a fisherman.
He didn't want to make a mess, so he sat down quietly and the guy didn't notice him.
I hoped that it would go away before anything came out, but, of course, a fox came out shortly afterwards..
He let her come to 40 metres before deciding to shoot.
The unfortunate fisherman waved his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before he got out of the saddle, he was done for..
That is to say, a man's lawn can be pruned.
On the other hand, it is not a war, it would have to be the result of a number of coincidences for something to happen, and it is likely that he would have been seen by thermal imaging, which is used by almost everyone today.
So, on a visible place, expensive things should be placed near the feet in the sleeping bag and he should be at ease.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Interior Ministry bought respirators at a much lower price than the Ministry of Health.
The state, responsible for purchasing and distributing masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of koruna on their procurement in recent weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the prices of respirators varied by hundreds of crowns on a single day.
Why the prices changed so dramatically.
Whose offices behaved in a frugal manner.
And why others paid more.
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with Dominika Kubishtova, a reporter for the iRozhlas website.
Soldiers and armies are respected ( perhaps not affected by memories of the ČSLA, which the older generation benefited from ), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
Ne only do they not have large warehouses of modern equipment that could be used by the newly trained troops, they do not even have modern equipment for the existing professionals, in addition, modern equipment is becoming increasingly more complicated, so the skills of the reservists will rapidly decline over time.
In addition to the modern conventional conflicts,, where it is possible to deploy whoever, they will take place very quickly and there is no time to train someone again.
And finally, the reservists / territorial defense have great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrilla warfare is possible and it is also a necessity to intimidate the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the only way to fight is in a conflict of such a scale and intensity, where even guerrilla warfare is irrelevant, and there is no suitable geography for it.
the main thing is that they don't have any individual skills.
And that is not the worst..
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it..
And then such situations occur, that the guy, who 2 minutes ago missed the empty goal, rushes into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss players and says to himself "that's it and what he thinks will happen now. "
Of course, he will not be elected as a representative of the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to provoke the defender" is so terrible that he was honestly surprised when he saw that the team's attacker managed to outwit one player from the opposing team.
The first swallows.
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major breakthroughs in the coming weeks.
The pressure on hospitals, according to statistical models, will continue for some time, and a new unknown factor has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty that it can cause a more serious course of the disease, as vaccination or post--infection immunity gained from a previous infection can help against it.
However, this week the covid equation also included an unexpected phenomenon on the side of the pluses: the possibility of treatment..
A new antiviral drug, molnupiravir, arrived in Czechia, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and hospitalization by a third, and it is possible to treat it at home.
Paxlovid, developed by Pfizer, is expected to be added to the arsenal soon, with a reported success rate of 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to Czechia, in addition to the hope of expanding the arsenal of useful tools in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, highlighted the question of how the administration is prepared for the arrival of new drugs.
First, molnupiravir from the Merck company will be delivered to domestic patients.
The company was the first to develop the vaccine long before the outbreak of the current pandemic with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for viral diseases of horses in South America.
In these studies, it is often overlooked that people in the West ( Germany, Sweden, etc. )
In general, they are less open and less willing to share their opinions..
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially the Czechs, are used to speaking "as their beaks grew".
When he conducts research, he asks people whether they like Muslims.
In Czech, most people say no directly.
In the West, they say that they love migration, that everyone should help them, and that the Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD..
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their job and being subjected to a media lynching.
And in the surveys, it looks good, the west is good, the east is bad.
and find out what people really think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have more than 20 % according to polls.
In addition, it is known that the objects are three in number and completely identical.
This is the same reason for the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to relearn where everything is again. As a result, all the buildings are identical.
One is the Atom Muzeum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
It is funny that the SSSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory for reasons of safety or speed of deployment due to its more western location.
In the underground bunkers ( there are two in each javelin ) only the warheads were stored, not the entire missiles as is said.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit was sent, which picked up this head and attached it to some kind of carrying device.
In addition to the museum's javelin, the remaining ones are in a deplorable state.
In the second grade of elementary school, he had a classmate Cigána, for 4 years.
He was in a good mood, he made good jokes, he often went too far, but he was the team's mascot.
He was talked to by everyone, he often went there and wanted to explain something, he lacked little, he went there regularly, he devoted himself to sports with them, he did not steal snacks or phones, he went there cleanly dressed.
He also went to summer camps, did all sorts of monkey tricks, but was always good-natured., he never had any mishaps..
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings and gypsies entered the same class.
Sometime later, they beat up the teacher, there was often trouble with the police, they threatened and intimidated other students.
Personally, he sometimes sells something on an advertisement ( old things, things he does not need, etc. ) and he has already sold Cigáns many times, he always had money, he did not try to cheat him on the price and the communication was calm.
E.g. he even sold a car in this way, and a month later the guy called him to say that he had already transferred the ownership of the car to himself..
He himself says that he is not a racist, that he does not care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other color, as long as he behaves in a way that is appropriate in a civilized society ( works, functions, does not beat women, etc. ).
And if someone comes, stretches out their hand, takes apart apartments and houses, there is only chaos around him, he causes problems. It doesn't matter what color he has, but it will bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants as long as they stay in the country and start working, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English) and respect the country's culture.
As long as they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs..
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice.
"A young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts she died at the scene, the spokeswoman for the South Bohemian emergency medical services, Zuzana Fajtlová said.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was carrying the girl..
The 18- year old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was travelling in the direction of the village of Žíchovec towards the village of Bavorov and, for unknown reasons, drove in the wrong direction in a bend.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof outside the road, said the spokeswoman of the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of a Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
He suffered multiple injuries and was trapped in the vehicle.
After he was freed, he had to receive emergency pre--hospital care and, in a stable condition, was airlifted to the Budějovice hospital, said the rescue worker Fajtlová.
He added that the man in the second carriage suffered minor injuries to his chest and was taken to hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often do not provide information about them.
Lukas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
"Usually, it can be tens of dollars, for example from ten dollars upwards, where it still makes sense to import from Japan, where the post is often free of charge,, " the collector explains.
Since October, the cost of ordering small parcels has increased slightly, they must now add VAT and hand over data for customs clearance to the post office.
He receives an e-mail informing him that customs officers expect the arrival of a package.
Then, the shipper has to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the importer did not pay DPH at the time of purchase, the customs authority will levy it from the total value of the shipment and transportation.
In the event that the recipient does not carry out the customs clearance on his own, he must add to the total amount also the transportation fee.
However, according to Lukas Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
One or two ticking boxes, two attachments, and it's done..
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all deliveries, however, go smoothly..
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of packages received from abroad at the international post office in Prague fell from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests to provide information necessary for the completion of customs procedures.
At the moment, there are 30,000 parcels on the international post that have to be processed.
If people filled in all the necessary information and did it in time, they would be about halfway through, according to Czech Post spokesman Matyas Vitik.
Solving inflation
As the title suggests, this is how they would have proposed a solution to the current inflation.
Currently, the inflation rate is at 9.9 percent and it is expected to rise further.
What he thinks the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth.
For example, the reduction of VAT on food and fuel in Poland, this is the way to go for them.
What they think will happen, what is inevitable with where it is heading.
Wages are growing faster than prices, according to me, it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
For example, if they received 100,000 yen, they were paid 100,000 yen.
This year, they added 2% to his salary, which is a slap in the face, but fortunately he has a similar income from his business, which he operates while employed.
Someone would be able to explain to me why those who have been proven guilty of violence are sentenced to only 6 months in prison..
I can't understand how a court can sentence such an animal to only 6 months in jail only because it did it again as soon as it got out.
6 months is nothing in comparison to the fact that his or her victim will suffer trauma for several years, negatively affecting his or her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
And that's not to mention the fact that the victim of rape may never recover from that..
This does not apply to potential future reports of rape by victims.
The man from Hrobo " burned " his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The man from Hrobo unintentionally helped the police to detain his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was issued with an arrest warrant.
He called for her himself.
But he went about it in a roundabout way.
He first approached passers-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After being called in by the emergency line, the guards arrived at the scene and could not believe their eyes when the alleged " robbed " told them that he made up the whole story to get the guards to come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted advice from the police officers on how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the guards discovered that the woman is on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide manhunt, and has a detention order issued against her.
The case is being investigated by the police.
An honest question for people here, whether they consider their country to be Slavic.
Personally, I believe that the Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally Slavic, but I would like to know their opinion.
Otherwise, he agrees with the memem, which is a shame that Churchill did not succeed in securing the liberation of Prague for the United States.
Of course, he does not deny that they have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it is quite a question whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it might potentially bring benefit.
A case like this, I would not consider to be the true faith..
Pascale, on the other hand, cannot agree with this, there are estimated to be around 10,000 different religions in the world.
Whose god or gods a person then chooses to worship.
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who punishes those who believe in a different god.
However, in the Ten Commandments, it is stated that there is no other god but Jahwe's.
In such a case, it would therefore be more rational to refrain from believing in any god, than to risk choosing the wrong god from among the thousands of gods and ending up in purgatory or some other similar place as a result.
Others: Voluntary training and subsequent placement in the reserve.
The Swiss model is probably similar.
X months of training ( in different specializations, X months on one ) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person does well, they may receive a professional offer.
All AČR units would benefit from something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the Military University.
It is possible to say that there is constant talk about the cooperation between the educational sector and the industry, companies hunt in schools and there is a kind of interweaving of labor force, which migrates from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another and so on.
A similar overlapping should also occur between the civilian and military sectors.
He also sees it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, which is an institution that guarantees that no Russian, German or Mongolian invader will ever invade here again.
I find it amusing that they consider NATO to be something carved in stone, they have allies and they will therefore defend themselves if things go wrong.
I do not please the Lord..
All it takes is one election in the United States to crunch their budget and the whole NATO goes down..
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas and the Poles have already shown that they are satisfied with showing their backs and taking what they want.
The only long--term guarantee of sovereignty is a well--armed army and a population that knows how to operate the military technology of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remotely controlled devices, so why not..
We don't need a border fortification, that's obsolete today, but a teenager with a remote--controlled device can deal with it..
Surviving the box tsunami
Unwrapping gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly being overwhelmed by boxes and fillings.
This "waste" is used again by e--shops, which lack packaging materials.
As a result, a map of shops was created that welcomed the recycled cardboard boxes.
It is not only during the holidays.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
As a result, it is a shame to treat them as one--time waste.
Anybody can bring to the participating shops ( there are nearly 150 of them on the KAMsNIM.CZ map ) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste produced and also avoid overcrowded blue bins.
The shops welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply, as well as the saved money, since packaging cardboard has increased in price by 50 % over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, this also strengthens its brand..
One of these businesses is Tierra Verde, a manufacturer of ecological detergents and ecological cosmetics.
Boxes and packing material are delivered to Popůvek near Brno by individuals, who accumulate them at home,, but firms, with whom they have agreed on regular deliveries of discarded cardboard, also turn up..
All of this is used when packing parcels from the company's e--shop.
Thanks to the efforts of individuals and companies, the world is becoming a more considerate place.
Their wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The website www.KAMsNIM.CZ, however, does not only show collection points for waste packaging.
It serves as a search engine if one needs to get rid of something ( where to dispose of waste from the home, where to hand in expired medicines, tyres, obsolete electrical appliances, light bulbs, large waste, etc. ).
All waste ends up in the right place, and reusable items find a second home..
In total, the map of the project contains more than 100,000 such places.
"Over time, it will add collection yards, re-use centers, textile waste containers, food banks, charity shops, swap shops and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise become waste,, explains Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliðme Česko association.
I find it bad that in today's world, technology is so simple and resistant to stupidity that children who use a computer or a telephone to play games do not learn basic computer skills..
Recently, there has been a problem (especially in English articles) that students at universities do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple applications on photos or, more generally, mobile phones in general hide the underlying filesystem with its folders and everything is displayed on one screen in the application.
They can use the technique from childhood, but they must also learn something.
We will rewrite history, seriously
Before the weekend, Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU, which begins in January, and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for more than an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they could not be completed in half a year.
However, French politicians like it, and so do voters.
Macron's supporters are divided between the right and the left, but they agree on very little, except on Europe.
In France, there will be new presidential elections in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities..
The French leader, among other things, mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and that France is prepared to create conditions for such work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately jumped in with criticism, saying that Macron's speech was a piece of pro--European propaganda and that he was rewriting history.
In actual fact, this is an attempt to defend the rewriting of history.
The far--right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour is currently touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during the Second World War, was not so bad, and is having some success with this among the French.
Let's take Macron's idea of one history textbook seriously and not look at what is happening in France.
It would not have been necessary.
Students in European countries are often taught history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French and the Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
However, if they do not have an enlightened teacher, they will not know the wider context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida.
The Czech "Myši" did not win..
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for best director and best actress, Jasna Durić.
At this year's Karlovy Vary film festival, he was in the first ranks of the audience ratings..
The best actor award in Berlin went to Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy or fit and he is not vaccinated.
It was like having the flu or being in a bad mood. For a few days, he had diarrhea and didn't feel like smoking.
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
With the flu, I don't have diarrhea.
(Only personal experience. I do not claim that this is the case for everyone)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be published on 20 December, will contain a traditional literary supplement.
Along with it, cultural tips will be published.
The book is given to the subscribers as a bonus with this digital release, so that they have enough time to buy books as Christmas presents.
Prose texts that follow on from the previous collection of similar works by Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another dose of observation of the world and description of everyday things with unusual poetic awareness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second novel, photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.

The bohemist and comparatist transfers the fairy tale of the Red Riding Hood to the setting of a contemporary village.
Her presentation is more brutal than the popular versions and culminates in a horror film about emotional emptiness.

In his last novel, the author tells a less sentimental story about the return from emigration than he is used to telling.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a life together..
Trains begin to run according to the new timetable, in some cases the carriers change.
Since Sunday, trains have been running according to a new timetable..
The biggest change is the replacement of the carriers on some routes, such as between Ústím nad Labem and Kolín, where instead of ČSD, RegioJet began to operate.
For the most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, as well as their route,, if necessary.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks..
Transport companies started selling tickets during the autumn..
Czeck Railways plan to operate an average of 6,783 passenger trains per day, with an average of 478 long- distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
The new timetable will also see trains running to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Along with the new timetable, the company will introduce dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be the Interjet trains, which will run on the routes from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will operate in the north of Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier also traditionally increases fares from the next year by an average of 3.2 percent..
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the line R23 from Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace České dráhy here after the success in the ministry of transportation's competition.
Every day, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains on the route, eight in each direction.
Other changes affect long--distance services between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at stations in Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express kept its 16 routes, two return routes to Slovakia and also the weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the transport operator tried to maintain as similar timetables as possible for its long--distance trains despite the planned maintenance work.
Trains operated by Arriva and other operators should continue to operate without major changes..
The carriers also change in some regional lines.
Passengers will be affected, for example, on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk, where instead of Czech Railways trains, Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run.
Passengers will also be able to use a single fare on the railways for the second year in a row.
Similarly, the price of Czech Railways will increase by 3.2 percent due to inflation.
I don't agree.
The other side of the coin is not being taught.
Everywhere we hear how much they had to struggle for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard, they died.
In life, I have never heard a lecture from the point of view of the slaveholding side or from that time, and no one defends it or condemns it.
Nobody tells you in schools that blacks often sold themselves into slavery themselves and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one is taught at school that colonists often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they are told how brutally the Europeans exterminated them, yet they were killing each other long before the Europeans arrived.
For some time, he also spent time in the United States, directly at schools, in northern schools and in southern schools.
I have not encountered the deliberate concealment of facts, but he has heard that it happens and that it is a problem, which he does not deny (for example, in Japan, the atrocities of World War II are taboo).
His main point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in someone's feelings, it is just the way it was, and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn someone without looking at the circumstances of the time.
On the other hand, they should learn from it and never repeat it..
After all, when it comes to the Southern states, yes, the confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, but they also had some of their own successes, and it seemed absurd to reject them.
In addition, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it today.
A lot of people also forget that not all people in the South were slave owners, and that a lot of things went against them.
This is not comparable to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, they lie and manipulate, in addition, the viewpoint of the Czechs does not exist (there was a video on Youtube of a television broadcast where someone who started talking about the Czech legionaries and 1968 was cut off).
What surprised me about US schools was the rise of Marxism and idealization of communism, something they never experienced in their country.
In general, it seemed to me that at some universities, the students were quite radicalized, and the schools sometimes supported them in this..
And when I imagine that these people will be much older, it makes me a little uncomfortable with the idea that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young and in the governing elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has long since achieved what it wanted and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
At present, those who call themselves feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, which often leads to opposition even to quite reasonable things.
The more radical someone is,, the more they are heard..
On the other hand, at the end of the day, I have not met anyone who has condemned him for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, he encountered poor geography, but this was a two--way street. :D
Not because he likes it here, but because he thinks it is pointless.
He should be proud of something that he did not achieve on his own.
In addition, the concept of nationality as a whole is considered unnecessary from the point of view of some personal identity.
If there is something that connects me with people, it is interests, views on the world and shared experiences, and not where they were born.
I am not a believer, but from what he knows, he can say that there are two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but he always manages to say something stupid about the coronavirus, which everyone is embarrassed about.
There is also the Czechoslovak Church of the Brethren.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in reality they emerged from Catholic modernism and are in fact Catholic without a pope..
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but go to services to the Hussites because it is theologically very similar, but the members are generally more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on the Botanical Street..
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and every Sunday at 3 p.m. they hold masses in Latin, as they did before Vatican II.
The Thorn of Bethlehem is in Czechia, the scouts received it from Austria.
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The Scouts, however, did not go to Vienna for the second time because of the pandemic of the coronavirus. in the morning they received it from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing of Reintal – Břeclav.
Last year, they handed it over at the border.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which the squad participates in every year, and they look forward to it a lot.
It is an honour to be chosen, said scout Amalie Budzikova to the present journalists.
Whilst last year the handover took place at the border crossing of Mikulov- Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, this year it took place at the border crossing of Reintal – Břeclav on the parking lot.
Normally, however, they travel by train to Vienna.
There is no change in the delivery of firecrackers across the Czech Republic..
With the Bethlehem light, scouts traditionally travel by train first to Brno, where they hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle..
On Saturday 18 December, scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, travelling on selected express trains and passenger trains.
From them, the light will be taken over by local scouts or volunteers, who will then spread the flame throughout Czechia, even to places where tracks do not lead..
This year, scouts must comply with valid measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It is similar to last year.
They give recommendations to the courier teams as well as to the organizers of local events to wear masks, to keep a safe distance, not to sing their colleagues and to behave in a way that is as safe as possible, the spokeswoman for the light of the Bethlehem, Zuzana Hrbková described.
The tradition of the pilgrimage of the Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that overcomes darkness.
In Czechia, scouts and scoutettes have been spreading it for more than 30 years.
The actions are carried out by hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human togetherness..
All the announcements, including the list of places where people can come to get a candle, can be found on the website of Betlemskesvetlo.cz.
He does not have an economics education, so he does not know the fundamentals of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but he does not think that subsidies as a whole are a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education use the money appropriately,, but I don't understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and in general to companies.
As it is mentioned - it produces a surplus product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company.
I work in a factory where there are millions of posters saying "XY is financed or co--financed by project XY" and such a company is just artificially kept alive..
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the slowing down of the development when this company, as it is, holds and takes away contracts and employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Unanimous agreement, it's horrible.
Sometime even a person who was born in the age of the internet gets caught in some kind of trick or trap - especially advertisements..
He thinks that the internet advertisements do not affect him, but then he finds out that he has been influenced by them as well - it is just that it is so cleverly done that it is impossible to resist it.
For this reason, he supports radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to impose an absolute ban on programmatic advertising.
It's all nonsense, in the words of the classic - I would ban the internet.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe in something that the majority believes in and makes sense, I am not a sheep, but rather I will believe in something that is less likely to make sense, but it is important that he has his own original opinion about which he will insist that it is critical thinking. "
2. "I won't believe everything the media say. "
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television is following the trend of Christmas films, this year there are two hundred premieres.
Los Angeles – Kina, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries fell into the trend of Christmas films and this year presented their viewers with a record number of more than 200 premieres.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
In recent years, the genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been a hit with the audience and has significantly increased viewership. As a result, more and more of these films are being produced..
This year, four times as many Christmas films were filmed as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database, on the other hand, included only those films with the word Christmas (Vánoce) in their titles,, so the actual number of Christmas films is much higher.
Traditionally associated with Christmas, such films have existed since time immemorial.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated above all with fairy tales, worldwide, films such as Home Alone, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or the classic Christmas film Life is Beautiful from 1946 are popular.
However, the real boom of Christmas films did not start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark launched a special film series. The BBC News website reported.
Her advent project Countdown to Christmas ( Countdown to Christmas ) at the time included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began to prepare its viewers for Christmas as early as 22 October, presenting a total of 42 Christmas films.
The competing channel Lifetime has 35 new films with Christmas themes in its programme this year, and the popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the overall total.
In this magical time of the year, the story doesn't matter so much, what is important is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it is snowing. Brandon Gray, author of the book on Christmas movie called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies) described the genre in a tongue- in cheek manner.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to at least for two hours feel a little bit of calm in the midst of all this festive madness and the madness of the world in which we have been living for the last few years, he added.
According to him, Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
They have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there is a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which is, however, resolved successfully and the two of them kiss.
This is how it goes on and on, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people go to see them one after the other, Gray adds.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater is staggering.
It is somewhat like a portable jewelry store and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what he wanted to create, but little experience, at home, sweaters were never much worn,. Liban admits that he spent over 3000 hours working on his project.
The silk was bought in Italy, 24 carat gold threads were bought in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by the Swarovski company.
Silver stars were decorated with 150 diamonds.
The basic material is wool and cotton, but silk gives the scarf its softness, said the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing it.
And there is a further complication.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold so far, sold five years ago, cost "just" 720,000 Czech crowns.

The government approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
The soldiers, scouts and pilots of drones could leave before Christmas, the mission has been approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish colleagues with border protection with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence..
Poland officially asked for help from NATO countries in relation to several months of actions by the Belarussian regime, which invites citizens from the countries of the Near East with a false promise of easy crossing of the European Union borders.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory..
The Omikron mutation is spreading in the south of Moravia.
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
At the moment, another suspected case of this variant has been reported in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class..
Direct contact with the previous cases from the Adamov school is not proven," Ciupek said.
In the week, six cases were reported in the region.
The official confirmation of the variant in the six cases is still awaiting confirmation by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and non-influenza viruses at the State Institute of Hygiene in Prague, said the director.
She added that it was two nurses from one workplace of the Faculty Hospital in Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year old boys from ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, four without symptoms.
No one suspected of being infected with Omikron traveled abroad.
None of those mentioned traveled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor did they have any contact with anyone who had been abroad.
There is no connection with the swimming world championships, Ciupek said.
The main hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that the international water polo tournament in Brno, which took place a few weeks ago, is being investigated.
Among them were players from South Africa and one Belgian player after returning home became ill.
California restricts the sale of firearms.
He wants to follow the example of Texas in banning abortion.
Governor of California Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and manufacture of some weapons in the most populous state of the United States using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after detecting the heartbeat of the embryo.
People would then be entitled to compensation if they sue anyone in California who manufactures or sells assault weapons and homemade firearms.
Newsom's announcement responded to Friday's ruling by the US Supreme Court, which upheld the Texas ban on abortion, although it goes against a nearly 50- year old precedent that established the right to abortion throughout the United States up to the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court has not yet decided on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue that stems from the innovative construction of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban, however, was transferred to the public in this case, which meant that the Texas Republicans prevented it from being challenged in the usual judicial way.
He was outraged by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States to allow the Texas ban on most abortion services to remain in place, and to a large extent support the maneuver of Texas to protect its law. The governor of California said.
"Now that states can block federal courts from reviewing their laws, California is using this power to protect human life, " continued Newsom.
According to his subordinates, he tasked them to work together with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would empower the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
This term is used to refer to homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants citizens to have the right to demand compensation of at least 10,000 dollars (over 220,000 Kč) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, parts for " ghost guns " or kits to make them in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons out of our streets is through private lawsuits, that's exactly what should be done,, said the governor of California.
The Associated Press notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military- style weapons for decades, but a federal judge overturned the ban as unconstitutional in June.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas model, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion on Friday's majority ruling warned against the expansion of this legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant complete immunity from judicial review to the Texas ban on abortion and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against selected officials of the southern state of the United States.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, during which the procedure for administering the vaccine and the vaccine itself are gradually improved on the basis of the results..
From Israel alone, studies on the effects of four doses are already rolling in..
And according to these studies, the level of antibodies in most patients increases fivefold, which has the aforementioned long--term effect.
Just like any other vaccination, it will eventually have its own vaccination schedule, but it is still too early for that..
An additional fact is that a new vaccine, based on inactivated viruses,, which according to the specifications of the manufacturer promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness, is expected to come onto the market soon.

How to legally watch the Champions League online.
He does not know if there is any online service in the Czech Republic that would allow him to watch the Champions League for a fee.

I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change television and internet providers.
Poland threatened to stop paying into the EU budget.
According to Ziobra, the European Commission acted in violation of the law if it used its new powers and stopped paying money to Poland because of the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to use 3.6 billion euros from the EU reconstruction fund to revive the economies affected by the pandemic of COVID-19.
It is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use the mechanism to withdraw EU funding from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU by vetoing all decisions that require unanimity, said Ziobro, the leader of the small Solidarity Party, without whose vote the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
Poland should also consider its commitments in the European Union's energy and climate policies, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,, Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, he will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be unforgivable in light of the fact that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, which also contributes to it, added the Polish minister.
His party's approach to the EU is more radical than that of the governing party of Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that took place in Polish justice during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels is building "impossible conditions, because its goal is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland. "
Warsaw is facing "politically dictated blackmail through intimidation and attempts to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the most powerful and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels, which would result in limiting Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony,," he said.
It's hard to keep track of them. In Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
He did not look for other things, he met one yogurt more than once, he only needed cheese and parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves, he gave up and asked.
They did have it, it is true, in that narrow sector there were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and the lactose-free zone.
If they do not have it, I will not go to any market, even if there is an action or a gold shop on the square, they may not have such a wide selection, but they usually have everything that I need, and they have it in order,, so it only takes ten minutes to finish.

And to me, it's all the same..
For two years, I have been observing how data is handled here as if it were manure, and most opponents of vaccination are only slightly more out of the loop than most supporters of vaccination.
Rational discussion does take place on a professional level,, but only extreme views make it into the public sphere.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless..
Banning everything, allowing everything..
Coloured cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparison of apples and pears.
This state has it that way and we have it that way.
But that the methodology for collecting data is different in the two states is not discussed.
Oh my God, I'm so relieved..
I apologize for the outburst and wish them all a nice day.
As a child, I was punished with a spoon..
It was never because of the marks, usually it was just that she repeatedly refused to listen and behaved badly ( read instead of going to bed, fighting with her brothers, etc. ).
At the same time, she has never been punished without warning, her mother always first threatened that if she did it again, she would get a slap (at times even after another " catching her with a spoon and putting it down so that she could see it).
Only after repeatedly refusing to listen, she received a few blows to the buttocks (through clothing).
Personally, I believe that physical punishments ( in a reasonable manner and degree ) are beneficial, because the child reacts much more to them than to words.
According to me, the part with the warning is the most important, because it gives the child a choice whether to disobey and be punished, or to improve and avoid punishment.
In the end, he usually only needed to warn her to get her to start listening..
Defense of the system
When the significant Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 responded to a journalist's question about what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document on which oaths are sworn and which is taught in schools from an early age, or whether it is a treaty that can be changed if necessary - he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once, they agreed on democratic rules for their lives, which also define who they are as a state and its citizens, and with changes are better preserved.
Some nations, on the other hand, even like their own rules.
just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and sauerkraut, Vojtěch Cepl commented at the time.
However, in recent years, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be changed has become increasingly common among lawyers.
The years have been tested by situations that its creators (of which Vojtěch Cepl was one) could not have foreseen, such as the behaviour of the directly elected president..
In one thing, however, Cepl was right..
All that is known about such documents shows that political interventions into their texts must be carefully considered.
The institute must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to overcoming most of the crises that plague societies across history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a sort of rule of governance consisting of individual rules that set boundaries for politicians to play within.
They are afraid that too much power will be used against minorities or individuals, so politicians impose bans.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not discriminate, in the FN Brno, several months old babies are fighting for their lives.
Despite knowing that the coronavirus is usually milder on children, there are also severe cases, with which hospitals have been struggling in recent times.
Children are at a lower risk of being affected and injured than adults, with figures of 2 to 5 per cent compared to adults, according to Noves. The head of the Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University, Petr Dominik.
The course of the disease is usually much easier, lighter and often without symptoms.
There are, however, children who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which can be seen especially in the last period,, said Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place in the children's infectious diseases clinic.
The very seriously ill children with the coronavirus are in the last few weeks in the intensive care unit..
Children with post--COVID syndromes were on the ward continuously throughout the year according to the doctor.
There is an increase in the number of children with acute cases of pneumonia caused by the coronavirus, which means with pneumonia requiring resuscitation, he said, adding that this disease affects both adults and adolescents as well as several- months old babies.
In the hospitals there are also children in a serious condition due to the coronavirus.
"At the moment, there is a child of several months and adolescent age lying in the hospital,, " said the chief physician.
However, he is happy that in the children's hospital of the FN Brno, they have not recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominika, the presence of a psychologist in a children's hospital is an integral part of the cooperation between the psychologist and the hospital.
At the same time, he also points out the fact that, just as with adults, vaccination mitigates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post--covid syndrome.
" Therefore, the application of vaccine doses is also recommended for children, " the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, one can only walk on marked paths.
However, the quiet zones are not very large.

In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone, one can walk anywhere (but not over the fence into the enclosures).
Driving or skiing in the forest outside of marked trails is prohibited everywhere, except in national parks.

China is creating the impression that it is handling the outbreak well and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
Sinologist Jirouš said that China is building the impression that it is handling the epidemic well and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
China launched medical and political offensives.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for not being able to stop the spread of the infection, which turned into a global pandemic.
Now, the countries are reporting zero new cases of infection.
Countries, including Czechia, are competing for Chinese protective gear, and Chinese doctors are assisting in the fight against the coronavirus, including in the worst- affected Italy.
How to perceive the willingness of Beijing.
It is friendly support or the communist regime is trying to improve its image in the world.
He meets a friend of a friend and says to him: hey, he doesn't want a sloth.
I have one and it's fantastic.
The wife is happy because he mows the grass, washes the car with his mouth, the children play with him.
It's just fantastic.
If he wants for 5,000 slonis, he can buy it.
Friend: I'll just say that it's going to be great.
After a while, they meet and the one who bought it complains: what a fool I was to buy it for a lion.
The lawn is trampled, everywhere there are huge piles of dung, the car is broken, the children are afraid of it and the wife wants to get a divorce.
The man who sold the slonik says that the slonik spoke badly of the slonik, so he didn't sell the slonik.
The world is controlled by great powers.
Although there is equality between sovereign states, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, it has functioned on the economic and political (in selected issues) levels, but there is still no military integration.
Personally, I believe that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It will not be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But by the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will succeed.
I had the same idea and it is quite possible..
I'm not an expert in Czech, so perhaps a word- nerd.
This is based on the fact that the ellipse usually encompasses two different units on the same level.
He uses an example from another comment " Spanish oranges and mandarins, where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas with " Spanish oranges and mandarins " it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
In addition, it is based on the fact that the sentence sounds like "all American forces" including their weapons and that he knows that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad concept and that it is not necessary to specify it further for the American forces..
And again,, just as an example,:D
Whatever the case,, it is a nonsensical demand.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured monkey kangaroo Milly.
Dreadful footage shows the moment a terrified monkey crouched in a toilet bowl, before its callous owner flushed it and mocked it.
Holland also fed the apes with sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of their actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrates Court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, reported The Sun newspaper.
The experts in the rehabilitation of primates, who care for Milly after her abuse, said that they had never seen a monkey so terrified.
Milla spent nearly two years in rehabilitation at Monkey World in Dorset and now happily plays with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The four--time mother admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the magistrates' court in Gwent, she was sentenced to 120 days in prison, with a suspended sentence of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, a lifetime ban on keeping animals, and was ordered to pay 12,000 euros in court costs.
Leader of the Small Monkeys team, which rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer said "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue. "
It took Milly a long time to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
Opička refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she has settled down and is happy with her mate, she can still be frightened by the sight of new people.
The psychological scars from the abuse will haunt her for the rest of her life, Sawyer says.
The abuse of Milly was revealed after police in Gwent found disturbing footage on her phone after a raid on her home following allegations of drug use.
In the footage, Milly can be heard vulgarly swearing.
The next video shows Holland's monkey offering cocaine and saying "I want cocaine. "
I'll lick his fingers.
In May, together with his partner Russell Cox (43), he admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her home, 1600 pounds of cocaine (approx. 50,000 Czech crowns) were found hidden in Kinder egg cartons.
Cox was sentenced to 30 months in prison and Holland received a 20- month suspended sentence.
And what amazing concepts he teaches from that prehistoric period three times in a row, when he bravely jumps over the whole 20th century.
As if he took the same things in the first year as in the sixth grade.
The whole thing kills the idea of biflovation, where no one cares whether they can do it or understand it.
In particular, to write a test for 1 and then no one is interested in anything else.
He went to the street and asked random people if they could solve a quadratic equation with certain roots and coefficients.
Everyone has gone through this, and the vast majority of them don't even blink and say that they have it in their pants..
So, what the fuck they are learning for..
I am a big fan of general overviews and the fact is that people do not want and do not need them..
And at that moment it is pointless and it never gets to them anyway..
Partially, it is for the large number of people who need a particular thing.
And as for the note that standing next to the machine, all of this is not needed at all, I meant it absolutely seriously. ... because it is not needed at all..
In addition, they are slowly approaching the time when not knowing is a sign of punk..
(which is probably due to the country's communist past and the stigmatization of intellectuals and elites) However, the price of the fact that these machines will stand there with barbarians is high.
If journalists were able to count, they would probably never have reached these proportions in the case of covid..
Marriage at First Sight: Kadri's and Andrey's war continues.
This is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately, " replied Andrea on Instagram in Stories to inquisitive fans who asked her why she was so disappointed with Kadri that she decided to cut off all contact and even block him on social media.
Between Kadrim and Andreou, the sparks flew from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri was living and working in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move there with him, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
However, she resolutely rejected this.
And as it turned out, their relationship did not end in love, but rather degenerated into mutual disrespect and even hatred..
It was a planned attack from him, said Kadri in response to Andreino's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's ex- wife's alleged sincerity did not go down well with his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, we don't talk about such things at all, and in the family, they were never talked about much.
I don't want to provoke any kind of pity.
But when I see someone who tries to publicly humiliate and tarnish the reputation of someone whom she loves so much, it just doesn't sit well with her.
I'm sorry that I have to do it this way, but I wanted to publicly thank her brother Kadrim for the fact that he made himself into a character and helped his family when they needed him the most, even though he was in such a young age.
It's more painful for me to have to read such inaccurate information, which is probably taken out of context.
I would have liked everyone to know Kadri as well as I, his relatives and family did, as stated in the confession in response to the words of Andrey.
I am really grateful to him for everything.
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that he, his family, love him above all else and know the truth and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed up the façade to the fifth floor.
I can't believe it for what reason.
Cchao began his robbery raid at a parking lot in a residential district, where he attempted to break into several cars.
According to available information, he stole less than 330 Czech crowns from one vehicle.
He then climbed up to the fifth floor and jumped out of an open window into the apartment.
He stole two bananas.
The footage from one of the security cameras shows him leaving the scene and eating a banana at the same time.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
Cchaa was then detained.
The man admitted that he drank alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money,, in a drunken state, he decided to rob.
The matter is currently under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the façade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time--limited and tied to pandemic readiness.
When this is repealed, the law is no longer effective.
However, the law limits the scope of business.
It does not suffice as a reason.
The right to gather will be limited, but not abolished.

They will then be published in the Sbírka zákonů.
I think that the bigger problem would have been.
A dead civilian or a foreign politician.
I think that all of the things that these people here are writing are well known to him..
He plays the fool just to have someone to argue with..
If not, it is sad.
I don't say that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
And even from an aesthetic point of view, I like a lot of church buildings. (which was, in fact, the aim, for them to look good).
It doesn't matter to me who believes in what.
On the other hand, he dislikes how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it accumulated, the suppression of science and so on.
Not to mention all the wars caused by it,, e.g. the Thirty Years' War.
In short, one can believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do with each other.
The man fell from a height of twelve metres.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An unbelievable fall survived by a man on Sunday night in Ostrava, who was rescued by the emergency services of the regional Zdravotnické záchranne služes.
The staff of the regional operational center received the emergency call one hour after midnight on Saturday with the initial information about the fall of the man from a height.
Immediately, two rescue teams from the ZZS – medical and paramedic – were sent to the scene..
After arriving at the scene, the medics discovered that the twenty-seven- year old man had fallen from the window from a height of around twelve metres and hit his head on the concrete.
In Vítkovice, coal caught fire.
But not in the way it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was in a coma, with multiple injuries and in imminent danger of death.
The attending doctor inserted an endotracheal tube into his respiratory tract, ensured artificial pneumatic ventilation, and after further measures in pre-hospital emergency care, he was transported by ambulance to the trauma center of the Ostravian trauma center, informed the spokesman for the ZZS MS region, Lukas Humpl.
Bigger fears than of the coronavirus are of inappropriate reactions from the public and the authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in Czech means a challenge for politicians and civil servants, but the first line of defense against the infection is the doctors and medical personnel.
How serious the situation is from their point of view.
The interview is with military doctor David Řezáč.
Director: Matěj Válek, researcher Tomáš Roček, sound master David Kaiser, music Martin Hůla.
Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt.
MMA had a spectacular night with many interesting results.
At the UFC 269 tournament, things happened.
Outsiderka Julianna Peňová managed to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had been unbeaten for seven years.
Charles Oliveira in the lightweight division didn't hesitate, showed great chokeholds against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara- France also won, quickly knocking out Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
He also defeated Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
It featured a women's bantamweight bout between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peňová.
The American entered the battle as a virtual " dwarf " since Nunes had not lost a match for seven years and was hungry for another victory.
The beginning of the duel was in line with the paper predictions.
Nunes started the fight very aggressively and the opponent even received a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be coerced into making any more mistakes and herself attempted to attack with a punch on the arm, unsuccessfully.
The second round was thrilling and for MMA fans, very tense.
Both opponents delivered a number of brilliant strikes and hard hooks.
Pena also knocked Nunes to the ground, where she began stomping on her.
She had to abandon her efforts and shake off the attack.
The American thus prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the evening was the fight for the lightweight title between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier.
At first, Poirier had the better of his opponent,, but the tide began to turn.
In the second round, Oliveira tried to be more aggressive against his opponent, attempting to take him down with an armlock.
However, he did not do this very well, and then he created a lot of pressure, got the opponent on his back and showered him with a series of blows.
Thanks to this, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, after which he had to submit to the choke.
Bracilians defended the title, Poirier, on the other hand, lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley had a suvereign victory, who already in the first round knocked out Rauliana Paivu with a hard right to the back.
He then knocked him out with a series of precisely aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth victory..
Kara- France then defeated Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another victory with her little daughter, now seven years later, she lost..
The knee, or the knee.
At first glance, this is not a difficult task.
The vast majority of nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender,, so it is easy to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neutral.
However, there is also a relatively large group of substantives for which the gender is not fixed..
Such nouns oscillate between two genders.
In conjugation, they acquire double consonants and in some cases remain in the unconjugated form.
For example, the words "swivel" and " hip " are both masculine and feminine, in the first case they are declined according to the model " machine " and in the second according to the model " song ".
In the case of another group of substantives, the different forms are already present in the first declension of the singular,, e.g. " row / row " or " kedluben / kedlubna " or " potato / potato " (in the sense of food).
Both forms are grammatically correct and have the same meaning, so they are freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as "cucumber " in Bohemia and "cucumber " in Moravia, in this case, the Moravian variant is non- standard. Similarly, other Bohemian- Moravian pairings of words include " ditch " and " ditches ", " cake " and " cakes " and so on.
Some words, which entered the Czech language from other languages, were originally non- declinable, but eventually acquired Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image ", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word " buffet ", which has remained in the middle gender, is not declined according to the " castle " model.
Turkey opened the way for migrants to enter Europe.
What the situation looks like directly on the Greek border.
Tensions are rising on the Greek- Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants who are trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to leave for the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped protecting them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, humanitarian aid is also being prepared by the Czech government..
What actually motivates refugees to embark on the uncertain journey.
And how the situation looks directly on the spot.
For three months, they did not see the blue sky and suffocated, described the journalist from Sydney.
The devastating fires, which have plagued Australia for four months, have killed nearly three hundred people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
and how the local authorities and the inhabitants themselves are coping with the disaster.
The government of Prime Minister Morrison could have done more to prevent the drastic impact, as claimed by critics.
and what the land will have to prepare for in terms of climate change in the future.
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Sydney--based journalist Ikou Detrich.
Fake accusations have always been and are still very rare.
Therefore, it is written about each person everywhere.
For people, it is uncomfortable to deal with the issue of how sexual violence manifests itself in our society and how widespread it is, and they try to sweep it under the carpet.
He does not know personally anyone who was falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped, and he has witnessed the way their communities or the police often treat them..
The victims should always be believed..
The trend is for the victims to finally open up about their traumas.
However, it is still the case that too many people keep it for themselves.
And there are those who falsely accuse someone..
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual assault, but spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are fabricated" and that it is a " trend " helps only sexual assault perpetrators.
Czechs are flooded with unfinished houses, families do not have money to complete them.
The prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in the last few weeks and months.
A number of people have found themselves in difficult situations as a result..
It does not have the means to complete the unfinished family houses and banks refuse to increase the hypothecary loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
As a result, people do not have enough money to complete the unfinished family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase hypothecary loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move into unfinished and unlicensed houses.
In the worst case, the unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them, because they cannot afford to pay off the mortgages and rent at the same time. says economist BHS Štěpán Křeček.
They build two to three family houses a year and in 50 percent of the cases, they succeed.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult because they have to comply with certain things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
There is no profit to be made, said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of the construction company.
A lot of people will only have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house would cost five million, now it will cost seven.
I think some will be waiting," Slivoň added.
The most expensive materials were copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment.
However, construction companies also struggle with a shortage of workers.
In Czech there is a shortage of graduates of civil engineering and the influx of foreign workers is slowed down by the pandemic.
Only the situation regarding the issuing of building permits is more favourable at this time..
In October, 7,675 building permits were issued, nearly 10 percent more than the previous year, said Křeček.
We are doing well and will be doing even better.
Real visions are lacking, the commentator of ČRO - myRozhlas said.
The beginning of the new year was accompanied by traditional celebrations, as well as speeches by politicians.
In addition to Prime Minister and ANO leader Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, this year the nation was addressed by the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
The most important thing they learned was:
In this way, the master's thesis is perfect for me, he chooses his own topic, builds on the bachelor's thesis, works on it for a whole year and then writes the written part in a week or two.
State exams are completely peaceful in this country, as long as the person is not a total monkey and has something left in his head, the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate him with theory.
I, for example, studied for the state exams for a week, and when he was in a bind, the exam committee always tried to lead him to some logical derivation,, which he immediately understood, and he had it right.
As for those projects,, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project (they did it a lot, it was really beneficial, they learned a lot) and then they only have to learn the project and they are done..
According to me, it is super if at the end of a subject there is a test, in which the knowledge gained during the course of the project is incorporated, not just the defense.
All is well, but don't overwhelm emails and phone calls and don't send any packages to the embassy..
He's going to be the same asshole as them.
Them people at the embassy have nothing to do with that..
And if they were against Russia, they would have risked a lot, so they might have to play against them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
And he can just as easily put a statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh..
E.g. so that it reaches Xi Jinping's backside or something like that.
I agree, despite the fact that Insta is throwing artists under the bus.
As soon as every day he does not send stories and at least every second day he does not send a new picture, his reach decreases to the absolute minimum..
In addition, it keeps changing what is more important, whether it is a like, a comment or a save..
It really annoys me nowadays, so maybe he will have to reduce to TikTok, where many artists from his industry are successful and don't care much about it..
In the end, I would even be happy if something more user-friendly came along, one that does not suck out all the creativity and energy from artists.
The Party of the Working People of Donbas Statement
Union – yes, disintegration – no, express their opinion against the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
Thirty years after the illegal breakup of the Soviet Union.
On 8 December 1991, the biggest geopolitical catastrophe in human history occurred.
On 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevič, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with an open and tolerant attitude towards Mikhail S. Gorbačov, secretly and without regard to the people signed an agreement that "the Soviet Union as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceased to exist.
One stroke of the pen " abolished " a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Even without the loss of the non---Russian population of the former Soviet republics, more people have been lost than in both World War I and World War II combined.
The same people who destroyed what had been built over the previous 70 years in the Belarussian primeval forest, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, detached from the greatest world power fourteen republics that were previously economically linked in a single mechanism.
If one wants to look even deeper, one sees the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of economies, science and armies, the growth of criminality, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post--Soviets space, a series of orange revolutions, NATO's expansion to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the abandonment of the socialist camp and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "vacuum of power ".
Everything that was betrayed and abandoned in haste quickly filled and conquered the lands of NATO, which accepted the geopolitical capitulation of the Russians.
The whole world is still reeling from the events of the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover does not necessarily correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and in the supermarket they have some meat that costs 189 Kč / kg.
I he will buy it with the condition that he will put it in the fridge and make it for dinner on Thursday.
In the alternative reality in which he does not buy meat on Mondays, the chain lowers its price to 99 Kč / kg on Tuesday - he describes the mechanism by which the meat's price becomes a burden on his digestive system.
Or he could wait until Thursday, when the meat would be priced at 69 Kč / kg, 1 day before the date of expiration,, which would make this meat different from the one he bought on Monday for 120 Kč more and kept in his fridge for 3 days.
I respond to himself - nothing..
These jokes about the fact that when something is cheap, it must be bad, rotten or of poor quality are extremely retarded, to put it mildly ;-)
Recently, he went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass, young women were distributing some kind of brochure, he always picks up things like this to help out brigadiers, they can't throw them away.
The brochure was full of rural common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but there was nothing about God, he was confused, but he suspected that it was some kind of propaganda.
After reading it, he found out who published it and in the end it turned out to be Scientology.
No, as it was a good matrosh, full of utterly pointless lessons, that one should wash oneself and not be a pičus.
It is a pity that paper is wasted because of this,, as a result of which it would not be necessary to cut down the forests.
Something similar happened with his ex- girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail force that person to comply, even though he or she doesn't realize how bad the situation is.
She has threatened to hurt him because of the fact that he went out with a friend whom she did not like.
Or when he wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she burst into tears and on her knees begged him not to leave.
Then he started physically blocking the doors.
For about a year, it was a great relationship, but then another half year passed and she started to get bored.
After that, he ended the relationship by saying that he was breaking up with her, but he lied to her by saying that they could still talk about it next week to calm her down.
Such a person sucks out feelings, emotions and overall joy..
It is better to keep one's distance.
When the insurance companies are rapaciously buying up test kits and rushing to find positives, those who would not have known about the terrible disease had they not been tested.
The only thing they achieve is to complicate things for companies, transport companies and others, because their employees in the generator of random numbers have been sentenced to five days of house arrest.
In the west, they have already given up with this nonsense and have come to the conclusion that it is not worth dealing with a disease that is not as famous as the chickenpox.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to steal some more and inflate his ego by inventing new regulations.
It looks like the old shady character is coming back again.
After several years of stagnation and repression of this nefarious business, MLM recruitment is again on the rise.
He was one of the recruits, he tried it (he was 20 years old and a first--year student at university) and the initial promises of training in products and business skills quickly turned into "I don't care about this, the main thing is to recruit people. "
Honestly, he was interested in the products he offered, because he wanted to help people, but the training was more about scaring people and coercing them.
When the first money was earned, the person quickly realized that if he wanted to make money, he would have to produce a number of certain products every month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable things,, so then the person felt like a street hawker selling cauldrons.
But what I can say is that the experience was valuable, that one learns that one should not jump at every rumour and that one should verify information thoroughly..
At the same time, he did not want to throw all of them into one bag..
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial, but they are not going to brag about expensive consumer goods or "fattening" bank accounts.
In the corporation where he works, he has not experienced so many of these things.
HR is in a state of calm, managers are managing their managing and are not sticking their noses into anything..
Regular evaluations do take place, in the form of how they are carried out in the Czech Republic, which goes quite well ( he sets some goals for the next year, at the end of the year he looks at what has come out and what hasn't ) - it is more of a self--assessment rather than being judged by someone based on some numbers, and so on.
Company events are also not mandatory.
And within their own company, they are somewhat unique - there are departments that are more " corporate " in nature.
Sometime, a person has the feeling that we are almost a startup that squats in the offices of a large corporation.
However, it works in such a way that it doesn't bother them too much until the results come out..
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London..
Nine days, the British police searched in vain for the missing 32- year old Czech, who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, the outgoing Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
The British police confirmed today in the afternoon that they found the body of the missing Czech citizen in the Czech embassy in London.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, they will not disclose more information about the case.
Kulhane expressed his sincere condolences on Twitter.
The last time the young woman was seen was on 28 November in a bus on the way home from work, before boarding the bus she had withdrawn money from a bank machine.
Her disappearance was reported by her colleagues five days later.
After her, the London police began to investigate, and Interpol placed her on the list of missing persons worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech missing persons database.
Police have already detained one man in connection with the incident.
What role he played in the case and what he is suspected of, but did not reveal.

The processing of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a relatively demanding, but successful year.
Four new or repeated elections for municipal councils took place in it, as well as the very closely watched elections for the Chamber of Deputies.
They had to work in more difficult epidemiological conditions, which meant that they had to be better equipped and better staffed, Eva Krumpová, 1st Deputy Chairman of the Czech Statistical Office said.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will examine the results of the vote and, after approval, they will be published in the Official Gazette.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic..
It took a while to get used to the fact that there is a dangerous infectious disease in the area,, but it went smoothly without major setbacks.
Dealing with the fact that a large part of the population, on all its layers, is treating this in an idiotic way is still a problem for him..
He is most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow) because thanks to it, he will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not hovads..
He would have been stripped of his presidency and his ability to regain it.
However, the chances of this actually happening are very small, as others have mentioned.
In addition, he is not sure whether it would be possible to consider the destruction of the files as high treason.
Velezrada is an act that endangers the sovereignty, the territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
The impact of the pandemic on the intimate life: The number of people under 35 who have not had sex for an entire year is growing.
More and more young adults in the United States are living their lives without sex.
This is mainly a religiously based group,, according to the Daily Mail's website.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who abstain from sexual activity increased from eight to 21 percent.
The number of women between the ages of 18 and 35 who stated that they did not have sexual intercourse in the last year is more than ever before.
Other factors contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals include the results of a survey conducted by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher percentage of unemployment.
The presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex for young people less and less of a priority, may also have contributed.
Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they had no sex in the previous year has grown rapidly, according to researcher Lyman Stone of the IFS.
In married couples, sexual activity is more common, in 2021, only 5 % of them said that they had not had sex in the last year.
Among the free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also contributed to by fear of premarital sex and religious upbringing.
Despite the fact that married men are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and widowed young women under the age of 35 is still decreasing.
Young people are divided in their views on premarital sex, with about 30% seeing it as a bad thing and about 70 % seeing it as acceptable.
"It is true that only a minority of single individuals in this age group are free,, but their behavior is pushing this trend forward,, " said Stone about these thirty percent.
For the majority of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, among the free people younger than 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the proportion of abstinence increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among " less believers " the trend rose from 10 to 20 percent, Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, including less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of having sex is lower among people who are unemployed or have lower incomes.
An additional reason may be the expansion of digital media, which may reduce the need for sex.
As people spend more time online, this need is " replaced " by it.
This trend became popular especially during the lockdown during the pandemic of the coronavirus..
The whole process of vaccination against the flu is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave in a way they do not want to, but which may save their lives.
This is a relatively difficult question, one that is of particular interest to me, in terms of the social conscience..
e.g. the question of whether, if they do not enforce it and they die, it will be their fault.
His argument is that in the case of an 80--year old man who didn't really know what was going on, who heard some kind of misinformation and as a result didn't want to be vaccinated and eventually died of it.
On the other hand, I don't think that the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccinations, who, together with the SPD and the KSČ, was shouting about persecution and a totalitarian state, can be blamed.
From the statistics mentioned, it is possible to conclude that the vast majority of non- vaccinated pensioners belong to the second group, which means that they will be able to take care of themselves.
Czechia without snow.
How the mild winter affects the fight against drought.
This winter so far has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent years in Czechia.
The operators of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates, for example, the preparation of the Jizerské 50 bicycle race.
This is a trend, or an exception.
The fact that there will be little snow means that the fight against drought in Czechia will be affected.
I have one story to tell, but it is not about a punch--up..
Once, on a trip to the middle school, the teacher took them on a tour of the entire city to the shipyard, so that they could go on boats on the river.
Whilst on the way there, they went through one such quite wide street, and in the middle of it they saw a group of followers of the Hare Krišna sect.
Naturally, they piled on the pressure.
Fortunately, I managed to escape, but with one of her friends, they started talking..
When she left them, they asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
They asked me if he wanted to save his soul.
I told them that I don't have a soul, " she replied.
All of them, including the teachers, were laughing all the way to the docks.
We are terribly spoiled.
There is not much happening, but the system is collapsing, according to Orozovic.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in the relations between the two countries," said Morawiecki at the joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The crisis, caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, is, according to the chancellor, to be solved through diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the " Normandy Group " consisting of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that the Chancellor informed him about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially created a migrant crisis and uses people as living targets and weapons, as every night there are hundreds of attempts to cross the border illegally.
The Chancellor discussed further sanctions with him to ensure that Lukašenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understood that they are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz assured DPA that Warsaw enjoys German support in its dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by Lukašenko's regime.
The drunken Polish nun caused the accident and tried to conceal it.
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but it was driven by another nun, who tried to take the blame on herself.
When the policemen told her that she could also lose her driving license for not giving way and leaving the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, said the TVN24 station.
She admitted that she collided with another nun who asked her for help.
Policemen then came for Celestine's sister..
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and, after discovering that her blood alcohol content was over two percent, they immediately took her driver's license away from her.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess her crimes in court.
Pes Hugo does what he can.
However, Juraj Šajmovič did not protect his film..
Czech creators of family comedies were inspired by American stories about dog lovers.
However, they forgot to take into account a fundamental aspect of filmmaking: the laws of filmmaking..
After the kitschy film by F. Brabce Gump - a dog who taught people to live, another film is competing for the audience's emotions in the cinemas: Tady hlídáme my.
Co--author of the script and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr. freely follows up on his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
The talking fox Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the stage..
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a pension in the Šumava region that is on the verge of closure, start to invite dog owners to their pension, Julie's father with his partner and above all her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a young woman who is experiencing her first love..
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičova (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with the narrative in the previous dog film, but at least entertained children and the dog..
This time, the creative duo wrote a much weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's summarize.
Despite being a scientist, Julie is swayed by the child-bearing superstitions of the forest, and when the right " constellation " arises, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates dictate - on the hood of a car or a church tower ( of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide ) the retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, is shot dead in the forest by his own daughter ( Julie ) who falls into a coma, after which the family is removed from the hospital to allow the miraculous healing process to take place in the heart of the Šumava forest.
There is nothing wrong with a cleansing cure of nature and the power of the beloved animals.
Their owners know why they have them.
However, the viewer is amazed by the fact that such a large number of unbelievable situations and characters were needed to convey this message..
A couple of thieves from the staff, the competition of dog owners, the sharlatan from the Šumava, the policemen arriving on the basis of a complaint to look for "drugs" and discussing the strength of bone meal as a fertilizer - and which peeled- off family in a pension.
When the heroine wakes up from a long coma, she sits at a table with a cigar in her mouth and demands her father's whiskey and flank steak as a recovered vegetarian. It is impossible not to laugh.
At the end of the film, the creators explain to the audience that "this sometimes happens after a coma. "
Šajmović's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of how to work with a text, the ability to build a dramatic situation, a sense of character and a sense of point and direction.
The acting is uneven, the editing is sloppy, and the overall impression is muddled.
Whatever Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to keep their parties going, they have little to play..
The only claim of the film is the poetic shots of the Šumavian landscape by cameraman Vladimír Holomka and the pair of foxhounds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot and doggerel dialogue, of which the characters indulge.
Neither is the fact that she has been a member of the Club of Foxhound breeders for a long time, as in the case of the producer..
For good intentions to promote nature and friendship between man and dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft, if the person wants to tell a believable story.
This did not work in this case.
There is a little too much erotics and a little too little sensitivity for a good family film.
Even as an advertisement for canine therapy, this amateurish piece of work would not have passed..
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from people like him.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, which can be seen in the fact that he understands this shit, but only because he has never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want it, the answer will always be no.
If he had listened to the kids all the time, he might have changed his mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a temporary job to supplement income..
The Middle East is experiencing unusually dry months.
The only time of the year when it rains is winter.
"Almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as observed at some stations, is unusual, as confirmed by the Israeli Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long--term rainfall average for November.
The two days of rain in this week were rather exceptional.
It's good for us.
It had not rained for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop for the residents of Nazareth Wasím Aškar..
Rains in Israel occur almost exclusively in the winter months, they are intermittent and irregular.
Wetlands are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just forests, but also for drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Galilee Sea, filled to the brim this spring, thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has fallen.
Hydraulic engineers have been warning of drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there will be a decrease in rainfall in this area, " said Israeli Water Authority spokesman Uri Schor in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination and recycling of waste water.
The economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman,, the number of cistern vehicles is increasing.
Waters and private wells are drying up.
In September, cistern truck driver Imad Sulejman reported that his orders had increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years.
Fights broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The bed of the local river was completely dry.
The region has experienced the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran.
The Israeli Minister of Defense said that the talks in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington of plans to attack Iran's nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, Minister Benny Gantz announced that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is in the United States, is trying to persuade Americans to increase their pressure on Iran, but also to inform Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and that world powers " understand that the Iranians are playing with them. "
About three years ago, this also happened to me..
He liked her a little and grilled her during the conversation to find out what he wanted from her.
In the end, he discovered that his suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because he really doesn't like these underlings, he chided the young woman for a while with doubts and questions, and finally thanked her and left.
They can call me a crook, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
In the weekend, skiers went to the mountains, they were greeted with enough snow and good weather.
The ski resorts in Czechia experienced their first major influx of skiing enthusiasts this weekend..
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow, and some ski resorts started operating as a result..
Sjezdaře were not discouraged by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate at the lifts.
Whilst ski lift operators do not complain about the lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental services report a lower demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people took to ski trails and ski slopes in the Liberec region over the weekend..
The weather was favourable for skiers, which today offered sunshine and excellent snow conditions..
They are satisfied, the opening weekend went well from the very first evening of skiing on Friday, when the first skiers arrived on the mountain,, said the director of the Ještěd Sports Area, Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people headed for the first weekend of skiing in the new season also to Jeseník..
Ski Aréna Karlov and the Branna ski centre in Šumperk were open..
The weekend attendance was very good, on Saturday and today, approximately 400 people attended.
The conditions are excellent.
Today, the sun shone, the temperature was around minus three degrees, so it was perfect, said the representative of the ski resort in Branná, Rostislav Procházka.
The operators of ski resorts can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or who are in a period of recovery from the disease of covid-19.
In general, people are prepared for this and have the necessary documents, said ČTK's René Hroneš from the Skicenter Špindlerův Mlýn.
"There were only a few incidents, " he added.
Lower demand than before the pandemic is reported by some ski rental shops and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, there is interest in borrowing skis..
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
During the period of skiing courses, a greater pressure is expected.
David Šintak, chairman of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear also feels that there is not as much interest in renting skiing equipment as there used to be because of the pandemic.
At that time, before the pandemic, they were almost fully booked.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, they are at about 50 percent, said Šinták to ČTK.
According to him, people became lazy during the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, there is a great demand for the rental service in the Novako area in Bozhi Daru..
They started renting skis there a week ago, and those who want to rent them now have to order them in advance.
The skis will be available for rent from this weekend, but people had already called ahead, so the demand is expected to be high, just like last year, said Pavlína Nováková, the manager of the area.
The interest is comparable to the period before the epidemic, she says, also about the ski school.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay in the country, they must be able to live a quality life as in foreign countries.
This does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
The most intelligent and skilled people leave for foreign countries, where they have no property.
The owner of the company is not going to leave the country just like that..
And with the rest, he is completely in agreement..
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if they do not see a reasonable future for themselves in the Czech Republic, they will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary started when one beautiful day Orbán won, he ruled for a year and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic could not find itself in a similar position from one day to the next.
The next issue is the elections.
If life is bad here, a traditional V4 crazy could also win..
The young and the educated leave, staying are his supporters and people whose property cannot be stuffed into a plane..
A terrifying photo.
Langmajer was bleeding because of a bet over a beer.
Whilst in the Czech Republic, autumn was in full swing, in Thailand, the crew of the film Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather.
The actor then posted photos of himself with blood on his face on social media.
It's a real injury, or it's makeup for the sake of filming.
The London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
The last time she was seen was on the way home.
The disappearance of Petra bears no resemblance to her usual behaviour and the police in the Lambeth district, where she worked, are now very concerned,, said Lucy O'Connor from the police station in the Lambeth district, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her, and they simply want to know where she is. she continued.
The missing Czech, according to her, left work on Sunday 28 November at around 7.45pm and headed home to the area of Camberwell.
The last time it was reportedly seen was in an autobus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on 3 December.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy 's and St Thomas ' Hospital group.
The group of medical facilities said in a tweet that they were worried about their colleague Petra, who was missing.
"They wanted to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her find her way home to contact the police. "
The public has also been urged to cooperate by MP Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the case during a press conference on Saturday.
She has been missing for several days now, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably distraught.
"All of us have a special responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our health care,," Harman said.
The police had previously detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC's news website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what he is accused of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either..
This is not "an enormous number" but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
It should be noted that Ukraine constantly repeats that the threat of invasion is exaggerated and that it begins to resent its entry.
I cited above.
I don't know how he came to the conclusion that Russia wants to start a war..
War is sakra expensive and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 1938 is so one--sided that it is hard to know where to start.
I can compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that, after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex the ridiculous republics.
That's it and that's what the "concentration" at the border corresponds to.
And anyway, pacta sunt servanda.
From Sunday, new timetables are in force in Prague, mainly affecting suburban services.
Travellers in the integrated transport system of Prague (PID) will face several changes from Sunday, affecting mainly suburban services.
New lines were established, some changed their routes, and others were discontinued.
Mladoboleslavsko has been added to the integrated system..
Since Sunday, fast trains from České Budějovice have stopped at the Zahradní Městro station in the capital..
Trains S7, which travel from Beroun to Český Brodu, pass through the Central Station in Prague.
In the recently opened station of Prague-Zahradní Město, the rychlík R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov will now stop.
PID is now expanding to other areas.
In addition, buses will go as far as Světlé nad Sázavou, Blatna near Jesenice, Staré Splavs and Turnov.
The buses in the Mladoboleslav region, including those with overlaps to the Liberec and Královéhradeck regions, will be included.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced and 12 existing ones will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Zličin in Prague and go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection was also established between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovnik, which replaced the cancelled railway line S53.
In the morning rush hour and on weekends, services from Prague to Rakovnik will be strengthened, with the introduction of an express line number 404.
The PID system now includes lines 400 and 410, which travel to the Liberec region.
They depart from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
Line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubrovnik and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected services continue to Rumburak or Cvikov.
The supplementary line 410 runs from Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoné and Jablonné in Podještěd.
On the other hand, operation has been cancelled or reduced on 10 local railways in central Bohemia, including those to Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšín.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railways, there are long--term restrictions on the lines between Prague and Beroun, Prague and Lysá nad Labem and in the area around Kolín.
Travellers will also experience changes at other locations.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or extend the line 420 from Dobříše with a connection to Prague, where PID tickets can be used as far as Milevska.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk were changed and the routes of some buses on the border between Central Bohemia and Horowitz were adjusted in the Pilsen region.
A healthy snack or lunch in the office from a supermarket.
Hello, he works from 9 to 5 with a 30- minute lunch break and his only option to get food is to go to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
In view of the fact that he has no movement, after work he does not have the strength to exercise, he has to eat as healthily and dietarily as possible.
Unfortunately, he never knows what to buy and, in a hurry, buys only pizza bread and a snack of yoghurt and an apple..
The question was what a healthy meal without the need for thermal processing could be bought in a supermarket.
Not everyone waits for a metre of snow like they do, but unfortunately that is the case.
It's not about the trees that must necessarily be seen.
Only the tip of the tree can be hidden under the snow..
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal infection.
I don't say that it is the only reason why they forbid them to drive off the slopes,, but it is one of them.
Dary's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I was not looking forward to this at all.
The Czech showbiz pond has been nothing but the exposure of the relationship between Dary Rolins and Pavel Nedved since Friday.
They have been together since the summer, and the famous football player even broke up with his wife because of the singer.
Dara now sent a lengthy message to her fans, explaining why she kept her love for him a secret for half a year.
Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful football player in Czechia and Slovakia, claims that no one in Czechia or Slovakia is unaware of the fact that Dara has caught a bear, i.e. pardon, Nedvěda., she jokes.
However, he allegedly seduced her, not the other way around.
Three days are the focus of attention, and although they are used to the interest of the public, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
To, which both of them were not looking forward to, but knew that it would happen one day, continues with the singer.
I don't know who is worse off..
Them who are not interested in it at all, and it pops up on them even from cans,, or us,, whose lives are scrutinized to the minutest detail.
As if someone wanted to hear the opinion of one of them on whether they fit together with their husband or their girlfriend, or whether they insisted on everyone knowing in detail the list of their former partners and being aware of the list of their mistakes and failures.
That's the way to do it, that's what I want, says Dare..
The couple met in Italy, where Rolins was working on her new fashion collection.
NEDvěd has been working as vice president of football club Juventus for a long time..
They came out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for the end of Nedvěd's divorce.
With his wife Ivana, they have been estranged for three years, they are not officially divorced but have only been separated for three weeks.
In any case, those who rejoice with us and wish them well are to be thanked.
We are just people, they have families, children, pasts and dreams..
They are not perfect, but I think they both have their hearts in the right place..
And that's why she loves her new man, and he loves her, just as she loves him, in good times and bad. Rolins concluded..
Ahoy, the other commentators have probably already said all the important things, but I can confirm that the dorms are great in the beginning, most of my classmates got to know each other and made friends during the first semester or two, and then they found housing together, which is the best option, because they know who they will be living with.
Apartments are usually not advertised for a long time in advance, so there is not much to find now, but it does not hurt to take a look at the offer.
He should avoid not only Cejlu, but also the surrounding areas ( streets such as Vranovska, Francouzska, it is not a good address) as well as some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří quarter is full of students, Královo pole and in that direction is good, apart from the fact that it is close to most of the faculties of VUT..
I have never had to look for accommodation, but he is a native of Brno, so he may be able to give advice on Brno as such, if he still has any information missing..
This is an example of "normal" thinking.
As a result of the decisions made by some doctors somewhere in Poland, it is actually perfectly normal that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
They can either teach what they want and pay for it themselves or they can follow the state curriculum and be paid by the state.
They can't allow a private actor to take over a piece of education just because it adds a few cents to the state subsidy and allows it to teach whatever it wants in schools.
This statement loses some of its weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier expressed himself in the same way about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state.
So, a vote against the idea of someone going for an abortion is the same as a vote against the idea of a statue standing in the square.
I would have consulted directly with the person who gave him the job..
In fact, during the cataloging or digitalization, he has already experienced that (and that even long--standing professionals) they either put something according to the eye or they write something in the manner of xxx *** or ... ( according to convention ) and in the notes that it is unreadable.
The truth is that, in this case, it is quite legible, so it is probably not a good idea to translate it in its entirety.
Personally, I would have dealt with this in a footnote according to the type of program used.
If he wanted to be a conscientious and diligent student, he could look in some symbolic databases and find the nearest one.
However, because it looks as if it is based on some books, I would guess that the author or printer simply created his own own mark, which fits with what is physically on the coin.
PS: It is not a coincidence that it is more of an Odryska empire ( kingdom ) than an Odrynska one.
PSS:someone has already figured it out here..
Looking at that comment with Φιλh.
Politicians do not know what will be the " theme " of their presidency.
This is a much worse fiasco than having interpreters with them.
The idea that something would be approved because nobody understood a text is laughable.
All important approved documents are scrutinized word for word, and a basic knowledge of English is not enough, that is the job of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various institutions of the EU, politicians prefer English for informal contacts and for establishing special relationships.
In addition, with the English, it is quite interesting, after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
I don't understand the hate on Cézanne..
He has been working there for the third year and he is doing well.
He has driven from work at 10 p.m. many times and never had any problems.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly ever been there..
Yes, most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is to block the pavement and park where they are not allowed to. It is certainly not the case that one would be afraid to go out on the street after dark.
So, if you are looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the centre,, I would go for it.
There are a lot of newly renovated or newly built apartments there now.
Félix Slováček (78) without Dáda or Gelemová as a stumbling block.
Where they will spend Christmas.
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not..
He does not have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
Daddy's wreath I have seen and Lucie probably has one as well, said the Saxophonist of Blesku, who thus confirmed the words of Patrasová that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in the Vinohrady district, where Dada stayed alone after his departure.
Slaváček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently, they met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
Video: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Zase Together.
Félix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Zase Together.
However, they still had something to talk about, so they didn't break up for Christmas.
I don't know where he will be.
Gifts are bought on an ongoing basis and Dad and Lucia will probably get something. maybe perfume.
I am a gentleman, Felix added, who himself came to the club Richman for the premiere of the music video.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone..
Says Mr. Slováček, he always finds someone with whom he likes to have a good time, and he was glad to meet his wife, Luďka Soboty Adrian, or singer Kamila Nývlt.
He made this clear.
And we have Iceland, so that they can afford not to have soldiers and weapons.
I doubt that anyone would be willing to defend them on their behalf, and their location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot to not occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it would be a bad argument, so they should explain it to me.
He does not know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are not enough policemen and they cannot afford it, so the firefighters and nowhere else have such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a high level.
The fact that the army is capable of defending Ostrava to the hilt goes against the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not be just a factory for food, said the journalist.
Czechia is going through the worst period of drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the amount of water has decreased in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, precipitation has also decreased in areas where water scarcity was not a problem.
The cause of the drought that affects a large part of central Europe is climate change.
However, the effects are amplified by the manner in which the land is managed..
What to prepare for in connection with the drought.
And how they can help nature in difficult times.
That's how it will be, barely able to stay on skates on the ice, I know what it is to play ice hockey, and the tactics (which he tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a bit of a gamble.
If the team is called the "Russian bear" or the " Chinese lamb " then losing by two goals, even though it is not necessary to win the match, is different from when it is compared.
But as it is, what the Czech commentators pay attention to, what the referees notice or do not notice in men's or women's hockey, is all strange, but that is the way it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, atd.
Controversy is everywhere.
And in my opinion, if it was the other way around, it would be the same as always, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than they have won, and that it would be a classic "they lost " vs " we won".
Coronavirus: the number of cases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.

Greater waves of infections caused by the Omikron strain are inevitable, said Dr. Susan Hopkinsová, the chief medical adviser to the British Health Security Agency on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already being hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their numbers to increase.
So far, no one has died of omicron, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
The leader of the British Labour Party, Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that it is likely that Boris Johnson broke the law by holding a Christmas party in Downing Street in December 2019, when a lockdown was in effect and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister in Johnson's government defended the quiz as having taken place " virtually " over a computer.
However, in Downing Street, groups of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the post of Prime Minister is growing..
During last year's December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties in defiance of the lockdown.
The British public and the media are outraged that Johnson and his government are making fun of them.
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
In the morning, the Conservative Party spoke of the need to remove him from the post of Prime Minister.
It is remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
They want to turn around and save their skin.
In the spring of 2018, elections will be held in Hungary, which may end twelve years of rule by Viktor Orbán.
This will be an election of European significance.
How much it is expected that they will be fair.
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free, because they were not free in the last two elections under Orbán.
HIs party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit from it, and does other smaller or larger tricks.
The current one is that everyone can in practice choose where they want to vote.
This allows Fidesz to mobilize voters from certain precincts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So, I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
They think it will be just as unfair as in 2014 and 2018.
After all, the situation is fundamentally different.
It used to be about whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the united opposition.
For Viktor Orbán and his party, this is a big change..
They will not try to maintain power by playing even harder.
Yes, there are some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently leaked audio recordings of the chairman of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, reveal that the head of the secret services told him that the opposition is a threat to national security.
These are the signs of a new approach that they are talking about.
Yes, this is one of the new features..
Everything starts with language.
She was beaten quite often, the last time at the age of 14, her parents, her mother has little patience, she herself has little patience, her father has had it for a long time, but then he blows up violently (only in relation to her).
At the same time, she was very choleric and she was very angry as a little girl, to such an extent that she lay on the ground in convulsions and was all blue, twice she was taken under the shower to calm down.
Sometime they slapped him in a disciplinary way, sometimes it was more that they didn't know what to do with him.
At the moment, I also have a tendency to resolve things violently, as a child she was quite aggressive, now she would at least hit something to vent her anger, and as a younger person she would hit her parents over the arm (so that she would not get too much of a slap on the wrist) so that she never did anything extreme, but always had the urge to do so..
It is not possible to determine to what extent this is due to her explosiveness, but there is no doubt that her upbringing has also played a part in this.
I'm afraid that he will also lose patience with his children and deal with it in the same way.
I think that beating children is simply wrong, and that their parents should not have done it, especially not in that moment, when it was no longer " educational " but out of frustration, on the other hand, every parent is bound to mess up their children to some extent, so they should not be blamed.
It doesn't bother me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call those who create laws in such a quality.
Otherwise, it would be interesting to know whether they are afraid of a drop in income.
It is possible to count on the fact that people want and buy the product and that we will have enough money to pay for a mortgage.
Kocner's bizarre world.
Where Slovakia will move on the case of the murdered journalist Kuciak.
In Slovakia, the main trial in the murder case of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušníorová begins.
The death of the investigative journalist and his partner changed Slovakia.
It stirred up the civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the Slovak political and judicial elite.
how significant the breakthrough will be for Slovakia.
For this, the journalists are responsible..
It is possible that this petition attracted much more media attention than the counter- petition by the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later.
No, they were fooled and the company got away with it.

The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the disposal site is nowhere to be found.
Minster Karla Havlíčka's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of communities and their citizens in the selection and approval of deep geological repositories for high--level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of the draft, which the Ministry of Industry and Trade presented to the government after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious disagreement not only with the affected municipalities united in the Platform against deep underground storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Towns of the Republic of Croatia.
The municipalities, according to the law of 2011, are expected to have a more significant strengthening of their powers in deciding on the disposal sites, which the mayors have been promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is also demanded by the Czech nuclear law and the European directive.
It is expected that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will rework the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The draft law proposed by Minister Karla Havlíčka, which Platforma has at its disposal, is criticized by the municipalities in particular : The proposed level of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the location of the disposal site is insufficient and cannot guarantee respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
In practice, it is only effective when the cities or the public can influence whether or not the process will continue in a given location.
This can be achieved by requiring the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) to seek the consent of the affected communities before commencing a specific case.
The draft proposal for the project almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities little more than mere statistics in the permitting procedures.
The draft lacks a systematic approach to compensation for communities for the entire process of searching for and choosing a site for a repository, its approval and operation.
The representatives of the municipalities, according to today's legal norms, do not have many opportunities to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a site for the disposal facility.
Only in some licensing proceedings, they can submit their objections or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or the minister in whose interest the licence is issued.
A possible lawsuit does not have an interim effect on the execution of surveying or construction works.
The Platform's demand for joint decision--making by the self---governments is a principle that is commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those that have already advanced in the permitting of storage facilities, as in Sweden and Finland.
The preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm Havel & Partners s.r.o., which was signed by SÚRAO and followed by contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total sum for these works, according to the register of contracts, amounts to almost 4 million Czech crowns.
Antonín Seknička, the deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and the spokesman for the Platform against the deep geological repository of highly radioactive waste said: After the Minister of Industry, who merely downgraded the position of local authorities vis--às with the state authorities in the search for a deep geological repository of highly radioactive waste,, the new government is waiting for a more significant turnaround.
They also offer a helping hand.
They also thank the Association of Municipalities and Towns, which also considers the problem of insufficient rights of municipalities in such important construction projects to be similar to those of directly affected municipalities in the selected localities.
The Platform Against Deep Underground Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) for the purpose of advocating a change in the state's approach to the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which is not limited to a deep underground repository.
The Platform also advocates that decisions on the selection of a location for possible disposal must be preceded by the approval of the affected municipalities.
Herce John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight because he lost 90 kg.
Despite his lifestyle, he did not feel the need to change anything for a long time, but he was finally frightened by the doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked..
Goodman lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kilograms, according to the newspaper The Sun.
He introduced his new character at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The man from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person.
John joked that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture to break.
"I put everything in his mouth," the actor said in 2018 in an interview with AARP.

It also depends on which boss and what one wants to use the word "boss" for.
If it's a text for a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment,, I wouldn't translate it.
If it was a formal text, and perhaps a university text,, he would have looked for ways to better describe or explain the bosses.
There are many different types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls has several bosses, that is, the "boss" is something like the lord or ruler of a certain level, and then there is a final boss.
In many games, there are hidden bosses ( super boss, hidden boss ) that are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but they are often stronger than standard bosses.
In games such as Half--Life, bosses are present, but the player does not directly engage with them ( Tentacle, Gargantua ) and they can be described in general terms.
And then there are mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate boss in a single word in any language, the Czech and other languages do not deal with it in any way (e.g. Catalan, which translates boss as final enemy).
It is important for the story or the game in general for the computer- controlled opponent to be stronger than all the previous ones and to be guarding the completion of some levels or tasks.
After the missing Petra from London, the whole world is looking for her..
The Czech police also took part..
After the missing Petra Srncova, the British police are looking for her since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search..
The 32--year old woman from the Uherskohradsko region has been missing since 7 December.
Together with Interpol, Skrz also helps the British police.
Czech Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
The British police have been looking for her since 3 December.
Interpol issued a yellow notice for her..
After Petra, the whole world is looking for him..
The Czech police cooperates closely with the British police, said police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"They share information about the case, " she added.
The search for Petra was already announced on the police website..
He is 168 centimetres tall, is slim and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same colour.
It should come from Uherské Hradě..
Pete worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Her friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Harriet Harman, a British Member of Parliament, was also involved in the search for Petra..
She took part in the distribution of leaflets with the face of Petra.
"We are very worried about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have detained one suspect.
However, it is not clear who this person is and what he had in common with Petra.
Before Christmas, the Czech Republic terrorized Agent Tesla.
Whilst data for October indicated a slight decline in the number of attack campaigns, the previous month saw an increase in the number of attacks as the end of the year approached.
A large campaign in relation to Agent Tesla was observed on 18 November..
The attacks are aimed at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for the time being.
The infected attachment in the e--mail is designed to attract the attention of the user with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
Unlike the previous month, the dangerous attachment had the word " invoice " in its name, this time it was called " Copies of repaired receipts for 11,2021 ... " by Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird.
The malicious code actively searches for stored access codes and then transmits them to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in Czechia at the end of August and the beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is again increasing.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active..
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case did not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November detected more global campaigns.
Compared to the October data for Formbook, it weakened slightly, but still accounted for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks occurred continuously throughout the month, with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th and 15th of November.
Formbook contained the most common attachment with the suffix .exe, named Request for Specification.
However, the name receipt is still used.
The attachment in Czech may be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
According to security analysts, the program Fareit, which accounted for 1.6 percent of the attacks and had no major campaigns in the Czech Republic in the last few months, saw a significant drop in activity.

The parade in Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the riverbank and according to his experience, the demonstrator did not fear an estimate of around 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the quayside and the bridge and the adjacent quayside road.
This means that people really a lot.
Around 40,000 demonstrators marched spontaneously, accompanied by an unprecedented number of passers-by.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or classes of the population led to them finding common ground.
Only the antivaxers, antirouškaři and spol. were able to fill and pay for such a large procession..

It is hard to say what kind of movement would come out of this dissatisfaction, which depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the quadruple vaccine from Pfizer does not become a quintuple or more vaccine.
It will certainly not be a left-- or centrist movement. that's for sure.
The trivalent vaccine is almost certainly going to become a quadrivalent vaccine because it is clear that it will have to be re-vaccinated every six months.
I'm very happy that the vaccines saved them.

The end of the foot, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing change.
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev entrusted the formation of a new government to Kiril Petkov from the anti--corruption movement Pokračujeme in Change, which won the November elections.
It has managed to form a broad coalition government that will take office within a few days..
The political crisis in the country has lasted since April, when the previous government, under pressure from anti- corruption protests, lost the elections.
The victorious parties proclaiming a struggle against corruption and abuse of power were unable to reach an agreement, so there were two more early elections.

In the United Kingdom over the weekend, fears grew over the fate of a 32- year old Czech woman, who has been missing for several days. London police are looking for her.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago, when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, the woman's former employer or the member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived were called in.
The disappearance of Petra bears no resemblance to her usual behaviour and the police in the Lambeth district, where she worked, are becoming increasingly concerned,, said Lucy O'Connor from the police station in the Lambeth district, where Srncová worked, in a Saturday video.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is. she continued.
The missing Czech, according to her, left work on Sunday 28 November at around 7.45pm and headed home to the area of Camberwell.
The last time it was reportedly seen was in an autobus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on 3 December.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy 's and St Thomas ' Hospital group.
The group of medical facilities said in a tweet that they were worried about their colleague Petra, who was missing.
"They wanted to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her find her way home to contact the police. "

In Ústí nad Labem, for a month, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a lid was dug..
It was a matter of life and death.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the RSD, which owns the roads, and because it did not react, the hole continued to widen.
Finally, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the ŘSD began to "intensely resolve " the situation.
