The big return of the Czech smoker is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, returns to the NHL.
The 32- year old Plzeň native is on the bench and could soon be in the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvinov, Plzeň or Chinese Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of last year.
Exactly in the middle of the game against Vegas, he was replaced and has not appeared on the ice in the NHL since then.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper passed from one goalpost to the other.
Pavel Francouz will be out of action for approximately three to four weeks with an injury to his lower body, Denver announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL lasted more than two months.
On Sunday morning, American time, he was called from the farm where he caught four ducks and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he recorded 94.5 % of the saves.
A former Plzeň hockey player wants to finally prove that he belongs to the best league in the world..
In the last season he had problems with his knees and in the shortened pandemic season he did not play a single match.
In the NHL, he played 36 games, his success rate was 92.3%..
Charles wears a mask for his Christmas wish, William and Kate pose in Jordan.
The British prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish.
Prince Charles also revealed his wishes,, using a photograph in which his wife Camille helps him to put on a mask.
On its website, the British broadcaster BBC reported on this.
Wishes are sent to friends, colleagues and charities with which they collaborate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color and the dress also has Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same uniform as Prince George and Prince Louis, consisting of shorts and a shirt with a neckband.
The photographer is not known and neither William and Kate have stated when it was taken.
The royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas greeting on a pile of hay in front of a heap of wood in their country estate in the county of Norfolk.
The picture, which serves as a Christmas greeting, was also released by successor to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
The photographer Sam Hussein captured him in June at the Ascot races.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her colored mask that matches her white dress.
According to efotbal.CS, Slavia promised Berbrovi a million for the title, Tvrdik denied it.
In the current corruption case, the criminal investigators apparently worked with the idea that the former vice president of the Football Association of Croatia Roman Berbr had been promised a million kuna for the league title in the 2018-19 season.
According to efotbal.CZ, he received a part of the police files.
The president of the Vršovacki club, Jaroslav Tvrdik, said that there was no corrupt behavior on the part of the red- and whites.
The server published police recordings in which Slavia's former sports director, Jan Nezmar, features prominently. Nezmar left the club in the summer of 2016.
The former influential communist functionary was, according to the report, in frequent contact with both Berbrem and the former sports director of the second division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogozem,, who is also involved in the case.
Criminal investigators apparently worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi had promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the team of SK Slavia won the title in the first league.
The police organization had information that Roman ( Berbr ) from Slavia had been promised a million-aire bribe from the club's officials.
A day later, according to the criminalists, Berbr met not only with Nezmare, but also with Slavia chairman Tvrdiik.
According to the server, it is not clear whether the police are still investigating this information.
Tvrdik rejected all forms of corruption.
In the years 2015 to 2017, they actively tried to change the balance in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
They have never been involved in illegal activities, have not attempted to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and have not given any financial support to anyone in this connection. Tvrdik said for Seznam Zprávy.
In the broadcasts after the match, Nezmar, in an uncontrolled manner, slanders some of the former Slavia players with dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrdić.
The case of alleged manipulation of matches through referees began with a police raid on several locations, including the FAČR headquarters in mid- October 2014.
The most prominent figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football functions.
In mid- January, as well as former Vyšehrad sports director Rogoz, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
The new guns are of a worse type ( the artillerymen have to fire from armored bunkers and carry ammunition by hand without protection )
The Toyoty hi-lux are new and good.
Tank and armored vehicles - on a decent level, in addition, it has managed to get rid of the Pragy V3S in specialized units.
Aircrafts - good, but at the end of their service life, in terms of transport, very small and with a short flight range, but modern.
Drones - they are small and only have a limited combat potential.
Rackets - they do not have any ( but they manufacture and export them to foreign countries )
PVO - medium - cold war and obsolete, short range - good, modern and relatively good numbers.
She has such a story.
There is a cemetery right next to the city.
There were nutria in the rivers and they did damage to the crops, so he was sitting there.
When he arrived, he saw that on the other side of the river there was a fisherman.
He didn't want to make a mess, so he sat down quietly and the guy didn't notice him.
He hoped that it would leave, before anything emerged,, but after a while a fox appeared.
He allowed her to come to 40 metres before deciding to shoot.
A poor fisherman was nearly drowned, was hit by waves from all sides, and then called out to him that it was a seal.
Before he left the palace, he was drunk.
In other words, the grass may be greener on the other side.
On the other side, it is not a war, it would have required a lot of coincidences for something to happen, and it is likely that he would have been seen on thermal imaging, which is used by almost everyone today.
In a visible place, valuable things should be kept close to the feet in the sleeping bag, and he would have been in a good mood.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Nitro obtained respiratory masks significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state responsible for the purchase and distribution of roušes, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus has spent millions of crowns on their production in recent weeks.
The radio station iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the amounts of respirators differed by hundreds of crowns on a single day.
The reason for the dramatic change in prices.
The offices that behaved in a hospodarian manner.
and others bought it for more money.
Lenka Kabrhelová talks with the iRozhlas reporter Dominika Kubišto.
Soldiers and armies are respected ( as the older generation is not affected by the memories of the People's Army, but the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from compulsory military service.
The army does not have large stocks of modern equipment, which could be used by newly trained soldiers, it does not have modern equipment for the existing professionals, and modern equipment is becoming more and more difficult to use, so the capabilities of reservists are rapidly decreasing in time.
In addition to the modern conventional conflicts,, where each side can deploy,, are taking place very quickly and there is no time to retrain anyone again.
And finally, the reserves and territorial defense have great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrilla warfare is conducted and it is an absolute necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight is only possible in a conflict of this scale and intensity, where guerrilla warfare is irrelevant, and there is no suitable geography for it.
They lack individual skills.
It is not the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it..
In such a situation, a player who 2 minutes later failed to hit an empty goal, ran into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss players and said, " it's a goal and that's what is going to happen now. ".
However, he is not obliged to pay as much as the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill " to provoke the defender " is so terrible that he was genuinely surprised when he saw that the team's attacker managed to outwit one player from the opposing team.
The first swallows.
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but no major change is expected in the following weeks.
The pressure on hospitals according to statistical models is expected to continue for some time, and a new, unknown variant, Omikron, which is likely to spread more rapidly than the currently predominant Delta, has been added to the pandemic equation.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty that it can cause a more serious course, to the extent that it is helped by vaccination or post-- infection immunity gained from previous infection.
However, this week, the covid equation also included an unexpected phenomenon on the side of the pluses: the possibility of healing.
A new antiviral drug, molnupiravir, arrived in Czechia, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and hospitalization by a third, and it is possible to treat it at home.
Pfizer's new antibiotic, paxlovid, is expected to be added to the arsenal soon, as it has a success rate of 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to Czechia, in addition to the hope of expanding the arsenal of useful tools in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the country's administration was prepared for the arrival of new drugs.
It was said that the first batch of molnupiravir would be sent to domestic patients from the Merck company.
The company ended up on the list as first because it started developing the drug long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for viral diseases affecting horses in South America.
In this research, it is often overlooked that people in the West ( Germany and Sweden, etc. )
They are generally less open and less willing to share their opinions..
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially the Czechs, are accustomed to speaking " as their beaks grew.
I did a study where people were asked whether they liked Muslims.
In Czech, the vast majority of people say that they do not.
In the West, they say that they love migration, that everyone should help them and that the Czechs are racist hovads.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their job and being subjected to media lynching.
In the surveys, the west looks good and the east looks bad.
But he finds out what people really think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour have more than 20 % according to a survey.
They know that the objects are three and completely identical.
This is due to the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers would not have to relearn where everything is, so all the buildings are identical.
One is the Atom Muzeum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
It is strange that the Soviet Union did not want to have nuclear heads on its own territory for reasons of safety or speed of deployment due to its more western position.
In the underground bunkers ( there are two in each yew tree ) only the heads of the missiles were stored,, not the entire missiles.
In order to deploy this weapon, a special unit was sent, which lifted the head and mounted it on some kind of support equipment..
In addition to the museum's javelins, those remaining in a desolated state.
In the second grade of the elementary school, he had a classmate Cigána, for four years.
He was in a good mood, made good jokes and often overexposed himself, but he was the team's mascot.
He talked to him every day, he often went to him and wanted to explain something, he lacked nothing, he went to him regularly, he devoted himself to sports with them and he didn't steal rations or telephones. he was cleanly dressed.
He also went on school trips to the countryside, took part in various zoology projects, and never made a fuss..
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings and gypsies entered the same year and other classes.
Shortly afterwards, they beat the teacher, the police intervened frequently, they threatened and intimidated other students.
Personally, he sometimes sells something on an advertisement ( old things, things he does not need, etc. ) and he has often sold Cigans for money, they did not try to make any attempts to cheat him on the price and the communication was calm.
He even sold a car to a boy who called him a month later to say that he had rewritten the contract.
As for himself, he says that he is not a racist and that he does not care whether the person is white, black, yellow or other, as long as he behaves in a decent society ( works, functions and women do not beat ) .
As soon as someone comes, stretches out his hand, steals apartments and houses, has around him nothing but chaos and causes problems. but it doesn't matter whether he is black or white.
He does not have a problem with African migrants, if they stay in the country and begin to work, learn the language ( not necessarily, at least the English language ) and respect the country's culture.
As long as they respect his traditions and culture, he will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in the Prachatick region.
The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts she died at the scene, according to Právu's spokeswoman, Zuzana Fajtlov.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl..
The 18--year old driver of the Peugeot vehicles was probably travelling in the direction of the village of Žichovec to the village of Bavorov and lost control of the vehicle in a turn in the opposite direction.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on the roof of a building outside the road, described the accident by police spokeswoman Stéphanie Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It was a multiple injury and he was trapped in the vehicle.
After he was freed, he had to be given emergency pre-- hospital care and he was transported by air to the hospital in Budějovice in a stable condition, the rescue worker Fajtlov said.
The man in the second vehicle suffered a minor injury to his chest and was taken to the hospital.
For baggage from countries outside the EU, new rules have been introduced and passengers often fail to provide details.
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month..
He collects mainly collector's cards.
" Normally, it can be tens of dollars, for example, up to ten dollars, where it still makes sense to import from Japan, where the post office is often free of charge. " approximates the collector.
Since October, the cost of delivering small parcels has increased slightly, they must now add DPH and postage and submit details for customs control.
He receives a letter from the customs that they expect the package to arrive.
It is necessary to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the DPH was not included in the initial sale, the customs authority will determine it from the total amount of the shipment and the transport.
In the event that the recipient does not undertake the customs clearance himself, he must also add to the total amount the freightage of the carrier.
According to Lukáše Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
Press one or two trigger buttons, inserts two inserts and is done..
For him, it is usually a matter of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
Not all deliveries go smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of international shipments received at the international post office in Prague fell from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests to provide information necessary for the completion of customs procedures..
At the moment, there are 30,000 parcels waiting to be processed at the international post office.
If people filled in all the necessary details and did so in time, they would have been roughly halfway through by the end of the day, according to Czech Post spokesperson Matyas Vitik.
Solving inflation
According to the title,, they proposed a solution to the current inflation.
Currently, the inflation rate is 9.9 percent and it is expected to rise.
What they want the state to do in order to slow down or compensate for this growth.
For example, the reduction of DPH on food and fuel in Poland, this is the way.
What they think is going to happen, what is inevitable with it, where it is heading.
Wages rise more slowly than prices, according to him, it is unavoidable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How many of them have been added ( those who are employed )
His salary was increased by 2 percent, this is a disgrace, but fortunately he has a similar income from his business..
It is not possible to explain why those who have been proven to be violent criminals are sentenced to only 6 months in prison..
It is hard to understand how a court can send such a beast to jail for only 6 months, and then release him immediately..
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that its victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting its sexual relationships and relationships in general.
And in addition to this, the victim of rape may never recover from the trauma..
This does not apply to potential future victims of sexual assault.
The man from Hrobo " shot " his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The man from Hrobo accidentally helped the guards to detain his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was issued a warrant to arrest her.
He himself called her to him.
However, he took a detour..
He first approached a passerby and invented a story that he had been robbed.
The guards arrived at the scene after being called in on the emergency line and were stunned when the alleged " robbed " told them that he made up the story to get the guards to come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the guards on how to report to the Police of the Republic of Croatia.
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the guards discovered that the woman is on the list of wanted persons and is the subject of a nationwide manhunt.
The case is being investigated by the police.
A sincere question for the people there, who consider their country to be Slavic.
Personally, he is of the opinion that the Slavs have been ethnically and culturally different for a long time, and he is interested in the opinion of others.
Jinak with memem, he also agrees that it is a shame that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague.
However, they do not deny that they have a Slavic language.
I don't know whether it is possible for a rational person to believe something completely without evidence simply because it may potentially bring benefits.
A case like this would not be considered true faith by him personally.
Together with Pascalem, it is impossible to agree on the existence of approximately 10,000 different religions in the world.
Whose god or gods a person chooses.
He said that it is likely that in some of the thousands of religions, there is at least one god who punishes those who believe in another god.
However, in the 10th century, it was established that there is no other god other than the god of Jahve.
In this case, it would have been more rational to avoid believing in any god, rather than risking being sent to hell or some other similar place by the one true god that he had missed..
Other - voluntary training and subsequent placement in the reserve.
The Swiss model is probably similar.
Six months of training ( in different specializations, six months in one ) and under the command of professional officers with practical experience.
If a person does well, he may be offered a professional contract.
All the units of the AČR would benefit from something like this.
This could have been done in cooperation with the Military University.
They are constantly talking about the cooperation between the educational sector and the industry, the factories are recruiting from the schools and there is a sort of intermingling, where the workforce is migrating from the educational institutions to the workplace.
Not only during adolescence,, but this process goes on constantly, everyone is constantly learning new things and moving from one field to another.
A similar blending between the civilian and military sectors should also occur.
He also sees it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, the institution that guarantees that no Russian, German or Mongolian invader will ever invade.
It is amusing that they consider NATO to be something carved into stone, they have allies who will defend them if things go wrong.
I don't want to be a man..
Just one election in the United States that crushes their budget and destroys NATO.
The English exchange them for Russian money, the Germans exchange them for Russian gas and the Poles have already once demonstrated that they are willing to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has been able to function as a guarantor of independence for a long time is an army armed to the teeth and a population that is able to operate the military technology of its time.
Today, every teenager is able to pilot remotely controlled devices., so that this was not possible.
They don't need the border fortifications, they are obsolete now, but the aggressive teenager with a remote--controlled device can handle it.
As the crab box tsunami sweeps over them.
They open the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly find themselves surrounded by boxes and fillings.
This " waste " is used again by e--shops, which lack packaging materials.
This is the result of a map of the shops where used cigarette boxes are welcomed..
It's not just for Christmas..
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a waste to treat them as one--time waste.
Anyone can bring to the participating shop ( there are nearly 150 of them in the KAMsNim. project map ) a cardboard box, a plastic or paper filling.
Tím supports small firms, reduces the amount of waste produced and avoids overcrowded blue containers.
The individual businesses welcome the shortage of packaging and the saved money, since packaging cardboard has increased in price by 50 % over the last period.
For the eyes of ecologically minded consumers, this also strengthens its brand.
One of these businesses is Tierra Verde, a producer of ecological drugs and ecological cosmetics.
Cases and filler material are transported to Popůve by individuals, who have accumulated them at home,, but also firms, with whom they have agreed on regular removals of cartons..
All of these are used in the packing of goods from the company's shop.
Thanks to individuals and firms working together, the world has become more respectful.
Their wish is to preserve the sources and beauty of nature for future generations, according to Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The Kamsnim website, however, shows not only the locations of waste disposal..
It serves as a searcher, if one needs to get rid of something ( to get rid of waste from the household, to dispose of expired medicines, tyres, worn--out electrics, batteries, light sources and large amounts of waste).
All the waste ends up in the right place, and reusable items find their second home..
The total map of the project includes more than 100,000 such locations..
"Over time, they are added with collection yards, recycling centers, textile and food banks, charitable shops and other places that help to find use for things that would otherwise become waste,, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
In the present day, technology is so simple and stupid that children who use computers or telephones to play games do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem ( mainly in English articles ) has emerged that students at high schools do not understand the principle of components on computers.
Because, for example, Google Photography or Apple applications on photography or, more generally, mobile telephones in general hide the underlying filesystem with components and everything is displayed on one screen in the application.
It is possible to use the technique from childhood,, but mainly to learn something.
They are changing the history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron announced his priorities for the French presidency of the EU, which begins in January,, and it was grandiose.
Macron spoke for more than an hour, during which he revealed the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans in their work and on the streets, and mentioned so many events that it would be impossible to complete them in half a year.
However, French politicians like it, and it is liked by voters.
Macron's supporters are divided between the right and the left, but they are united on the issue of Europe.
In France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and that France is prepared to create conditions for such work.
A number of commentators immediately jumped in to criticize Macron for his pro--European propaganda and for rewriting history.
In fact, it is trying to rewrite history.
The right--wing candidate for the French presidency, Eric Zemmour is currently touring France with his thesis that the regime of Vichy, which collaborated with Hitler during the Second World War, was not as bad, and has had some success with this among the French.
Taking Macron's idea for one history lesson seriously and ignoring what is happening in France.
It was not necessary.
Students in European countries are often taught history as a story of the oppressed versus the oppressors and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French and the Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
However, if they do not have an enlightened conductor, they do not know the wider context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida.
The Czech " Mice " did not win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenici in 1995, also won awards for directing and for the best actress, Jasna Duricic.
At the 2014 Karlovac Film Festival, it was on the first place of the audience ratings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Otec.
He is not very young, he is not very healthy and he is not vaccinated.
It was like having chickenpox or being sick. for a few days he had diarrhea and didn't feel like smoking.
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
With chickenpox, he does not have diarrhea.
(This is based on personal experience, it is not true for all.)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, published on 20 December, contains a traditional literary supplement.
Along with her, there are also cultural tips..

Trains begin to run according to the new schedule, in some places the carriers change.
From Sunday onwards, trains began to operate according to the new timetable..
The biggest change is the replacement of transport companies on some routes, such as between Ústím nad Labem and Kolin, where instead of Czech Railways, RegioJet begins to operate.
In most lines, only the departure time is changed,, and sometimes the route is slightly altered.
There are also hundreds of new trains on the tracks..
The transport companies started selling tickets during the autumn..
Czeche Railways plan to operate 6,783 passenger trains per day on average, of which 478 are long- distance trains.
Trains travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
Alongside the domestic connections, the new flight schedule also includes flights to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, together with the new timetable, introduces hundreds of new trains.
The main innovation is the Interjet flights, which will operate on routes from Prague to Cheb.
More new trains will be deployed in northern Moravia or western Bohemia..
The transport company also increased the price of the ticket by 3.2 percent from the next year.
The railways take into account inflation in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJetu schedule is the introduction of line R23 from Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolin.
The airline is replacing Czech Airlines after its success in the Ministry of Transport competition..
Every day, RegioJet operates a total of 16 routes, eight in each direction.
Other changes involve long- distance flights between Prague and Brno, which now also stop at stations in Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolin.
Leo Express kept its 16 routes, two return flights to Slovakia and also weekend flights to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the transport company tried to maintain as similar as possible the flight times of its long--distance flights despite the planned stoppages.
With few changes, the operation of Arrivy and other carriers would continue.
Trains are also exchanged in some regional routes.
For example, passengers on the line from Mladé Boleslavi via Českolipski to Rumburak are transported by Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn..
Passengers will also be able to use the unified fare on the railways for the second year..
Likewise, the price of their tickets increased by 3.2 percent due to inflation.
I don't agree.
It's hard to see the other side of the coin.
Everywhere, people heard that they had to fight hard for their rights, that they were oppressed and had to work hard and die.
In life, he has never heard a lecture from the point of view of the slaveholding side or from that time, no one defends it or condemns it.
No one tells this in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one is taught in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they say that the Europeans brutally killed them, but they were killing each other long before.
For a while, he also spent time in the United States, at schools directly, in northern schools and in southern ones.
He has never been involved in a case of deliberate falsification of facts, but he has heard that it has happened and that it is a problem, which he does not deny ( for example, in Japan, the atrocities of World War II are taboo ).
His main point was that history is not black and white and that people tend to view it from the perspective of today, without understanding.
History is not interested in people's feelings, it is as it is, and I think that it is a fatal mistake to condemn people without looking at the circumstances of the time.
On the other side, they should learn from it and never do it again.
When it comes to the southern states,, the confederate flag and the slave owners are quite popular there,, but they also had some of their own successes and it is absurd to denounce them.
In addition,, the North was not much better than what many people idealize it to be in the present day.
A lot of people also forget that not all people in the South were slave owners and that they were also opposed to many things.
This is not comparable with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, in addition, there is no such perspective in them ( there was also a video from television, in which someone started talking about the legionnaires and 1968).
One of the things that surprised him about American schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that never occurred in his country.
Overall, he felt that at some universities, the students were so radicalized that the schools were supporting them.
When he imagines that these people will be much older, he is not happy about the possibility that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is also present among young people and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long ago achieved what it wanted, and it is no longer the same. it has become radicalized.
At present, those who call themselves feminists are those who ignore the basic biological fact and ignore other groups such as LGBT, which leads to radicalization on the opposite side, which often leads to opposition to quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is,, the more he is heard.
On the other hand, he has never been accused of colonialism or slavery.
More often than not, he had bad geography,, but this was a two--way thing.
It was not because he didn't like it, but because it is completely unreasonable to him.
He should be proud of something that he was not able to achieve on his own.
In addition, the concept of nationality as a whole is considered unnecessary from the point of view of some personal identity.
If they have something in common with people, interests, views on the world and shared experiences, rather than the place where they were born.
He is not a believer, but from what he knows, he can say that there are two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovakian.
The Slovak priest is a very good guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but he always ends up saying something about the coronavirus, that everyone is afraid of.
And there is also the Czechoslovak Church of the Bohemian Brethren.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they emerged from Catholic modernism and are in fact Catholic without a pope.
He knows many people who are Catholics but go to church with the Hussites because it is theologically similar, but the members are more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on the street Botanica.

Břeclav – Plamínek is in the Czech Republic, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem.
The Scouts did not go to Vienna for the second time because of the pandemic of the coronavirus. they were handed over by their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing of Reintal – Břeclav in the morning..
At the border, they handed it over last year as well.
The Betlém light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that the section participates in every year, enjoys it very much.
It is an honor for her that she was chosen, she said to the present reporters, scout Amalie Budikow.
In contrast to the previous year, the handover took place at the border crossing of Mikulov- Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge,, but now at the border crossing of Reintal – Břeclav on the parking grounds.
Normally, the scouts travel by train to Vienna.
There is no change in the distribution of the candles in the Czech Republic.
With the help of the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally traveled by train first to Brno, where they handed it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle..
On the following distribution of light, on Saturday 18th December, the scout couriers would travel on selected fast trains and passenger trains.
From them, the light will be picked up by the local scouts or volunteers, who then spread the flames across the country and beyond the reach of railways..
This year, scouts must obey the valid measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It is similar to last year.
They are giving advice to the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear masks, try to maintain a safe distance, not to sing to their colleagues and to behave in such a way that it is the most safe. described the spokesperson of the event, the Bethlehem light Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the European pilgrimage of the Betlém light was born in 1986 in Austria.
The purpose is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time with the flame.
The Betlém light is a symbol of hope and light that overcomes darkness for believers.
In Czechia, Scouts and Scoutettes have been responsible for its spread for more than 30 years.
The action is carried out by thousands of volunteers, the candle is also a symbol of non--partisanship and human solidarity.
All the news, including the list of places where people can come to take care of the baby,, can be found on the websites of the Betlemskesvetlo.

Television follows the trend of Christmas films and premiered two hundred of them this year.
Los Angeles - television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English- speaking countries fell into the trend of Christmas films and in 2018 they presented a record number of more than 200 premieres.
Spočítal calculated the film database IMDb's operator.
In recent years, the genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been popular with the audience and has significantly increased the viewership. as a result, more and more of these films have been produced.
In 2012, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice more than in 2007.
The IMDb database, on the other hand, included only those films with the word Christmas ( Vánoce ) in their titles,, so the actual number of Christmas films is much higher.
The films traditionally associated with Christmas have existed since time immemorial.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated especially with fairy tales, and worldwide, films such as Home Alone, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and the classic Christmas film It's a Wonderful Life from 1946 are popular.
However, the boom of Christmas films did not start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark launched a special film series, as reported by the BBC.
Her advent project, Countdown to Christmas ( Countdown to Christmas ) at the time included four films and was very successful.
In 2012, this station began its viewers to tune in for Christmas on 22 October and presented a total of 42 Christmas films.
The competing channel Lifetime has 35 new films with a Christmas theme in its programme this year, as well as popular streaming platforms such as Netflix.
"In this magical period, the story is not as important as the fact that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it is snowing. " Brandon Gray, author of the book on Christmas films called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies ( I will be home for Christmas films )
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to at least for two hours to feel a little bit of calm amidst all of the festive madness and the madness of the world in which they have lived for the last few years,, he added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark Television uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
There are two people who fall in love with each other,, but there is a misunderstanding between them for about half an hour before the end of the film, which is eventually resolved and they kiss.
It's like this all the time, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people watch them one after the other, adds Gray.

California restricts the sale of firearms.
He wants to follow the path of Texas with regard to the prohibition of abortion.
Governor of California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons using the legal mechanism used by Texas' controversial abortion law after detecting the heartbeat of an embryo.
People would then be entitled to compensation in lawsuits against anyone in California who manufactures or sells assault weapons and homemade firearms.
Oznama Newsoma reacted to the Friday decision of the American Supreme Court, which upheld the Texas ban on abortion, although it went against almost 50 years of precedent that established the right to abortion throughout the United States up to the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical issues that arise from the innovative construction of the regulation..
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, thereby preventing the usual court route.
"He was disappointed by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States to allow Texas to maintain its ban on most abortion services and to a large extent support the maneuver of Texas to protect its law. "
"Since now states can block revisions of their laws by federal courts, California is using this privilege to protect human lives. "
His subordinates were instructed to work together with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice to draft a decree that would allow representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so--called ghost weapons.
These weapons are labeled as " home--made " weapons, which do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants the right for citizens to demand compensation of at least 10,000 dollars (220,000 Kč) and court costs from anyone who manufactured, distributed or sold assault weapons in California.
"The most effective way to keep these dreadful weapons out of the streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, and that's exactly what they should do. "
The Associated Press notes that California had banned the manufacture and sale of certain military- style weapons for a decade, but a federal court judge overturned the ban as unconstitutional in June.
If the state actually banned the use of Texas templates, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion on the Friday majority verdict warned of the expansion of this legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the Supreme Court of Texas's ban on abortion did not allow complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against selected officials of the southern state of the United States.

Poland threatened to stop paying into the EU budget.
According to Ziobra, the European Commission acted in violation of the law when it used its new powers and because of the dispute over the legal state, it suspended the payment of money to Poland.
The Commission has already postponed approval of the Polish plan to use 36 million euros from the EU reconstruction fund affected by the pandemic of 1999.
A is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use the mechanism allowing it to withdraw EU funding from countries violating the principles of a legal state.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU's veto in all matters that require unanimity, " said Ziobro, head of the small party Solidarity of Poland, without which the current government would have lost the majority in the Sejm.
"Poland also needs to reconsider its commitments to the European Union's energy and climate policies, which have led to a dramatic increase in energy prices. "
If the dispute continues, he would demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It is unacceptable in view of the fact that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, from which it also contributes. the Polish minister added.
His party's approach to the EU is more radical than that of the governing party Právo and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that took place in Polish justice during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, is setting up " impossible conditions " because its goal is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland.
Warsaw is facing " political dictatorship imposed by blackmail and attempts to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles " according to Ziobro.
He said that Poland should be a member of a European Union based on partnership between sovereign states and not on the rule of the most powerful and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels, the consequences of which would be to reduce Poland's sovereignty.
"We would never accept that Poland would become a colony. "

In his youth, he was punished with a spoon.
It was never because of the marks, it was usually because she refused to listen and was a troublemaker ( she was reading instead of going to sleep, she was fighting with her brothers, etc. )
At the same time, she has never been punished without warning, her mother has always first threatened that if she did it again, she would be hit ( sometimes even after a second " snatching " of a cooking utensil, which she merely picked up and laid down so that she could see it.
Only after repeatedly refusing to listen, he received a number of blows to his buttocks.
Personally, he thinks that physical punishment ( in a reasonable manner and degree ) is beneficial, because the child reacts much more to it than to words.
The most important part is the part with the warning, because it gives the child a choice whether to disobey and be punished, or to obey and avoid punishment.
In the end, he usually only needed to warn her to start listening..

When the famous Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 responded to a journalist's question about the meaning of the Czech constitution, whether it is a sacred document on which oaths are taken and which has been taught in schools since childhood,, or on the other hand, a treaty that can be changed when necessary,, he favored the first interpretation.
Once they agreed on the democratic rules of their life, which at the same time define who they are as a state and its citizens, and with changes are better off.
For example, some nations have their own customs, traditions.
In the same way, the Czechs like to eat knedlíkes with pork and cabbage, as Vojtěch Cepl commented at the time..
However, in recent years, the opinion that the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia needs to be changed has become more common among legal experts..
Leta is tested by situations that its creators ( including Vojtěch Cepl ) could not foresee, such as the behaviour of the directly elected president.
However, in one case, Cepl was right.
All that is known about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be carefully planned..
The institute must be understood and actively defended, only then it can be the key to handling most of the crises that plague societies across history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a sort of order of government consisting of individual rules that define the boundaries within which politicians play their games.
They are afraid that the power will be misused against minorities or individuals, so politicians issue prohibitions.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Cervical cancer does not discriminate, in the FN in Brno, several months old babies are fighting for their lives.
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder on children, there are also cases of severe illness,, especially in recent years.
"They know that children are endangered and affected less than adults, they say that 2 to 5 percent of children are affected compared to adults. " said the head of the Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic of the Faculty of Medicine of the Masaryk University and the University of Belgrade, Petr Dominik.
The course of the disease is usually much easier, lighter and often without symptoms.
However, there are also children who are seriously ill with the coronavirus,, especially in the last period,, he added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are about 100 children who need mild support.
It takes place in the children's infectious diseases clinic.
Very seriously ill children with the coronavirus are being admitted to the ARU in the last few weeks.
The children with post-- COVID syndromes were on the ward continuously throughout the year according to the doctor.
"There is an increase in the number of children with acute cases of pneumonia, which means that they are suffering from pneumonia that requires staying on a resuscitation bed, and that this disease affects both adults and adolescents, as well as several months old babies. "
In the hospitals, there are also children in a serious condition due to the coronavirus.
In the present time, there are children of several months and adolescent age in the hospital., said the head of the hospital.
However, he is happy that there have been no child deaths from the coronavirus in the children's hospital of the FN Brno.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominika, the presence of a psychologist in the children's hospital is an integral part of the cooperation.
At the same time, he also points out the fact that, as with adults,, the vaccination also mitigates the course of the disease and also reduces the occurrence of post--viral syndrome.
"It is also recommended to apply the vaccination doses to children as well,, " the doctor added.

However, the principle of equality between sovereign states applies, and it is precisely the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become a great power only if it works on its integration.
At present, it operates on an economic and political level ( in selected areas ), but it still lacks military integration.
Personally, he thinks that Europe is heading towards federalization.

In addition, the verse says " all American forces " which includes their weapons and that he knows that American complexes are operated only by Americans.

Vicki Holland from Britain mistreated orangutan kosmana Milly.
Disturbing footage shows the moment when the terrified monkey crouched in a toilet bowl, before its cruel owner killed it and mocked it.
Hollandová also fed the apes with sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The magistrate's court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, reported the newspaper The Sun.
The experts in rehabilitating orangutans, who care for Milly after her mistreatment, said that they had never seen an orangutan so distressed.
Milly spent nearly two years in rehabilitation at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued orangutan called Moon.
The four- times mother admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to protected animals.
At the magistrate's court in Gwentu, she was sentenced to 120 days in prison with a one- year suspended sentence.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on keeping animals and was ordered to pay 12,000 korun in court costs.
Leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer said "Milly is in good condition, but the rehabilitation process is still ongoing. "
It took Milly a long time to get used to people again..
Krcila and hid herself from everyone she met and from any loud sound or sudden movement that made her scream.
Opička refused to eat for a long time.
Now, when she has settled down and is happy with the male,, she may still be frightened by the sight of new people.
The psychological scars from the abuse will haunt her forever, Sawyer says.
The abuse of Milly was revealed after police in Gwent found disturbing footage in the woman's phone after a raid on her home following accusations of drug use.
In the footage, it can be heard that Milly vulgarly abuses.
On the next video, it is heard that Holland's monkey offers cocaine and says " I want cocaine. "
She licked his fingers..
In May, together with his partner Russell Cox (43), he admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her home, she was found with 1600 pounds of cocaine hidden in Kinder Eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.

As for standing in front of the machine, the note that one doesn't need any of this at all was taken quite seriously., because it is not needed at all.
In addition, they are slowly moving into the era when ignorance is a sign of punk.

If reporters were able to calculate, it is possible that the covid never reached these proportions.
The wedding on the first sight continues. the war between Kadriho and Andrey continues.
This is the main reason why it is not possible for Switzerland to leave at once,, replied Andrea on Instagram in her stories to the inquisitive fans who were disappointed with her performance at Kadirim and decided to cut off all contact and even block her on social media.
Between Kadrim and Andreou there was friction from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that, at least until he returns to Croatia permanently,, his wife Andrea would stay with him.
However, she resolutely rejected it.
And as seen, their relationship did not only end in love but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred..
This was a planned attack by Kadri in response to Andreino's accusation of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadriho's apparent honesty was not liked by even his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
Normally, they don't talk about such things and in the family they never talked about them much.
He does not want to provoke any sympathy.
But when she sees someone who is trying to publicly disgrace and tarnish the name of someone who she loves so much, she can't tolerate it.
It's a pity that she had to go this way, but she wanted to publicly thank her brother Kadrimu for the fact that he made himself into a character and helped his family when they needed it the most, in spite of his young age.
I'm more disappointed when he has to read such misleading information,, which is likely to have been taken out of context.
Hrozně bych all wanted to know Kadriho the way he was known by his friends, relatives and family, in reaction to the words of Andrey.
I'm really grateful to him.
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that he, his family love him and know the truth and know what really happened..
The drunken thief climbed up the façade to the fifth floor.
It's hard to believe that it is because of this..
Cchao began his robbery raid on the parking grounds in the residential quarters, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, from one vehicle, it was stolen for approximately 330 crowns.
He then climbed to the fifth floor and jumped through an open window into the apartment.
Tam stole two bananas.
On one of the security cameras, he can be seen walking away from the scene of the crime, eating a banana at the same time..
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning and discovered that the bananas were not where they were,, he called the police.
Then Cchaa was detained.
The man confessed that he drank alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, in a state of drunkenness, he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk man climbed up the façade to the fifth floor, stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time limited and dependent on pandemic readiness.

I think that all of the things that the people here write are well known..
He plays the role of a fool in order to have someone to fight with.
If not, it is sad.
I don't believe that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
And even from an aesthetic point of view, he likes a lot of church buildings.
It doesn't matter to me who believes in what.
On the other hand, he dislikes the fact that the church had a lot of power in the Middle Ages, that it made a lot of money, that it suppressed science and other things.
Unrelated to all wars, for example, the 30- year war.
It is possible to believe in the spaghetti monster,, but the state and the church have nothing to do with each other.

There are greater fears than of the coronavirus about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities.

At first glance, it is not complicated.
The vast majority of substantive names in Czech represent only one grammatical gender, and it is not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neutral.
On the other hand, there is also a relatively large group of substantive names where the gender is not fixed..
Substantive names oscillate between two genera.
When pronounced, they acquire double consonants and in some cases remain in the unstressed form.
For example, the words " swivel " and " kyxel " are both masculine and feminine, in the first case the pronunciation is based on the model " machine " and in the second on the model " song.
The other group of substantives have different forms in the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of
Both forms are official and have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some words may vary regionally,, for example, " okurka " in Čechia and " okurek " in Moravia, in this case, the Moravian variant is not written. Similarly, other Czech- Moravian pairs of words, " prikop " and " prikopa " and " kobliha " and " koblih " are not written.
Some words, which have entered the Czech language from other languages, were originally unaccented,, but have gradually acquired Czech endings.
A typical example is the word " image " which is both masculine and feminine, or the word " buffet " which has remained in the middle gender and has endings that resemble " castle ".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to enter Europe.
The situation directly on the Greek border.
At the Greek- Turkish border there is tension due to the increasing number of migrants who are trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to leave the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending it.
European politicians promise to help Greece, humanitarian aid is also being prepared by the Czech government.
What actually motivates the refugees to embark on the uncertain journey.
And how the situation is directly on the spot.
For three months, they had not seen the blue sky and they were suffocated,, the journalist from Sydney describes.
The devastating fires that have plagued Australia for four months have killed nearly 300 people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
As the local authorities and the inhabitants themselves deal with the disaster.
The government of Prime Minister Morrison could have done more to prevent the drastic impacts that critics have claimed.
and what the earth will have to prepare for in relation to climate change in the future.
Lenka Kabrhelová talks with the journalist from Sydney, Ikou Detrichov.
False accusations have always been and are very rare.
Therefore, the word is always written everywhere.
For people, it is uncomfortable to talk about how sexual violence is prevalent in their society and how widespread it is,, so they try to downplay it.
He has not personally known anyone who was falsely accused.
He knows a lot of people who have been raped and he has witnessed how the people around them or the police often behave towards them.
The victims must always believe.
The trend has become that the victims finally open up about their traumas.
However, it is still the case that too many people keep it for themselves.
There are also those who falsely accuse others..
It's a disgusting act of violence against all victims of sexual assault, but the spreading of the idea that " a large part of the accusations are fabricated " and that it is a " trend " helps only sexually violent perpetrators.
Czechia is flooded with unfinished houses and families do not have enough money to complete them.
The prices of building materials have increased by more than 30 percent in the last few weeks and months.
A number of people were in a difficult situation because of this.
It does not have the funds to complete the unfinished family houses and the banks have refused to increase the hypothecial loans.
In addition to the increase in the cost of materials, there is also an increase in the cost of construction work.
As a result, people do not have enough money to complete the unfinished family homes.
In many cases, the banks refuse to increase the hypothecial loan, which creates extremely uncomfortable situations.
In the better case, people move into unfinished and unlicensed houses.
In the worst case, the houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay off the hypotecas and to pay rent as well.
They build two to three family houses a year, and in 50 percent of the cases, they succeed.
For the construction company, it is difficult because they have to comply with certain things in the contract, even though the material has become more expensive.
As a result, the company has no profit. " said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are only just starting to have financial problems.
If they had anticipated that it would cost five million to build the house, now it will cost seven million.
Some will be disappointed, said Slivoň..
The most expensive material was copper, iron and also the equipment used by blacksmiths and coppersmiths.
Construction firms also struggle with a lack of workers.
In Czech there is a shortage of graduates in the construction industry and the influx of foreign workers slows down the pandemic.
However, the situation is more favorable in terms of issuing building permits..
"The construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits in October, which is nearly 10 percent more than the previous year,, " Křeček clarified.
They are doing well and will be doing even better.
The real vision is lacking, according to the commentator of the Croatian Radio and Television.
The beginning of the new year was accompanied by traditional celebrations as well as the pronouncements of politicians.
In addition to Prime Minister Andreje Babiše and President Miloše Zemana, the nation was addressed by the President of the Senate and the President of the Chamber of Deputies.
The most important thing is that they have learned.
As in this, the diploma thesis is the best, it has its own theme, which he has chosen, continues the bachelor's thesis and always works on it for a year and then finishes it in two weeks with a written part.
In the United States, the situation is completely calm, as long as the person is not a total madman and still has something in his head. and the committee is not unnecessarily harassing him with theory.
For example, he spent a week preparing for the state exam and when he was in the finals, the committee always tried to persuade him to come up with a logical derivation, which he managed to do correctly.
In contrast to these projects, there are known people who pay someone to do the semester project ( they did it several times, it was very beneficial and they learned a lot ) and then only do the project and have nothing to do.
According to him, it is super when the end of the project is a test, in which the knowledge gained during the project is evaluated, not just the defense.
Everything is okay, they do not fail to respond to emails and telephone calls and do not send any packages to the embassy.
He's the same as them.
The people at the embassy have nothing in common with them.
If they were against Russia, they would have risked a lot, so they might have to play with them, because otherwise they would have been in danger.
It is possible to put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Pú.
For example, it should be translated so that Xi Jinping's butt would be grabbed. or something like that.
I agree, despite the fact that Insta kicks artists under their feet.
As soon as every day he does not publish stories and at least every second he publishes a new image, his reach decreases to a minimum.
In addition, Navic is constantly changing what is more important, whether it is a like, a comment or an upload.
I've been very disappointed with it in recent years, so he may have to reduce his presence on TikTok,, where many artists from his genre have achieved success and are reluctant to give up on it..
In the end, she would have been happy if something more user-friendly came out, one that does not extract all of the artist's creativity and energy.
The Proclamation of the Workers of Donbas
The Union - yes, against the breakup of the Soviet Union - and opponents of the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Thirty years after the illegal dissolution of the Soviet Union.
On December 8, 1991, the biggest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of humanity took place.
On 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevič, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the 17 March 1991 referendum, secretly and without regard to the people, signed an agreement that " the Soviet Union as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceased to exist.
One stroke of the pen " abolished " the huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
The disintegration of the Soviet Union resulted in tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens living abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the population of the former Soviet republics, they have already lost more people than in both World War I and World War II combined.
The same people who destroyed what had been built over the previous 70 years, betrayed the socialist camp ( created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War.
Vědomie deindustrialized the country, slowed down agriculture, detached the fourteen republics that were previously economically united in a single mechanism.
If one wants to look deeper, they see the depopulation of the population, the collapse of the economy, science and the armies, the rise in criminality, ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-- Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring and the war in Syria - all of which are the result of geopolitical capitulation, first to the socialist camp and then to the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as " power vacuum "
All that was left behind in a hurry was lost and abandoned, quickly filled and conquered by the territories of NATO that accepted the geopolitical capitulation of the Soviets..
The whole world is still shaken by events from the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of the product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and they have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 KC / kg.
I will buy it with the intention of keeping it in the refrigerator and making it into a meal on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which he does not buy meat on Monday, on Tuesday, the chain lowers the price to 99 Kč / kg - he describes the mechanism by which the meat's price changes and becomes a threat to his living system.
A or he could wait until Thursday, when the meat would be 1 day before its use was reduced to 69 Kč / kg, which would have made it 120 Kč more expensive than the meat he bought on Monday and left in his refrigerator for 3 days.
I answer for himself - nothing.
These kecs about the fact that when something is cheap, it must be bad, rotten or of poor quality are extremely retarded, as he says himself.
A few days ago, he went to Brno to Hlavas and in the underpass, the girls handed out some brochures similar to those he always takes with him to help the brigadiers, they cannot throw them away.
The pamphlet was full of peasant wisdom and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but there was no mention of God, and he was bewildered but suspected that it was some sort of propaganda.
After reading it, he found out who published it,, and eventually, from it came Scientology.
However, he was a good sailor, full of useless rules and regulations that he was supposed to obey and not to be a pirate.
It is a waste of paper, because of this, the forests would not have to be cut down.
He had a similar experience with his ex- girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional intimidation force this person to comply, even though he or she does not realize the extent to which he or she is being exploited.
Several times, she threatened to hurt him because he went out with a friend whom she disliked.
And when he wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she broke down and on her knees begged him not to leave.
Then he began to physically block the doors.
It was a great relationship for about a year,, but after another half year it began to fall apart.
After that, he ended the relationship by telling her that he was breaking up with her and lying to her by saying that they could still talk about it the following week to reassure her that he was not going to hurt her again.
A person like this sucks the life out of a city, emotionally and spiritually..
It is better to keep a distance.
When, in a frenzied manner, they plunder the hospitals by buying large quantities of tests and rushing to the positive, those who were not aware of the test and the disease.
The only thing they achieved was to complicate the work of companies, transport companies and others, because their employees were sentenced to five days of house arrest.
On the west side, they stopped with the shackling of the sick and acknowledged that it is not worth trying to cure a disease worse than the famous chickenpox.

After several years of stagnation and repression of this disgusting business, MLM recruitment is again on the rise.
He was one of the recruits, he tried to do it ( he was 20 years old and a first- year student at the university, the initial promises of professional training and business skills quickly turned into " it doesn't matter to them and they recruited a lot of people. "
He was genuinely interested in the products offered, because he wanted to help people, but the training was more about scaring and intimidating people.
When the first money was earned, the person quickly realized that in order to make money, he had to produce a number of certain products every month.
Investment life insurance and real estate were the only sources of income,, which made the person feel like a street hawker.
However, the experience was valuable, the person learned that he should not jump on every speck of dust and thoroughly investigate the information.
At the same time, he would not throw all of them into one basket.
There are people in this business who are successful, and even those who are beneficial,, but they do not brag about expensive consumer goods or " plump " accounts.
In the corporation where he works, he has not experienced such things.
HR is in a state of calm, the managers are busy with their managing and they don't stick their noses into anything.
There are regular evaluations, they take place in the form they do in the United States, and it works to a certain extent ( they set goals for the next year, at the end of the year they look at what has been achieved and what has not been achieved ) - it is more of a self- assessment than that of being judged by numbers, and similarly.
Corporate events are also not mandatory.
They are also somewhat unique within their own company in that they are more corporate.
Sometime, a person has the impression that they are a quasi- start-up that squats in the offices of a large corporation.
As long as the results are good, they don't bother them too much.
Czech missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days, the British police unsuccessfully searched for the missing 32- year old Czech woman who lost her way at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradištska had died.

Sincere sorrow, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The last time the young woman was seen alive was on 28 November in a bus on the way to work. before boarding the bus, she also picked up money from a bank machine.
Her disappearance was announced by her colleagues five days later..
After that, the London police began to investigate and Interpol placed her on the list of missing persons throughout the world.
It also appeared in the Czech missing persons database.
The police have already detained one man in connection with the case for several days..
In the case, Jakou played a major role and is suspected of having played a major role, but did not reveal it.

This is the biggest problem with the whole pandemic..
It took a while for him to adjust to the fact that he had contracted a highly contagious disease,, but it went smoothly.
It has been difficult for him to deal with the fact that a large part of the population on all its layers behaves in an idiotic way..
He is most looking forward to the vaccination ( scheduled for the next day ) because thanks to it, he will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not scumbags.
He was stripped of his presidency and his ability to regain it.
However, the chances of this actually happening are very small.
In addition,, he is not sure whether the fact that the files were declassified in the first place made it possible to consider them as evidence of high treason.
Velezrada is an act of the president of the republic that threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
The number of people under 35 years old who are without sex for a whole year has increased.
More and more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
The main focus is on the religiously inclined people,, as reported by the Daily Mail's web newspaper.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of people aged under 35 who had stopped having sex increased from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who stated that they had not had sexual intercourse in the last year were more than ever before.
The decline in the number of sexually active individuals is also influenced by other factors, revealed by a survey of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher percentage of unemployment.
The presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex for young people less of a priority, also contributed..
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they had no sex in the previous year has grown rapidly,, said researcher Lyman Stone of the IFS.
In married couples, sexual activity is more frequent, in 2021, only 5 % of them stated that they had not had sex in the previous year.
Among the free people, it was 29 % and Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also due to fear of premarital sex and religious affiliation.
However, there is a greater likelihood that married men are sexually active, and the percentage of married women under the age of 35 is still decreasing.
Young people's opinion on premarital sex is divided, about 30 % consider it to be a bad thing, while about 70 % believe that it is acceptable.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior pushes this trend forward. Stone says of the 30 percent.
For the majority of those who have moral problems with premarital sex, the reason is their religious upbringing.
Since 2008, the proportion of abstinence among people younger than 35 years old who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 percent to nearly 60 percent.
Among the " less believers " the trend rose from 10 to 20 percent, according to Stone.
The decline in sexual activity is also influenced by other factors,, such as less social interaction and especially social alcohol consumption during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of having sex is lower among people who are unemployed or have lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which may reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time on the internet, as a result of which this need is " substituted " by it.
This trend became popular during the lockdown during the pandemic of the coronavirus.
The whole issue of compulsory vaccination against the AIDs is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave in a way that they do not want,, but which may save their lives.
It is a relatively difficult question, on which he himself is most interested in the question of social responsibility.
For example, the question of whether, if they are not forbidden and they die, it is their fault.
His argument is that the 80--year old man, who did not know much about it, was misinformed and as a result did not want to be vaccinated and eventually contracted the disease and died.
On the other side, he does not think that he can be responsible for the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccinations, who, together with the SPD and the KSČ, promoted the idea of persecution and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics mentioned, it is possible to deduce that the vast majority of unvaccinated pensioners belong to the second group, which means that they are able to take care of themselves.
Czechia without snow.
As the mild winter affects the fight against drought.
The winter of 2012 in Croatia so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent years.
The operators of skiing areas are not able to operate without technical snow, and the weather complicates the preparation of the 100 km bicycle race in the Jizerka Mountains.
It is a trend, or an exception.
Lack of snow means little for the fight against drought in Czechia.
I have one story to tell, but it is not about a man who was beaten..
Once in the middle of the city, the teacher led them across the entire city to the boat dock, so that they could sail on the river in boats.
Along the way, they passed through one such fairly wide road and saw a group of followers of the Hare Krishna sect in the middle of the road..
Naturally, they were overwhelmed.
Fortunately, she managed to escape, but with one of her friends she had a conversation..
When she left, they asked her and the teacher what she said.
They asked him if he wanted to save his soul.
He told them that he has no soul, that he replied..
Everyone, including the teachers, were smiling all the way to the dock..
They are terribly spoiled.
It does not happen as much, but the system is crumbling, according to Orozović.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors.
"It opens a new chapter in the bilateral relations, " said Morawiecki at the joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The crisis caused by the unsettling movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border is, according to the Chancellor, to be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the " Normandy Group " consisting of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that the Chancellor informed him about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially created a migrant crisis and uses people as living targets and weapons, because every night there are hundreds of attempts to cross the border illegally.
With the Chancellor, he discussed further sanctions to force the Lukašenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin to realise that they are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz told the DPA that Warsaw enjoys German support in its dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukašenko regime.
The intoxicated Polish nun caused the accident and tried to conceal it.
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but it was driven by another nun,, who tried to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could lose her driver's license for not giving way and fleeing the scene of a traffic accident, she came out with the truth, said TVN24 station.
She admitted that she collided with another nun, who asked her for help.
The police then came for Celestine's sister.
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and after discovering that she had more than two promiles of alcohol in her blood, immediately stripped her of her driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would be questioned in court about her actions.
Pes Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmović did not protect his film.
The Czech creators of family comedies have been seen in American stories about pet lovers.
However, they overlooked a crucial aspect of filmmaking, the conventions of the film industry.
After the kitsch film F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people to live, another film is now competing for the audience's emotions in cinemas.
Co--author of the screenplay and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr. freely continues on his previous film Tady hlidam ja from 2012.
The speaking fox Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the stage..
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumavian pension, which is going bankrupt, and so they hire a dog trainer, Julie's father with his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl but a young woman who is experiencing her first love..
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičov, who is also the producer of the film, struggled with the pace of the storytelling in the previous film, which appealed to children and dogs.
This time, the creative duo wrote a weaker script that provokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
To summarize it.
Julie, a scientist, falls under the spell of the desire to have a child and, when the right " constellation " is achieved, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are precisely determined - on the roofs of cars or church towers ( in the course of an ongoing excursion with a local guide, the retired colonel Mojmír, despite his long--standing training, is shot in the forest and his daughter ( Julie ) falls into a coma, after which the family is removed from the hospital to allow the miraculous process of healing to take place in the heart of the Šumavian wilderness.
There is no objection to the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of the animals' beloved ones.
Their owners know why they have them.
The audience, however, was stunned by the absurdity of the plot, the lack of credibility of the characters and situations.
A couple of thieves from the staff, the competition of dog trainers and the shumavian sharlatan, the policemen arriving to investigate " drugs " and discussing the strength of bone powder as a fertilizer, and the peeled- off family in the pension drinking alcohol.
When the hero comes out of a coma, he immediately sits at a cigarette- smoking, cigar- smoking, cigar - smoking, cigar – smoking, cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking
The audience is still told by the creators that " sometimes after a coma, it becomes. "
Šajmović's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build up dramatic situations, a sense of character and a sense of point and direction.
The acting is unbalanced and the editing is sloppy and the overall impression is sloppy.
Whatever Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudovo try to keep their party alive, they have little to play.
The only legacy of the film is the poetic scenes of the Šumavian landscape filmed by cameraman Vladimír Holomka and the pair of foxes.
It is not enough to sketch out a few characters, a flimsy plot and vulgar phrases, which the characters use.
The argument is not the fact that she has been a member of the Club of Hedgehog Breeders for a long time, as in the case of the producer.
For the purpose of propagating nature and friendship between man and dog, there must also be a knowledge of the craft, in order for the man to be able to tell a believable story.
In this case, it did not succeed.
The good family film has a little too much erotica and a little too little sensitivity for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canisterapy, this amateurish piece would not have passed..
However, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from the same kind of people as themselves.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, which can be seen in the way he understands it,, but this is only because he has never tried it.
The decision is always in the hands of the customer, and if he does not want to, the answer is always no.
If he listened to it for a long time,, he may have changed his opinion.
It is work like any other, in some cases a brigade.
The Balkans are experiencing unusually dry months.
The only time of the year when it rains is winter.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as observed at some stations, is unusual, as confirmed by the Israeli Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long--term rainfall average for November.
The two days of rain in this week were rather exceptional.
It is good for them.
It rained for a long time..
It is also the right Christmas backdrop for the residents of Nazareth, Wasím Aškar..
Rains in Israel occur almost exclusively in the winter months, are sporadic and irregular.
In the winter rains, the forests are dependent.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fire.
It is not only about forests, also about water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Galilee River, reached its maximum capacity in 2013 due to three consecutive rainy winters.
Since then, the water level has fallen.
The hydraulic engineers had warned of the drought for a long time.
"It is possible that rainfall will decrease as a result of global warming and climate change, " said in 2018 the spokesperson of the Israeli Ministry of Water Resources, Uri Schor.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination and recycling of waste water.
The situation is worse in economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan..
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman,, there is an increase in cistern vehicles.
Waters and private wells are drying up.
In September 2009, driver of the cistern vehicle Imad Sulejman said that the number of orders had increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years.
In the Iranian city of Isfahan, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The banks of the local rivers were completely without water.
The region has experienced the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military attack against Iran.
The Israeli Minister of Defense said that the talks in Vienna did not bring " any progress " and that he informed Washington of plans to attack Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran,, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, tries to persuade Americans to increase their pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about the military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring " any progress " and the world powers " understood that the Iranians were playing with them.
Around 3 years ago, this also happened to him.
She was a little annoying and grilled him during the conversation to find out what he wanted from him.
In the end, he discovered that his suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because he really dislikes this kind of people, he was harassing her with doubts and questions for a while, and eventually apologized and left..
I can say that he is a robber, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
The skiers went to the mountains for the weekend and were met with plenty of snow and good weather.
The ski resorts in Czechia experienced the first major influx of skiing enthusiasts during this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some skiing areas started operations as a result..
The truckers were not deterred by the obligation to show their covid certificates..
On the other hand, crane operators do not complain about the lack of interest from passengers, while some of the skiing equipment rental services report a lower demand for their services than before the epidemic..
Thousands of people took to the track and ski slopes in the region over the weekend..
The skiers enjoyed the weather, which provided sunshine and good snow conditions.
They are satisfied with the opening weekend, which began with evening skiing on Friday, when the first skiers arrived on the mountain., said Jakub Hanuš, director of the Sporting Area of Ještěd.
Hundreds of people went to the first weekend of skiing in the new season in the Jeseník mountains..
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov and the centre in Branna in Šumperska were open.
The weekend attendance was very good and on Saturday and Sunday, approximately 400 people attended.
Conditions are superb.
Today, the sun shined, the temperature was around minus three degrees, so it was perfect, the representative of the skiing centre in Branne, Rostislav Prochaszky praised.
The operators of ski areas can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are in the recovery period after contracting the disease.
except for exceptions, people are prepared and show the necessary documents, he said to ČTK by René Hroneš from the Skicenter of Špindlerův Mlýn.
"There were only a few incidents, " he added.
Lower demand than before the pandemic is reported by some skiing equipment rental shops and stores.
Interest in borrowing skiing equipment is high..
It is not like in the previous years,, but the number of customers is still high,, said Alexandra Bokișov from the Skiopava shop in Oradea..
There is a larger influx of people during the skiing course period..
Also, the director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, David Šintak, feels that there is not as much interest in renting skiing equipment due to the coronavirus.
At that time before the pandemic, they were already almost exhausted.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, they are at about 50 percent, said Šintak to ČTK.
According to him, people during the pandemic became lazy and learned to stay at home.
On the other hand, there is a great demand at the Novako camp in Bošimdara..
They started renting skiing equipment there a week ago, and those who want to rent them now have to order them in advance.
"Bicycles begin to be rented this weekend, but people called ahead of time, so the demand is expected to be high, just like last year. " said the manager of the area, Pavlina Novakova.
The interest is comparable to the period before the epidemic,, she says, also about the skiing school.
In order for successful and wealthy people to stay in the country, they must be able to live a quality life as in the country.
This does not include the socialist health system, where it is not always possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
The most intelligent and skilled people leave the country. they have no property in the country.
The owner of the company does not leave the country for a long time..
and the rest of it is absolutely true.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if they do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will not live in the Czech Republic..
The emigration from Romania began with one beautiful day when Orbán won and ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that, from one day to the next, the Czech Republic could find itself in a similar position.
The next issue is the elections.
When a fool lives there, it is possible for a traditional V4kovian madman to win.
The young and the educated leave, staying are the supporters and those whose property is loaded onto the aircraft..
A terrifying photo.
Langmajer in the blood for the sake of a beer.
While in Czech, the autumn was in full swing, in Thailand, the crew of the film Ostrov, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather.
The actor posted photos of his bruised face on social media.
It is a genuine injury or a fake one for the sake of filming.
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
The last time she was seen was on the way home.
The disappearance of Petry is not similar to her behaviour and the police are starting to worry about her., said Lucy O'Connor from the Lambeth police station where Srncová worked on Saturday in a video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also worried about her, and simply wants to know where she is. " continued.
The missing Czech, according to her, left work on Sunday 28th November around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
The last time she was seen was apparently in an autobus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on 3 December..
According to British media, Srncová worked as an assistant nurse at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy 's and St. Thomas 's NHS Foundation.
"They have great fears about their colleague Petru, who is missing,. " the group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
"They wanted to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help, to contact the police..
The public is also invited to cooperate by the Member of Parliament Harriet Harman,, who on Saturday highlighted the case of Srncov during a press conference.
She has been missing for several days now, she is only 32 years old, her parents have died of starvation, she is from the Czech Republic, and in her hand she held a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I have the feeling that all of them have a great responsibility to try to find her, because she was away from her native country, far from her family and was working there for the country's health care system. "
The police had already detained one man in connection with the case. he remains in custody.
According to the BBC's news website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what he was suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG ( i.e. about 5 divisions).
And I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
It is not " an overwhelming number " but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
It is noticeable that Ukraine constantly repeats that the threat of invasion is exaggerated and that it begins to have reservations about the country's entry.
He was at the top.
He doesn't know how he came to the conclusion that Russia wants war.
War is sakra expensive and Russia has the HDP of Italy.
Compared to the situation in 1938, it is in so many respects different that it is hard to know where to start..
He can compare it to the First Punic War and the " annexation " of Sicily.
It is hard to imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia annexed these small republics.
That is all and this " concentration " at the borders corresponds to it.
And the pacts are to be kept.
From Sunday, new schedules are in effect in Prague, affecting mainly suburban routes.
Passengers in the integrated public transport system of Prague (PID) will face several changes from Sunday, which mainly affect suburban routes.
New lines were created, some changed their routes and others were discontinued.
The Mladoboleslavsko district is now part of the integrated system..
In the main city, trains from Česki Budejovic stop in the Zahradni Město station from Sunday onwards..
In the suburban railway traffic, the S7 trains, travelling from Beroun to Český Brodu, pass through the main railway stations in Prague.
In the recently opened station of Zahradni Město, the rychlík R17 from Českých Budějovic and Benešov will now stop.
PID is now expanding to other areas.
The buses also went as far as Světle nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Starých Splavs and Turnov.
Included are buses in the Mladoboleslavska region, including those with overlapping routes to the Liberecky and Královéhradecky regions.
During the integration, 77 lines were cancelled, 37 new ones were introduced and 12 existing ones were altered.
From the Zličina district of Prague, a new bus line 405 is launched, which goes all the way to Žatce.
Also, a new direct road connection was established between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovnia, which replaced the cancelled railway line S53.
In the morning peak and on weekends, flights from Prague to Rakovnia will be strengthened, with the introduction of a new express line number 404.
The lines 400 and 410, operating in the Libereck region, are now included in the PID system.
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
Line 400 travels through Mělník, Dubou and Českou Lípa to Nového Boru and selected flights continue to Rumburak or Cvikova.
Line 410 runs from Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoně and Jablonné in Podještěd.
On the other hand, operation has been cancelled or reduced on 10 local railways in Central Bohemia, including to Mochova, Dobříše and Rožmitál pod Třemšin..
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railways, there are long--term restrictions on the tracks between Prague and Beroun, between Prague and Lysa nad Labem and in the area around Kolina.
Changes are also taking place for travellers at other locations..
The buses replace some of the discontinued railway lines or expand the section of line 420 from Dobrise with a connection to Prague, where PID tickets can be used as far as Milevska.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk were changed and the routes of some buses on the border between Central Bohemia and Horovica were altered in the Pilsen region.
A healthy lunch or dinner in the office from a supermarket.
Ahoy, he works from 9 to 5 with a 30- minute break and his only opportunity to get food is to go to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Due to the fact that he has no movement, after work he does not have the strength to exercise, so he has to eat as healthily and dietarily as possible.
Unfortunately, he doesn't know what he is going to buy, and in a hurry, he buys mainly pizza, bread and cheese, for snacks, yoghurt and apples..
The question is what a healthy meal, without the need for thermal processing, would have been recommended to be bought in the supermarket.
Not everyone wait for a meter of snow as they do, but unfortunately, this is not the case..
It's not about the trees that must be seen.
Under the snow, only the tip of a tree can hide.
If a tree is damaged, it may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I do not believe that this is the only reason for them to ban them from travelling outside the ski slopes,, but it is one of them.
Confession of Dary's relationship with Nedvěde
The Czech showbiz pond has nothing other than the exposure of the relationship between Dary Rolins and Pavla Nedvěda from Friday.
They have been together since the summer,, and the famous football player even broke up with her because of the singer.
Dara now sent a lengthy message to her fans, explained why she hid her love for him for half a year.
Dara is allowed to say that there is no one in Czechia or Slovakia who is not aware of the fact that Dara fell in love with the most successful Czech football player up to his ears..
But he took her away from him, not the other way around.
Three days are the focus of attention, and although they are popular with the public, they are not a source of joy.
It's here.
As for the two things that they both disliked, but knew that they would eventually come to,, the singer continues..
I don't know who is worse off.
Those who do not care about it at all, and it appears on them even from cans,, or those whose lives are dissected to the last detail..
As if someone wanted to hear the opinion on whether he or she fits well with his or her husband or his or her girlfriend, or that he or she was insistent on everyone knowing the list of his or her ex- partners and the list of his or her mistakes and failures.
This is the right way, it is what he wants, and it annoys Dare.
The duo met in Italy, where Rolins was preparing for the launch of her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been vice president of football club Juventus for a long time..
The truth came out only now, because they waited for the end of Nedvěd's divorce.
With his wife Ivan, they have been separated for three years, they are not legally married, but they have been together for three weeks.
Those who rejoice with them and wish them to succeed are to be thanked.
They are just people, they have families, children, pasts and dreams.
They are not perfect, but they both have their hearts in the right place.
Therefore, she loves her new husband as much as he loves her, and she stands by him in both good and bad times. Rolins concluded..
Ahoy, the other commentators have already said most of the important things, only confirming that the dorms are great at the beginning of the first semester or second semester, when most of the students meet and become roommates, which is the best option because they know who they will live with.
Most apartments are not advertised for a long time beforehand,, so now there is not much to be found, but looking at the offerings is not a waste of time.
Certainly, he avoids not only Cejlu,, but also the surrounding areas ( streets like Vranovska and Francouzska, and some parts of Židenic are very bad addresses.
On the other hand, the quarter of Veveří is full of students, Královo pole and in that direction is good, except that it is close to most of the faculties of VUT..
However, he has never been a landlord,, but he is a native of Brno,, so he may be able to give advice about Brno as such, if he still has some missing information..
This is an example of completely normal thinking.
Because of the decision of some doctors somewhere in Poland,, it is actually perfectly normal that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
If they choose to study what they want and pay for it themselves, or if they follow state guidelines and pay for it with state money.
It is not possible to allow a private actor to take over a part of the school system only because it receives a full state subsidy and is able to teach whatever it wants in the schools..
This statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier expressed himself in the same way about a boycott of a totalitarian state.
It's the same for him as for those who oppose having a statue on the square..
By talking directly with the person who assigned the work to him.
During the cataloging and digitalization process, he has already experienced that ( and also long--term professionals ) that they either have a distorted view of the eye or that they write something in the form of XXX or XX ( according to convention ) and put it in the notes that it is unreadable.
It is true that, in this case, it is quite legible,, so that it would be better not to recommend it.
Personally, he would have dealt with it in a note according to the program he used.
If he wanted to be a good and diligent student, he could look into some phonological databases and find the nearest.
However, because it looks as if it is based on some books, it is likely that the author or printer simply created his own personal symbol, which fits with what is physically on the coin.
PS. It is not a coincidence but rather the Odrynian Empire ( kingdom ) rather than the Odrynian Kingdom.
PSS says that someone has already broken it down here.
Looking at this comment with Φίlh.
Politicians do not know what the " theme " of Romania's presidency will be.
This is much worse than the fact that they will have translators with them.
The idea that something was approved because no one understood a text is amusing.
All important documents are scrutinized word for word, yet some basic knowledge of English is insufficient, this is the domain of lawyers.
In various institutions of the EU, hundreds of translators and interpreters work, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts and the establishment of exceptional relationships.
In addition, with the English, it is quite interesting after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
He can't understand the hatred on Cejl..
He has been working there for the third year and is in a good mood.
He goes home from work at 10 p.m. and never has a problem.
To that is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has lived there for a long time..
Jo lives there with most of the Roma population of Brno, but the only thing they do is block the pavement and park where they are not supposed to. It is not the case that he would be afraid to go out on the street in the evening.
In other words, if he was looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, he would have gone for it.
There are a lot of apartments there now, newly reconstructed or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78 years old without Dada and girlfriend Gelemova as a cog in the wheel.
With whom he spends the holidays.
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
He does not have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to burn.
Blesku's saxophonist said that he has seen Dada's wreath and that Lucie probably has one as well,, confirming Patrasova's words that she often visits him.
She visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrade,, where Dada stayed alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he would be on Christmas Eve.
Recently, they met with Anička, Felix and the two grandchildren.
Video : Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová - Zase Spolu.
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová, Zase Spolu.
However, they continued to talk about something, so they didn't break up on Christmas.
I don't know where he is.
Gifts are bought on a regular basis and Dad and Lucia are likely to buy something, probably a perfume.
He is a gentleman, Felix added, who himself came to the premiere of the music video in the club Richman.
He is alone, but he does not feel alone.
He always finds someone with whom he likes to have fun,, according to Slováček, who was glad that he met his wife Luďka Soboty Adrian and singer Kamila Nyvlt.
He made it clear.
And they are the Island, so they can allow themselves not to have soldiers and weapons.
They doubt that anyone would defend them and that their location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot to not occupy it.
I don't understand why it would be a bad argument, he would have to explain it to him.
There is no other component that could be used in the crisis in the hospitals..
Policemen are scarce and cannot afford to do so, so only the firefighters and nowhere else have such a high percentage of healthily trained people at such a level.
That the army is capable of defending Ostrava goes against the previous governments, not the army,, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record low rainfall in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside is not just a factory for food, said the journalist.
Czechia is experiencing the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the amount of water has decreased in mountainous and sub--mountainous areas, the amount of rainfall has also decreased in areas where there was not a lack of water.
The cause of the drought in a large part of central Europe is climate change.
The effects are amplified by the manner in which the land is cultivated.
On what to prepare for in relation to the drought.
and how nature can help in difficult times.
Jo is going to be like that, he is able to stay on the ice in ice hockey, he knows how to play the game and the tactics ( which he tried in the video game Franchise Hockey Manager ) are also haluz.
If a team is called the "Russian Bears" or the " Chinese Lions " it will lose by two goals even if it does not try to win the match. This is different from when it is compared.
In the same way, what the commentators listen to, what the referees notice or do not notice, in men's or women's hockey, is all strange, but it is the same with all sports, UEFA and " Italian actors " or motorsport F1, WRC, atd.
Controversy is everywhere.
If it was the other way around, it would be as it usually is, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than they have won,, so that it would be a typical "they lost " vs " they won ".
Coronavirus - The number of cases in Russia exceeded 10 million.
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
There are 5,766 persons hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in Croatia and another 74.

The United Kingdom is facing " inevitable " large waves of infection caused by the Omikron, said Dr. Susan Hopkinsová, the chief medical adviser to the British Office of Health and Safety on Sunday in television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with the omikron strain are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their numbers to increase.
So far, no one has died of the omikron strain, but hospitalization occurs approximately 14 days after infection and death occurs approximately three weeks after infection.
The head of the British Labour Party, Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson probably violated the law by organizing a New Year's quiz in Downing Street in December 2010, when the lockdown was imposed and New Year's parties were banned.
One of Johnson's ministers defended that the quiz was held " virtually " over a computer.
However, it was attended by a group of Downing Street staff gathered around computers.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the post of prime minister is growing.
During December 2010, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties in defiance of the lockdown.
The British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government have made a mockery of them.
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV for Britain, said that two years ago, Boris Johnson won the general election with an overwhelming majority.
In the morning, the Conservative Party spoke of the need to remove him from the position of prime minister.
Noteworthy, how quickly events unfolded.
They want to turn around and save their skin.
Romania is waiting for elections in the spring, which could end the 12- year reign of Victor Orban.
The elections are of great importance for the whole of Europe.
As time goes on, it becomes clear that they are good people.
They are not fair.
They are unlikely to be free, because they were not free even in the last two elections under Orban.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of election districts to benefit from this, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
The current situation is that each person can choose where they want to live.
This allows Fidesu to attract voters from certain districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could win.
In other words, there will be no ferries at all.
They think that it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018.
The situation is very different.
Previously, it was about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now, there is a real possibility that the united opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
For Viktor Orbán and his party, this is an unprecedented phenomenon.
They will not be able to maintain their power by playing even more aggressively.
There are some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they had done before.
Recently, a recording of the president of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fideszu, Lászloa Kövera, was leaked to the independent media, in which the chiefs of the secret services declare that the opposition is a threat to national security.
These are the hints of a new approach that are discussed.
This is one of the new things.
Everything begins with language.
She was beaten quite often, the last time was when she was 14, her mother is not very tolerant, she herself is not very tolerant, and her father has been beating her for a long time,, but then he broke down ( only in relation to her ). .
At the same time, she was very choleric and she was very angry as a child, to the extent that she lay on the ground in convulsions and was all blue, twice she was taken under the sprinkler to calm down.
He was sometimes punished, sometimes he did not know what he was doing.
In the meantime, she has a tendency to resolve things violently,, as a child she was quite rebellious,, and as a young girl she used to hit her parents ( so that she wouldn't get too much of a beating ) , and as a young girl she used to hit her parents ( so that she wouldn't get too much of a beating ) , and as a young girl she used to hit her parents ( so that she wouldn't get too much of a beating ) , and as a young girl she used to hit her parents ( so that she wouldn 't get too much of a beating ) , and as a young girl she used to hit her parents ( so that she wouldn 't get too much of a beating ) , and as a young girl she used to hit her parents ( so that she wouldn 't get too much of a beating ) , and as a young girl she used to hit her parents ( so that she wouldn 't get too much of a beating ) , and as a young girl she used to hit her parents ( so that she wouldn 't get too much of a beating ) , and as a young girl she used to hit her parents (
She is not able to determine to what extent her explosiveness is due to her upbringing, but it certainly has a part in it.
He is afraid that he will also lose his patience with his children and deal with it in the same way.
He thinks that beating children is bad and that his parents did not have to do it, especially in this moment when it was not " educational " but out of frustration. On the other hand, almost every parent damages their children in some way, so he does not blame them.
It doesn't bother him and he does not understand why the OP should be ashamed.
The laws must be clear and unambiguous.
Kundami would therefore call those who create laws in such a quality.
It would be interesting to see whether they are afraid of a drop in income.
It is possible to count on the fact that people want and buy these products, that they will be able to pay for the debt.
Kocner's bizarre world.
When Slovakia moves the process of the murder of the journalist Kuciaka.
In Slovakia, the main trial in the case of the four accused of murdering Jana Kuciaka and Martina Kushnirov began..
The death of an investigative journalist and his partner changed Slovakia.
The civil society was shaken, but it also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Mariana Kočner and his connection to the top of Slovakian politics and justice.
The significance of this breakthrough for Slovakia.
For this, the journalists are responsible..
It is possible that this petition received more media attention than the counter- petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later.
It's not as bad as it was before,, but it is still bad. The society has turned its back on them..
In the Czech television, people died of the disease even before half a year..
The next government is dissolved and the law on the involvement of villages in the selection of the disposal site is nowhere.
Minister Karla Havlíčka's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiše is nearing its end and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of villages and their inhabitants in the selection and approval of a deep underground repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the examination of the proposal presented by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce after years of pressure.
However, its content is in serious disagreement not only with the affected communities united in the Platform against underground nuclear waste facilities,, but also with the Association of Cities and Towns of Romania.
The local authorities expect a more significant strengthening of their ability to decide on the disposal of radioactive waste,, as promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which requires the implementation of the nuclear law and the European directive.
They expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposed law by Minister Karla Havlíčka, which the Platform has at its disposal, is criticized by the communes in particular. The proposed level of involvement of the communes and the public in the process of deciding on the location of the disposal facility is inadequate and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the communes and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective when the local authorities or the public can influence whether or not the process is continued in that locality.
It is possible to ensure the placement of the responsibility of the Waste Disposal Authority to ask for the consent of the affected communities before the commencement of the specific proceeding..
The draft proposal is almost completely oblivious to the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the communes little more than statistics in the permitting process.
In the draft, there is a lack of systematic compensation for the villages for the entire process of searching for and choosing the site for the disposal facility, its approval and operation.
The representatives of the villages, according to today's legal norms, have little possibility to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place for the disposal facility.
Only in certain licensing procedures, they can submit their objections or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or minister in whose interest the licence is issued.
A possible lawsuit does not have an immediate effect on the execution of surveying or construction work.
The Platform's proposal for a joint decision by the self---government is a principle that is commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and is decided upon in those that have already progressed in the construction of waste disposal facilities,, such as in Sweden and Finland.
The preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the Havel and Partners advokate company, which was signed by SÚrao and followed by contracts with the advokate Jan Zemánek.
The total cost of these works according to the contract is approximately 4 million krones.
Antonin Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson of the Platform against deep underground nuclear waste disposal said that after the ministers of the Ministry of Industry, who only rebuffed the position of the local authorities in the search for a deep underground nuclear waste disposal facility,, the new government is waiting for a more decisive turnaround.
They also offer assistance.
It also received support from the Association of Municipalities and Towns, which considers the issue of inadequate rights of municipalities in relation to major construction projects to be similar to those of directly affected municipalities in the chosen localities.
The Platform against underground nuclear waste disposal unites 51 members ( 35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations ) for the purpose of promoting changes in the state's approach to the handling of decommissioned nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which is not limited to the underground nuclear waste disposal facility.
The Platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of the location for the possible disposal was dependent on the prior approval of the affected communities.
Herce Johna Goodman (69 years old) lost 90 kilograms..
Although his lifestyle has remained unchanged for a long time, eventually he was frightened by the doctors..
They told him that if he did not lose weight, he would die.
It took a long time.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, this is half of his original weight of 180 kilograms, reported the newspaper The Sun.
At the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles,, he introduced his new character.
From the sitcom Roseanne, he is a completely different person.
John joked that his friends and family urged him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture to break.
"All of it went into his mouth, " the actor said in an interview with AARP in 2018.

Moving, exercising.

It also depends on which boss and how the word " boss " is used.
If it is a text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment,, in general,, he would not translate it.
If it was a formal text or a high school text,, he would have looked for how the bosses were more likely to describe or explain.
There are many different types of bosses..
For example, a game like Dark Souls has several bosses, that is, the " boss " is something like the lord or ruler of the level, and then there is a final boss.
In many games, there are hidden bosses ( super bosses ) that are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often stronger than standard bosses.
These include games such as Half Life, where the bosses are present, but the player does not fight them directly ( Tentacle and Gargantua ) and can be called in any way.
And then there are mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss in one word in any language. even the Catalan language, which translates the boss as the final enemy.
It is important for the story or the game in general for the computer- controlled opponent to be stronger than all the previous ones and to guard the completion of a certain level or task.

It is believed to have come from Uherskohradišťska.
Pete worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.

Before Christmas, Czech terrorizes Agent Tesla.
On the other hand, data from October showed a slight decline in the number of attack campaigns, but the month prior to the end of the year saw an increase in the number of attacks.
On 18 November, there was a large campaign in connection with Agent Tesla.
The attacks are aimed at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for the time being.
The infected envelope in the e--mail has attracted the attention of the user because of the name, which refers to payments and financial transactions.
In contrast to the previous month, the dangerously named add-on had the word faktura in its name, this time it was designated as Kopie oprav účtenyes for 11,2021. Martin Jirkal of Eset said.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The harmful code actively searches for stored registration codes and then transmits them to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in Czechia at the end of August and the beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers rose again.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case did not specifically target the Czech Republic and security specialists in November detected more of a global campaign.
Compared to the November data of the Formbook, in November, it slightly decreased, but still accounted for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th and 15th of November.
Formbook contained the most common attachment with the suffix .exe, which carried the name Request for Specification.
However, the name of the ticket is also used..
The accompanying material may be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
The security analysts noted a significant drop in activity in the Fareit program, which accounted for 16 percent of attacks and had no major campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.

It is difficult to say what movement would come out of this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the influx of money, but also on whether the quadruple and more Pfizer vaccine becomes a square.

He is very happy that the vaccine saved him.

The Bulgarian president Rumen Radev entrusted the formation of new governments to the leader of the anti- corruption movement Pokrauchen, Kiril Petkov, who won the November elections.
This has been achieved with the formation of a broad coalition government, which is expected to take office within a few days.

The victorious parties were unable to come to an agreement, so there were two early elections.
