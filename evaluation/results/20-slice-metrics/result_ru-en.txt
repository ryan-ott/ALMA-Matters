Among the model's features are the use of breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for air permeability, is well ventilated naturally, like coir from the coconut.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate is maintained in the sleeping places.
Also, the mattress has an extended warranty period.
The official guarantee period from the manufacturer is 5 years, the actual lifespan of the mattress is longer.
The protection from dust and pollution is assigned to the removable jacket made of jaccarde, delivered in a set.
Purchasing a pair of orthopedic mattress with a cushion – it is recommended for maintaining the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the function of the two sides – the coconut serves as an anatomical support for the spine and the latex relaxes muscles.

Germany - the fourth vaccination from the coronavirus is unavoidable.
The fourth vaccination is required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the opinion of the expert, the current vaccination in Germany is not final and continues with new strength.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of vaccine against the coronavirus are unlikely to be sufficient for full protection.
In this assured leader of the Association of general practitioners, Ulrich Vaigelldt.
On the 11th of December, Die Welt reported on this.
"The fourth vaccination is expected to be necessary in the summer, the latest in the autumn, according to the expert.
In addition to this, Vaigelldt expects that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus could be carried out " in conjunction with the flu vaccination.
This helps to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus " Omicron ".
In particular, the new variant is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with the " Omicron " strain is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of the preliminary research conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the producers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to deliver the vaccine adapted to the Omikron in March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against the new variant of the coronavirus " Omicron ".
The research of BioNTech and Pfizer showed that the effectiveness of the two doses of the vaccine is significantly lower: "neutralizing potential decreases more than 25 times.
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omikron strain - as indicated by BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger advocates the reduction of the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, the accelerated vaccination process has an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omikron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel is very convincing in this regard, - the expert emphasized.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet- A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm and 8.5 grams.
The Bet- A Vib series is a special branch of the Bet- A family from the company Pontoon 21.
She ( as well as the series Kalikana Vib ) differs from many other fishes in that she was originally created for underwater fishing, and not just for fishing in pairs.
These insects have a greater weight than their similar- sized counterparts, which, undoubtedly, has a positive impact on the use of these interesting bait.
The other noticeable feature is the upper plastic plate, made of hard and resilient plastic, which creates additional vibrations during vertical and horizontal movements.
As a " winter worm " when fishing with the Bet- A Vib, it demonstrates a very aggressive game.
Often, the most captivating animation is the simple, monotonous movement, i.e. movement up and down almost without pauses.
Planning for a deviation from the vertical axis that is not very great, which is convenient for fishing in confined spaces, dense underwater vegetation, boulders and other obstacles.
In addition, there is a small deviation in fishing during the winter for sudake and large trout, and especially in the middle of the winter, when precise and aggressive presentation of the bait is required.
Reaching the furthest points of its trajectory, Bet- A Vib immediately turns around and returns to its original vertical position.
Bait A Vib has been equally successful for winter trout fishing in stagnant waters..
In order to satisfy her whims, there are two modifications, with or without the noise capsule (NS - Nano Sound ) or without it ( SL – Silent ).
It is also noted that the Bet A Vib game is capable of attracting passive fish that do not react even to live bait.
Bait A Vibe's casting distance and accuracy are demonstrated in fishing with the in--wake technique.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, well combines with fishing lines and twine fishing lines even large diameters.
For fishing in pairs, trout, suits, eels and pike, as well as alternating and " staircase " movements, sometimes with " chirping " on the bottom.
When fishing in confined areas, it is possible to change the front tripod to a double tripod, which reduces the likelihood of capture.
Among its class, Bet A Vib is one of the most durable and, as a consequence, one of the most attractive.
With equal success, it can be used on relatively small areas as well as on relatively deep areas.
All models are equipped with hooks Owner ST-36.

Russian view of foreign policy
38% of Russians see more successes in the country's foreign policy than failures, while 29% consider that failures predominate.
" Examples of success - " in Syria they defended and restored peace there, " the decision on the " North Pole 2 " and " the whole world was frightened by the powerful weapons, " they took the Crimea.
The main failures are the conflict with Ukraine, the confrontation with Western countries and isolation from the world, according to the research of the Foundation of Public Opinion.
The government of Dubai has completely rejected the use of paper in the production of documents - all state services also became only digital.
The government of Dubai announced that it was abandoning the production of paper documents and switching to digital technology.
All state services for the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the emirate's information agency WAM.
Tuesday marked the beginning of a new phase in the computerization of all aspects of life in Dubai, the heir to the emirate, chairman of the executive council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Makhtum said on Saturday.
From now on, the internal and external documentation circulation in all government institutions in Dubai would be carried out only in a digital form through special information platforms.
The reform affected all sectors without exception: health care, public utilities, the police, municipal authorities and the courts, as well as many commercial structures. The government's initiative was also embraced by many of these.
The transition to electronic governance and the computerization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which amounted to 14 million hours of human labour and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Earlier mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobinin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Production and export of Turkish automobiles fell below the 2020 level.
Production and export of Turkish automobiles sharply decreased in November due to the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's results for the 11 months were worse than the previous year, according to Bloomberg,, citing figures from the Association of Turkish automobile producers.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were produced in Turkish factories, 20 percent less than the previous year.
The export of 759,000 machines was more than 25 percent lower than the previous year's record.
In the first 10 months of 2021, the automotive sector of Turkey demonstrated a positive dynamism compared to the previous year, but by the end of the 11th month of 2021, the production of automobiles was 3% lower than the previous year.
The reason for this decline was the rapid decline of the Turkish lira, which fell by 29 percent in relation to the dollar in November.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 MSBs received postponement of debt payments in 2021.
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smaioil said about the situation of providing subsidies for small and medium--sized businesses,, transmitted by the correspondent of the MIA "Kashinform.
According to information from the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the regulation and development of the financial market, in the year 2021, in fulfillment of the order of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan from 1 April 2021 and the order of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan from 9 April 2021, the order of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 127 " on the approval of the procedure for the granting of postponed payments of subsidies to small and medium businesses " was issued.
He reminded that the order for the provision of postponed payments of loans granted before 1 April 2021 to micro, small and medium businesses, including individual entrepreneurs, from 1 April to 30 June 2021 stipulated the provision of postponed payments of loans granted before 1 April 2021 to micro, small and medium businesses, including individual entrepreneurs from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The suspension period ranged from 30 to 90 days depending on the choice of the MSB.

Pulmonologist Pulureasev hypothesized that people with weak immune systems are able to easily pass through the strain of " streptococcus ".
A doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be able to carry it more easily than those with strong defensive reactions in their bodies.
Pneumologist Sergey Purosev explained why the strain of the coronavirus " Ocmiorn " could be dangerous.
The cause of the infection lies in the conditions in which the virus is born.
Scientists believe that " okmiorn " originated in infected HIV or immunodeficient cells.
In other words, the mutation did not meet any resistance from the immune system.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that the immune system did not respond,, he became very fast.
Apparently, there are more of these spike- proteins, spikes,, and their antibodies may have not been eliminated during the mutations - commented by the pulmonologist Sergey Puřăsev.
The doctor speculated that people with weakened immune systems may be able to carry the disease more easily than those with strong defensive reactions of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the organism to anything, to any infection - is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s and old people in their 60s die of pneumonia.
The immune response of young beavers is completely inadequate; there,, where only the thumbs could be threatened, they hit as if from cannons on woodpeckers - concluded Sergey Puříasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia is either bacterial or viral.
In the first case, the disease is cured very successfully and quickly, in the second case, the symptoms can only be mitigated, all hope is lost on the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia is the beginning of the intoxication of the organism - this is the temperature, weakness and illness.
Afterwards, respiratory symptoms appear, such as difficulty breathing, hoarseness and coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, abdominal pain may also be indicative of a developing problem.
At the same time, in Russia until the end of the year, they may begin to vaccinate the growing population from 12 to 18 years old.
Virologist and head of the genetic engineering laboratory at the Romanian Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Pavel Volchens said that this category is very vulnerable to the disease.
In teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is maximized.
This is the most socially active layer,, as well as children from orphanages - said Pavle Volchovsky, virologist and director of the genetic engineering laboratory at the Institute of Physics and Technology.

The immunologist proposed the hypothesis that people with obesity become victims of the disease.
The authors of the study examined the residual fat tissue from bariatric operations and found that adipocytes, the cells that make up the fat tissue, can become infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells located in the fat tissue, the macrophages, were also infected and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who died of COVID, and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir to avoid the immune system's response.
It is likely that SARS- CoV 2 is also capable of this.
A biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences, Semyon Goloashekin named the causes of dementia and described methods of its prevention in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to the World Health Organization, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, the person struggles to orientate even in familiar surroundings.
Gološević noted that dementia is most often caused by neurodegenerative diseases, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
On a behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and the absence of active cognitive activity may play a role. - he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by bad habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, irregular sleep patterns and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the experts noted forgetfulness, the inability to concentrate and a decrease in abstract thinking.
Discussions are underway that loss of hearing may be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, or one of the factors contributing to its onset, the biologist added.
To prevent the occurrence of the disease, the World Health Organization recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical fitness, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Earlier professor of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the University of Northern Macedonia.

Egypt returned about 30,000 artifacts illegally removed from the country.
In the last 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to repatriate 30,000 artefacts illegally removed from the country.
He announced this on 11 December in the air of the television channel Al- Hayat, the chief inspector of the department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Ghawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artefacts.
Only this year, in the Museum of the Bible in Washington, 5,300 artifacts from the ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered. - he said.
Abdel Gaouad stated that all of the artifacts smuggled out of the country were recorded in the archives.
At present, staff from the department are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists " track auctions around the world and sales on the internet " through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The main inspector said that after the restoration of cultural artifacts, they are exhibited in museums.
According to his words, one of the returned artefacts was discovered in the ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
The auction house Christie's conducted an auction on July 4,, on which a bust older than 3,000 years was sold for $5.97 million ( approximately 680 million Russian roubles).
This caused discontent in Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that artifacts were illegally removed from the Carnac temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of King Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the god of the sun Amen, was kept in a private collection and was not exhibited on the market since 1985.
The manner in which the relic was brought to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has in recent years actively pursued the repatriation of ancient artefacts illegally removed from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the antiquities smuggled are the result of archaeological excavations by " black diggers ".
"The Caucasian Tatars are not counted " - and this is correct, because the Caucasian Tatars (232,000) are an independent nation ( close to the Turks.
If they wanted to add, only 42,000 people - so many Tatars ( from Kazan ) live in Crimea ( according to the census ).
The Crimean Tatars are a distinct ethnic group and the name of the ethnic group consists of two words.
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT reports that Credit Suisse wants to gain access to the personal mobile devices of its employees.
Credit Suisse demands that its employees provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The reason for this is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue its staff with corporate uniforms, instead offering discounts on the purchase of mobile telephones or smartphones from a partner telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can inspect information on corporate computers issued to its employees, because they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or clients.
Banks have the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if a staff member used it to meet with a client who was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees switched to remote working, the bank wants to extend this rule to all facilities used for resolving work issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline until which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially in Credit Suisse information about the new requirement is not commented.

The last year of Sergei Esenin's life (1925) was productive in terms of his creative work, but the most difficult for the poet's life and his " ego ".
He is not affiliated with any literary organizations, has distanced himself from imaginism, is his own man, but is known, popular and sometimes severely criticized by critics, but the reading public is willing to carry him on its shoulders.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them were genuine masterpieces, the poem " Anna of the Snow " was completed and the book " Soviet Russia " was published.
The main success was in the end of June 25th year, when the State Publishing House signed a contract with the Communist Party of Yugoslavia on the publication of his works in three volumes.
None of the modern Sergey Alexanderovic poets received this honor. he was the first.
At the same time, this was a very lucrative job - according to the contract, the salary was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months ( the factory director received 300 rubles per month, the engineer 200 ).
Money was needed in that year as never before.
Eseinin married Tolstoy's granddaughter Sofya Tolstoy, he had to set up the family's household and maintain his sisters Kata and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life has improved, there is something to celebrate, but for him, everything is colored in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poems " Black Man " ( written in November 1925 and published after his death ) has materialized.

Alcohol poisons the brain.
Many of his acquaintances noted that Eseinin was in poor health and that he was seriously ill.
More and more often, there are repetitions of breakdowns and nervous breakdowns.
and probably not only because of alcoholism.
On the other hand, such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergey Alexandrovich by someone, there are no surviving documents..
The story relates to May 1923, when Eseinin, under pressure from his fourth wife, American Iseidore Duncan, recovered his health in a clinic in Paris under the auspices of Professor Petar Gannanovic. Eseinin returned to him two years later in Moscow.
However, the evidence of the poet's witnesses, scandals related to this topic are scattered across dozens of memoirs - the evidence of the poet's witnesses, scandals related to this topic are scattered across dozens of memoirs.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the poet's tragic romance with the green snake developed rapidly.
At the end of 1923, Eseinin lived for a short time with painter Ivan Starcev.
Unbelievably, even though his income was very good, he never had his own house in Moscow or St. Petersburg. he lived in rented apartments, in guesthouses or with friends.
Starcec recounts.
He only stayed overnight, and in the majority of cases in a drunken and intoxicated state.
One day, returning home at four in the morning, Eseinin fell on the staircase landing.
Padaiya washed his face and coughed.
When he started to calm down, he began coughing, spraying blood all over the floor..
And even Eseinin himself, after the tour of Europe and the United States ( at the time, the United States had a dry law, but Duncan brought a considerable amount of alcohol with him ) admitted that.
"I saw nothing there but taverns and streets.
At the end, and people stopped remembering.
And he drank, of course.
He ate because he was hungry, because he was hungry.

"Not by Sennik's hat: when a velvety jacket turns a man into a laughing stock.
At the social events of 2021, the baroque jackets dominated.
Apparently, the first to announce his new fashion choice was Daniel Craig.
At the premiere of the film " No Time to Die " in September, he appeared in a black and purple velvet jacket and a traditional " bonobo " dress.
After his example was repeated twice by Prince William, who first wore an inappropriate green baroque jacket for the ceremony awarding the Earthshot Prize, and then chose a more classic version for a charity event in support of the Royal Variety.
A few weeks ago, the trend was tested on himself and Lionel Messi..
The football player received the seventh " Golden Ball " in a baroque jacket from Dolce and Gabbana.
In addition, his sons were dressed in similar uniforms.
Ali Express has already noted the growing demand for baroque male jackets in Russia.
According to the analysts of the service, they were bought in 1.4 times more.
The most popular are the warm, velvety baroque jackets with a cushion and an upright silhouette, the main colors being dark brown, burgundy, dark purple and, inevitably, black.
The average price of such models is between 3,000 and 6,000 rupees. Men prefer to buy exclusively jackets, baroque costumes they choose less often.
They can be bought not only by online retailers.
The budget versions are available in H&M, Mango and Next, as well as Zara.
In the segment of luxury jackets, baroque jackets are almost present in all brands - such as Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro and Saint Laurent.
The most desired is the Gucci model, in which actor Jared Leto starred in one of the premiere films " House of Gucci " ambassador of the brand.
Choosing jackets from well--known brands guarantees that the baroque is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technique of interweaving the threads, a thick fabric is produced with a fibrous outer surface and a smooth inner surface.
More economical variants are made from cotton or polyamide,, but they last less.
The fashion expert of Lamoda, Ilya Vahoschkin, points out that in the case of the baroque jacket, the most important thing is not its model or fashion,, but its suitability.
"Baroque requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal for gatherings in the evening or at a festive event - as explained by Wahowski. It is also suitable for the occasions when the invitation mentions a dress code of " black tie " or " creative black tie ".
The other important criterion, fulfillment of which permits the choice of the baroque jacket is the status of its purchaser.
A man in a baroque jacket, first and foremost, needs to acquire a proper, advanced social life with enough money - according to the authors of the men's fashion blog Krasaavich Brammell. Men who wear baroque jackets usually belong to the group of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to attend formal social events, which always have a dress code.
Ilya Vahoschkin proposes to combine the baroque jacket with similar uniform items, such as classical uniforms with stripes, one--tone shirts, silk waistcoats with feathers and epaulettes.
Too ordinary and everyday things would look out of place.
The fashion experts from " Krasavica Brammelela " are convinced that the appearance of a sergeant wearing a baroque jacket was inappropriate, but that the appearance of a " manager " from among those who managed the event was appropriate.
If a lower--ranking officer, and his goal is to advance his position in the complex hierarchy of the company or to obtain financial bonuses,, he would be better off wearing a velvet jacket.

The full scheme of protection from COVID-19 was revealed.
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, honorary scientist of Russia, Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection from coronavirus infection.
According to his words, this can be achieved by the introduction of injections and the use of nasal vaccines.
When used internationally, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are formed. However, this does not occur when vaccines are injected.
Immunglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, therefore the virus cannot penetrate the organism.
Inside, after vaccination, the largest amount of immunoglobulin G ( antibody ) is formed.
If both vaccines are introduced, a lot of immunoglobulins A and G are produced., but there is no solution for double vaccination.
The main advantage of nasal vaccination combined with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of the disease.
He added that this would help those who, in such a case, would be able to protect their bodies,, presumably, to the maximum.

The World Health Organization discovered " omikron " already in six decades of states.
The World Health Organization (WHO ) announced that the new strain of the coronavirus " Omicron " has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain may have catastrophic consequences.
The speed of the spread of the strain was reported in a statement by the World Health Organization.
According to the organization's figures, the strain has been detected in 63 countries and in all six regions of the World Health Organization.
This is despite the fact that it became active only at the end of November.
The WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization's experts are concerned that the new strain, as of preliminary reports, may surpass the degree of spread of the " delta " strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which currently dominates in all countries without exception.
Before the general director of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced that the omikron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the pandemic of the coronavirus.
Similar conclusions were also reached in Great Britain.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) consider that " Omicron " will replace " Delta " in the coming months.
The number of those affected only in Britain is estimated to be around 1 million, despite the fact that officially " Omicron " is currently present in the Kingdom with several hundred people and, according to estimates, up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the " Omicron " strain, and at its peak, hospitals would have more than 2,000 people admitted each day.
The British system of health care is not in a position to cope.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of vaccines from the company Pfizer- Biontech against the " Omicron " strain is 32 times lower than the other strains of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian " Sputnik V " reacts to " omikron " - this will become clear in the next few weeks.

The Russians warned of a new scheme of mischief makers.
Criminals began to seek new ways to commit fraud in video messages.
According to " Izvestia " with reference to experts,.
According to Ivideon's director of products, Seaur Aubutalimov,, the main danger associated with the spread of video communications is disinformation.
In this case, the mischief makers create a fake video based on real footage with the participation of victims.
Thanks to this, neural networks are able to accurately reproduce the behaviour of certain individuals.
Abu Talimov added that using disguise, criminals may call familiar victims via video-conferences or create video clips with the participation of copies of human beings for distribution with the purpose of intimidation.
" Such imitations can easily lead to brawls, because a malicious perpetrator can place people in improbable, dangerous or compromising scenarios. " said the expert.

There are five actions that help to avoid the disease of sugar diabetes.
Problems with blood sugar levels - one of the most widespread in the world.
However, some do not consider this to be of great importance, and wrongly.
Sweet diabetes may eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Prophylactic measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water, which positively affects metabolism.
Sweet products increase the level of sugar in the blood to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the path to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by improper diet,, but also by habits.
In order to reduce the risks of sugar diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Specialists advise to follow a low-- carbohydrate diet.
A similar diet not only helps to reduce weight, but also protects against sudden changes in sugar levels.
For protection from the disease of diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of cellulose.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus facilitate the feeling of hunger, secretion of digestive juices and increase the absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlov spoke about the " migraine exit day " for truck drivers.
Several factors may contribute to the deterioration of one's well-being in the weekend.
The reason for the deterioration of one's well-being after working days is often " migraine on the day after work ", according to the statement of a famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences and senior scientific researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the University of Moscow and the scientific director of the Systemic Medicine Clinic Zhuhr Pavlov in his telegram channel.
According to her, this is particularly common among truck drivers,, who often suffer from headaches, brokenness and weakness on their days off.
Dr. Pavlov noted that in addition to the accumulation of fatigue over the course of a week, there are many objective reasons for the negative reaction of the organism to the change of conditions.
In the weekends, one's life fundamentally changes.
"Sleeping for a long time and spending the whole day on the couch, they eat more and drink less, the doctor argued. - Due to the lack of coffee, a small breakdown begins..
Due to overeating and lack of water, weakness and disorientation.
An additional role is played by the late rise.
In other words, if one stands up three hours later than usual,, there is a reaction called jetlag.
It is caused by travellers who cross several time zones.
In order to determine which of the factors plays the most decisive role in the deterioration of health, Pavlov recommended to follow the changes that are the most significant in the weekends.

The amount of hidden sugar in common products.
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
His excessive presence in the diet can lead to diabetes of the second type, as well as heart and respiratory diseases and cancer.
Consumers must take into account that under the name of an unknown ingredient in the composition of a product, hidden sugar, an ingredient similar to sugar in caloric content, composition and glycemic index may be mentioned.
The label may contain up to 100 different names for sugar.
One of the most common and frequently encountered names - glucose and fructose.
There are also other sugars that can be extracted,, such as dextrose ( obtained from corn ), levulose ( fruit sugar ) melasse ( black tobacco ) and so on.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery items,, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausages, and so on.
According to the statement of the Russian Ministry of Agriculture, the most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to eat whole and unprocessed products, and also to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar have different tastes, but they are all called the same ingredient in the composition of the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - but they still remain sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar stated on the packaging by the manufacturer,, but also the fact that fruits and vegetables initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Consequently, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.

At the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on 12 December ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced in the afternoon of 12 December, the majority of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted against independence during the referendum.
On the other hand, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51 percent (2,755 people) voted for independence from France, while 96.49 percent (75 762 ) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90 percent overall, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participating in the elections.
The outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubts, as the independence supporters called the voters not to participate in the voting.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on 12 December, considering that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago made it impossible to conduct a full and " honest " pre-- election campaign.
As a result, this lack of participation opened the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 percent of the population voted against independence, in 2020, 53.3 percent.
The separatists stated that they did not recognise the results of the referendum and disputed them in the UN.
As announced in the Elysian Palace on 12 December, the president of France, Emmanuel Macron would announce the results of the referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence was revived in the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several candidates for the presidency expressed the opinion that the territory should remain part of France because it is " the last region of the European Union in the Pacific Ocean.
"New Caledonia must remain French " - Eric Zemmur reiterated.
A similar statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on Caledonians to remain French.
From his side, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position because it was not his responsibility.
However, the president added: " France would have been less beautiful without New Caledonia.
Premier Minister Jean Castecs, on his side, expressed " a strong desire that the election of the Caledonians was an election of France ".

In the airport, two lions escaped from a container.
In the Changi airport in Singapore, lions escaped.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two hunters managed to escape from the container with seven lions arriving on one of the planes..
The publication notes that it is not known from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the fugitive lions laid down on the roof of the container..
The animals were unable to escape because of the protective fences that were set up around it.
The confrontation ended after the arrival of the staff of the Mandai Wildlife Group, who are in charge of all of Singapore's zoos.
They disarmed the lions with dart guns and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that in Pnompenh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the wolf voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Specialists warned of the threat of cancer from vitamin B9.
Research indicates that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid,, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to specialists, there are significant evidence that people who do not suffer from a lack of folic acid are less likely to suffer from certain types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, excessive doses of radiation on the other hand facilitate the growth of cancerous cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietologist Beth Kitchin advises to follow the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if it significantly deviates from this figure in a large or small way.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, to observe the dosage and to avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Earlier consultant on nutrition Raychele Fain called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since she, among other things, contains avocado,, Fayne advised men over 50 to eat this fruit more often.
In the United Kingdom, by April, due to the Omicron strain, about 75,000 people may have died.
British scientists predict that, due to the spread of the omikron strain of the coronavirus, up to 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months, or even earlier.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian with reference to an investigation by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
According to the most optimistic prognosis of the experts who are part of the scientific advisory group of the British Cabinet Office, by April 2022, the country had recorded more than 25,000 deaths from the strain of Omicron, and more than 175,000 hospitalized patients.
At the peak of the epidemic, 2,000 infected people would be admitted to the hospital each day.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be necessary to prevent overcrowding in the National Health Service if the omikron strain proves to be more infectious than the delta variant and the existing vaccines are unable to prevent infection. " said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Earlier, the Agency for Health and Safety in the United Kingdom announced that, if the rate of spread of the Omicron strain continues at the current level, by the end of the year there would be 1 million cases of infection in the country.
At the same time, by the middle of December, the Omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom, 1,898 cases of the Omicron strain of the coronavirus have been identified, of which 633 were recorded in the last 24 hours.
On the other hand, on 9 December, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid indicated that the actual figure could be as high as 10,000 cases.
He wanted to write a witty comment,, but only got as far as this point.
"Shuubo, obtained as a result of the unimaginable suffering of the unfortunate animal and its employment in the second job.

The number of supertankers increased in the world by a quarter.
Construction of superyachts in 2016 and orders for 2017 broke all world records, despite calls to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the fight against climate change.
In the world's register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units, a quarter more than in the previous year.
In the era of battles against the consequences of climate change, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people with the desire and money to build a floating fortress worth more than 50 million US dollars would decrease.
However, they become more and more numerous.
In this year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
The brokers say that such a frenzy on the market has not been seen for 20 years.
The first reason is that many of those who can afford to own a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on the deck of their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Previously, all these people worked in offices and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely and negotiations are conducted by telephone.
Shipbuilder William Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts in 2025 and later.
This means that the owners were willing to pay more, only if their yacht was ready two or three years earlier.
" People simply crave freedom, the super- rich can afford to do so., he says.
In western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, according to sociologists, do not want to understand that, in times of space travel, life on yachts or private airplane flights, the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists call on the government to act and propose introducing new taxes and rules for super--rich, although they acknowledge that it would be extremely difficult to implement this.
On the other hand, the impressive number of superyachts ordered, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 ships, 27 are over 100 meters in length.
The Norwegian billionaire Rokke is building the 183 metre long yacht Revenge Ocean.
After sinking into the water, it will be the largest ship in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a " lunar pool " and also a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
On the existing superyachts, helicopter pads and open--air cinemas were built, and on some of them, such as the yacht of boxer Macgregor, platforms for boxing matches were built. Professor Richard Wilk of the American University of Indiana said that compared to the number of carbon dioxide and methane emissions produced by superyachts, they are insignificant.
However, it has symbolic meaning, since there are more than 2,000 multimillionaires in the world.
This is just another example of excessive consumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists discovered that the emission signature of billionaires is 10,000 times greater than the signature of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of carbon dioxide per year, Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere in 2018.
On the other hand, two thirds of the emission traces landed on his yacht Eclipse, 162.5 meters in length.
Even if there are no owners on board the yachts, the crew continues to pollute the planet..
The owner can call the captain and give him the order to sail the yacht,, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Owners of superyachts do not elicit sympathy from other people when they, as the richest woman in Australia, Gina Reinhard, who owns harbours on the continent, complained through YouTube that their giant ships have no berths.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marines for ships with a length of 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of cancer of the stomach.
American scientists determined that the amount of alcoholic drinks consumed in a week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express..
Specialists came to the conclusion that the consumption of four or more portions of alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
On the other hand, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
In addition, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of contracting cancer of the kidney than women.
The exact cause of the development of this type of cancer is not known, and scientists have only noted that certain factors lead to a harmful process in the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two--year old child.
Many dog lovers believe that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they do not realize that quadruped mammals have evolved to a great extent.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to try to determine how intelligence develops in animals.
Although the vocabulary of dogs is not as extensive as that of humans, a new study has shown that dogs can react to 89 words or phrases.
The work of the scientists was published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or write poetry, they have no meaning in politics, economics and art, but they often outwit their owners.
Representatives of some breeds are considered by experts to have the best results in understanding human language,, but there are not enough statistical data to make precise conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered to be dog geniuses, such as Labrador retrievers.
Scientists came to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking and are able to learn as well as a two--year old child.

In Ukraine, preparations were made for the trade between the United States and Russia.
The United States and Russia would be " negotiating " over the issue of Ukraine's entry into NATO, according to Alexander Cocheotkov, an analyst, in his article for the publication " Glavred " .
According to his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations on the issue of guarantees for the United States regarding the fact that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to join wherever they want.
If they offer something that is obviously unacceptable,, for example, selling a close relative in a sexual slavery,, they do not negotiate and simply send them away.
In relation to Ukraine, there is a trade agreement - the analyst wrote.
Kocetkov added that Russia does not intend to attack Ukraine, and seeks dialogue with Kiev.
The preparations are carried out secretly, quickly and immediately move to the offensive, and not wait for the enemy to detect and deploy forces to oppose them. - he noted.
China is encouraging the development of railway transport.
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 International Railway and Production Equipment Exhibition held in the city of Chengdu in the province of Hunan in Central China.
The main technologies developed by the company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow locomotives to automatically detect and diagnose technical defects, noted the company's representative Hou Chao-wen.
High--speed trains running on the railway line between China and Laos, which was inaugurated in the beginning of the month, are already equipped with these technologies, ensuring increased reliability and operability of the locomotives.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased exports of railway transport vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe have become witnesses of " Chinese speed.
In May of this year, the production line of the company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd produced the first two-- decked high- speed electric train designed for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains would run on railway tracks in Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the above- named company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the line of the metro connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement on this line of the metro will be opened in the following year.
This is the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
The Chinese industry for producing equipment for railway transportation is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international competitiveness, according to Feng Yao-sian, head of the trade and investment department of the Chinese Committee for supporting the development of international trade.
"This sector constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high--class equipment on the world market,, said Feng Yao-shan.
After more than 60 years of intense work, after conducting a number of independent research and development projects, China created a state--of the art system for the production of railway transport equipment, with a full complement of auxiliary facilities and large-- scale production activities.
According to Feng Yao-sian, the country occupies first place in terms of the level of electrification of railway tracks and in terms of the operational mileage on high--speed and urban railway tracks.
The biologist identified early signs of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences, Semeon Goloashekin in an interview with radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, symptoms of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive disruptions, such as the inability to concentrate, plan, and a decrease in abstract thinking.
At present, it is being discussed that loss of hearing may be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, or one of the risk factors for its emergence, said the specialist.
Gološević emphasized that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, certain infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and arteriosclerosis of the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that, as of today, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prophylaxis early.
According to him, the risk of developing dementia is reduced by studying foreign languages and actively interacting with others.
Also, the WHO recommends maintaining moderate levels of physical exertion and regularly training cognitive skills with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logical thinking.
There are recommendations for the use of various BAADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still debated in the scientific community, as Gološević said.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical exertion, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logic thinking. - Gološević said.
Earlier, a charitable organization for the investigation of dementia in Great Britain announced that the disease is increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Medics named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first symptom of the disease can be considered as problems with vision, due to which the patient has difficulties in recognizing objects.
One of the signs of developing weakness is called aphasia, when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment.
The former president of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili is in need of psychological and neurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, according to neurologist Otar Toidze, a member of the medical council of the ombudsman of Georgia.
His ( Saakashvili ) neurological status is leading in his illness.
Stability problems are problems with movement, coordination and variability, he said, noting that this does not exceed the norm and that the former president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
This is called neural rehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, which is not possible in Georgia, he said, and demanded that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
In the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began sabotaging the receipt of medical assistance after being disciplined by prison staff.
The Georgian politician was able to quickly overturn the punishment and restore himself to his previous privileges.

In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they described the " painful withdrawal " in relations between Russia and the United States.

One--sided negative predictability exists, but in some areas there is a perception of improvement in relations, which is completely unpredictable.
This sad conclusion after a long journey with the current administration and with Trump and Obama.
The problems began not yesterday - the diplomat indicated.
According to Ryaabkov, the problems stem from the United States' desire to force Russia to adopt its approach on a number of issues.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he did not dare to give optimistic predictions about the prospects of improving relations and did not expect a change in the position of Washington.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cyber security, progress has not been made.

The virologist warned of the danger of vaccinating with nasal preparation from the flu in hospitals.
People who have been vaccinated with nasal vaccine for COVID-19 may suffer from allergies and need medical assistance, which is why the first points for the administration of this vaccine should not be set up in airports and shopping centers.
This was announced by Tass biologist and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of biological nanotechnology, microbiology and virology at the New Siberian University, Sergey Netezov.
Organizing vaccination points for nasal vaccination in airports and shopping centers is easier, but it was only done initially in medical institutions.
The reason for this is that the possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable for the person to stay in the vicinity of the doctor's office after it.
Doctors have special sets of anti- allergic preparations, which act within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary - said Neetes.
According to the views of the virologist, the possibility of vaccinating in the shopping centers can be considered when there is experience in using the vaccine.
He also emphasized that it is important that the nasal vaccine is deposited on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
On the other hand, there is a possibility that the vaccine does not reach its destination if the person infected with nasal catarrh sneezes after being injected.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were named for Zelensky.
The former deputy of the Supreme Court, Vadim Denisenko listed four possible developments for President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to his opinion, the head of state can remain without the support of the West and, possibly, reach a compromise on the Donbass.
On the 12th of December, Denisenko spoke about this in a publication on the portal "Glavred.
The first variant, which Denisenko called " ideal storm " presupposes that Ukraine ceased to support the key western countries and reached an agreement about the future of the country without its participation.
This development of events would contribute to a deep crisis, with which Kyiv could face in 2023.
" At the same time, there is a decrease in the prices of key goods, which are traditionally exported by the country. There are also internal protests and opposition to the power of the key FPG groups. " added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all.
In the event of high turbulence in world politics, when the Ukrainian government is confronted with a number of problems,, the prognosis is fulfilled.
Due to this situation, the leadership of Ukraine may make compromises in the Donbass region, as a result of which possible opposition within the country may arise.
At the end of the year, Zelenisky's position weakened and the likelihood of such a situation, according to the words of the former minister, was between 50 and 55 percent.
The third variant of the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition of those who disagree with the Zelensky group and the president, because of which a possible seizure of control over the military bloc and the realization of " populist initiatives " is possible.
In the course of this variant of the crisis, Zelenysky began " to reform the power structure, " added Denisenko.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the " father of the nation.
This may be caused by some event, which becomes a major disruption to society.
The event must be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine,, said Denisenko.

Estonian scientists are searching for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three cosmic missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, announced on Sunday by the " Actual Camera ".
The goal of the five- year missions is to assess the suitability of Venus's atmosphere for life and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartarian scientists proposed instruments for measuring acidity and oxygen content in Venus clouds.
Until now, it was believed that Venus's clouds were too acidic to sustain life, but it is likely that Venus was originally a terrestrial planet.
During the third mission, a probe was sent to Venus.
It is assumed that if life is found there, the main question is whether it is similar to earthly or different.
If they are very similar, it would be obvious that life on Earth did not originate on Earth.
However, if there is a difference, it is possible that the origin of life on Earth is more likely. - the leader of the Estonian team of the " Venus Life Finder " project, Mikhail Paijasal said.

The theme of the metaverse became popular in the fall of 2016 when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new form of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, is investing in the creation of its own metaspheres and their subsequent monetization.
Metaphysicals should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.

The British economist was unable to predict the 2022 year.
The British economist Jim O'Neill could not give a forecast for the 2022 year, because, according to his opinion, such attempts would end in failure.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert considers that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend could change.
The most important factor remains the pandemic of the coronavirus, and on the second place is inflation,, according to him.
O'Nill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in the price of goods was temporary or permanent.
Before the pandemic, it was clear that " the world's endless abundance of central bank cash had outlived itself " and that it was time to return to a system where percentages were based on anticipated rates of growth in GDP.
O'Neill noted that in the wake of the pandemic, the continuation of the excessively high economic policy could lead to a new upsurge in inflation, according to some experts.
In addition to this, attention should be paid to the issue of growth in productivity, as well as the increase in levels of poverty and the change in climate, recalled O'Nill.
Earlier, the head of the global research department " Opening Investments " Michail Shuulgin announced that the positive expectations for the course of the dollar in 2022 remain and that the potential growth would be less significant.

In the first 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2.784 million roubles on the purchase of new cars, 28 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI.
To understand the scale,, approximately the same amount ( around 3 billion roubles ) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the pandemic of the coronavirus.
In September 2020, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5% of the internal gross domestic product (GDP) of the country in 2020.
The most profitable brand on the Russian market is the Korean brand Kia.
In the first 10 months of the year, he managed to realise 325.7 million roubles worth of vehicles, an increase of 24 percent compared to the previous year.
The related Kia brand's growth is even more significant - more than 35 % and the revenue from the sale of machines is estimated at 279.3 million roubles.

Hyundai - nearly 12 percent.

The Japanese follow Mercedes--Benz with 266.1 billion rupees (+ 75 % - and the German premium brand increased its sales ( by 37 % and the average price of an automobile ( by 28 % to 8.2 million rupees.
"At the same time, Mercedes--Benz is experiencing a good increase in sales and an average price that is higher than that of BMW - for example, more than that of BMW - which means a greater increase in financial capacity.

They regularly change the prices of their products and other manufacturers do the same.
The volume of the automotive market in Russia in terms of money is increasing and further, in addition to the shortage of machines, its contribution to this is inflation, and also the desire of the car manufacturers to compensate for previous losses, according to experts.
In the conditions of a shortage of cars, it is believed that many car manufacturers were able to partially compensate for the expenditures of previous periods, which they were unable to incorporate into the price of the cars before.
says the analyst of " VTB Capital " Vladimir Bessapolov. -
It is believed that the financial situation of the automotive producers is very good at the moment, with high margins on sales.
Concomitant indicators of this are the increase in the prices of new cars observed in 2021, which are growing faster than inflation, according to the expert.
In the long term, the market will grow and in terms of quantity and in terms of money, but mainly due to inflation and the increase in the complexity of the construction of the machines, predicts Bessapolov.
With the increase in supply, the possibility of raising the price is limited.

Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, now, automobile manufacturers are striving to obtain the highest profit with each sold automobile, as noted by Burgazliev.
Increases in the production of machines are not expected to take place in the next six months at least, and in Russia, this is further aggravated by citizens' lack of confidence in the future.
Against the backdrop of the market situation, cars became a good object for investment,, even after a year of use,, the machine can now be sold for more than its initial cost,, according to the expert.
