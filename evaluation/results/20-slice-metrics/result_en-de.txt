According to Press TV, the Ministry announced on Saturday that 58 Iranians died from the disease, noting that out of the new cases detected over the past 24 hours, 286 patients were admitted to hospital.
It added that 615,252 people in the country have contracted the disease and 596,373 of the infected people recovered and were discharged from hospitals.
According to the Ministry, 3,126 COVID-9 patients are in intensive care units ( ICU ) while 39,951,481 diagnosis tests have been so far conducted across Iran.
Coronavirus figures have been on a downward trend since the government started a mass vaccination campaign.
So far, 58,595,066 people have received the first dose of the COVID vaccine, 49,157,835 have received the second dosage and 2,237,841 have gotten the booster shots.
The total number of vaccines injected in the country reached 109,990,742 doses.
Over the past 24 hours, 19 provinces reported almost no death case or only one dead.
According to the latest figures, eight cities are in the orange zones, 119 in the yellow category and 321 cities are in the blue zones.
There is no city in the high- risk red zone.
Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber said on Wednesday that the country is fully prepared to roll out coronavirus booster vaccinations.

Missed out on Shiba Inu.
EVERgrow may be the next big crypto to explode in 2022.
Shiba Inu is the latest meme-crypto to go viral and despite being down almost 60% from it's all-time high, the market cap still stands at an eye-watering $20 billion, making it the 12th biggest crypto in the world by valuation.
A $100 investment at launch would be worth over $2 million today.
Many are no doubt kicking themselves for missing out on such gains, but the reality is that a bet on Shiba Inu was a pure gamble.
Shiba's run was a combination of some very smart marketing and a whole lot of hype, that led droves of investors, with FOMO ( fear of missing out ) to pile into the meme-coin.
Even the name itself, which was a homage to Elon Musk backed Dogecoin, was all part of the design.
In reality, Shiba Inu offers no tangible utility or value, with seemingly little effort to do so in the future.
Being on the Ethereum blockchain, there would have been plenty of opportunity for development had the team behind Shiba Inu been motivated to do so.
There are, however, several cryptocurrencies that are working to rise above the pack and back their popularity with real utility and fundamental value.
Just 10 weeks ago, Evergrow Coin (EGC) was launched by a team of experienced finance, blockchain and marketing experts.
One groundbreaking element of their project is the fact the token pays a stable currency to holders.
In the short time since launch, holders of Evergrow Coin have received over $30 million of binance- pegged USD rewards - a stable and regulated currency pegged 1 to 1 with the USD.
The project currently has 110,000 holders according to BSCscan.
With their revolutionary contract, Evergrow Coin quickly grew to over $1 billion in market cap, but then a major data error on Coinmarketcap, just weeks into the launch, caused mass panic amongst investors.
With such a new project, trust can take time to build, and this panic was exploited by a series of articles, rumoured to have been paid for by rivals of the project, using the incorrect data to try to draw Evergrow investors away from the project.
Over the next month, the errors remained unfixed, and Evergrow sank to below $300 million in valuation.
Yesterday, Coinmarket Cap placed an alert on Evergrow's page confirming that the data error had been fixed.
The price has now stabilised, and signs of returning confidence saw an increase of 22% from the recent lows.
However, Evergrow still remains well below the highs achieved before this error.
Evergrow is very different from Shiba Inu.
In addition to the obvious benefits of USD rewards, the team behind the project have already launched a SWap dApp on their website, have recently revealed the upcoming release of a Crypto Wallet, promising to surpass the features offered by Trust Wallet or Safemoon Wallet and have a whole suite of utilities, from content creation platform to NFT Market Place and Lending designed to bring continuous value to investors.
Is Evergrow Coin the next Shiba Inu.
With Shiba Inu offering little to no utility, valued at around 66 times that of Evergrow Coin, there is a clear argument for an innovative and groundbreaking project like Evergrow to see some serious upside from their current low market cap.
If the team continues to impress the crypto community with their innovation and transparency and can shake off the fear spread among investors by the Coinmarketcap errors, there is a good chance Evergrow Coin could be one of the top cryptos to invest in for 2022.
Thanks to his waiting time, he has checked the information into his account.
He is really sorry to know that he is having this issue with his ebook, but he is willing to help him.
I'll share with a couple of steps to perform into his device, okay.
He is in HR and has worked payroll in the past.
If someone comes to him and tells him that they are working to get out of a financially abusive relationship and their abuser looks at their paystubs.
they might be able to help.
Depending on the company.
He has not had to do any of the above, but he has had to keep staff off the directories and teach reception to pretend they didn't know who someone was and how to identify the abuser if he came by.
He could make an arrangement to syphon money as an after tax deduction, give the deduction an incongruous name that makes it look like some sort of obligatory deduction and then "remit " the deduction back to him separately.
He would probably have to sign an agreement..
Another thing he might be able to do is to have a fake email conversation with him about why his paystubs are going missing or why his password is not working ( after he changes it ) and how they are " trying to figure this out, thank him for his patience.
They don't have this but some employers can issue all or part of a paycheck onto their own debit card, no bank needed.
Also, many employers have various underutilized employee support services.
These can range from counseling help, legal insurance, to discounts and coupons.
It is worth asking what they have so that they can take advantage of anything that helps.
Some gyms allow people to rent lockers.
It is not an ideal place to hide things as theft is a risk, but it is an option that might work for some..
For his information, he would send him a transcript of their conversation.
If he has any further questions or concerns, he can always reply back to that email and they will be able to help him further.
It was a pleasure to help #PRS Org. today..
I hope he has an excellent day.
He knows what he understands.
since they want him to have his order from them.
As a courtesy on his first order, he will process a full amount credit on this order so he can use this credit to place an order with the right branch.

This is the thing people don't understand.
The math does not say that it is impossible for a young and healthy person to become seriously ill.
Maybe he is a pessimist, but that is better than thinking he is invincible..
That shit will get him killed.
He took it seriously because he has been sick a lot, and he hates it.
He is healthy in general, but the flu always hits him very hard.
He was afraid that Covid would be worse.
It was not, probably because he was not exposed to a lot of the virus,, but it was bad enough.
It took months for his body to return to normal.
I don't know why it affects people differently, but for me it was body pain and headaches that were the worst part.

Scholz, Polish prime minister discuss migration and energy and the EU.
Germany 's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw Sunday for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki about migration, energy, European Union matters and tensions east of the bloc 's border.
He was greeted by Morawiecki, with military honors, in front of the Polish premier's office..
It was one of Scholz's early visits after he was sworn in with his coalition Cabinet on Wednesday.
Poland is a vocal opponent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry Russian gas directly to Germany saying it makes Europe dependent on Russia's deliveries and exposes it to pressure from Moscow.
Germany's regulator has suspended the approval procedure for the completed pipeline because of legal issues.
The government in Warsaw is also involved in an intensifying dispute with the European Commission, the EU 's executive arm, which is withholding pandemic recovery funds from Poland saying the government 's policies erode judicial independence there.
Scholz and Morawiecki are also to discuss complex bilateral relations under Germany 's new government.
The good neighborly ties are still overshadowed by World War II, especially under Poland's current right-wing government, which is saying Germany owes Poland compensation for wartime damages.
Agnieszka Lada- Konefal, the deputy director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt, Germany, expects Scholz 's government to continue dialogue and contact with Poland, which is an important member on EU 's eastern flank and Germany 's fifth largest trading partner.
The visit comes 30 years after the two parliaments ratified a treaty on good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation.
Germany 's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Warsaw on Friday.
She voiced Germany's support for Poland which has sealed its eastern frontier to migrants who are apparently encouraged by the Belarus government to seek illegal passage.
She also called for humanitarian treatment of the migrants stuck at the border.
Poland and the EU say the government of Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko is seeking to destabilize the bloc by encouraging migration into its countries.
On Friday, Scholz met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and later with EU and NATO officials in Brussels.
Scholz, a center- left politician, became Germany 's ninth post- World War II chancellor, opening a new era for the EU 's most populous nation and largest economy after Angela Merkel 's 16 year tenure.
His government is made up of a coalition of his center- left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro- business Free Democrats.
He knows it is in Chinese, he does not need to use his device's internal function nor the correct language to perform these last steps sent.
It would be a favor for him to read them first and then perform them.

Warning of stormy weather as strong winds present " danger to life "
Storm force winds are set to batter northern parts of Scotland with disruption to travel, especially ferry services, expected.
The northwest, Shetland and Orkney will face gusts of up to 85 mph overnight on Sunday into Monday morning.
The Hebrides and the western coast of the Highlands and parts of Argyll and Bute have been warned to be prepared for flying debris presenting a " danger to life " and causing damage to buildings.
Experts are warning that the bad weather could lead to power cuts, road and bridge closures, and cancellations to air and ferry services.
It follows two named storms, Arwen and Barra, that brought widespread disruption to large parts of the country.
More than 100,000 homes had their power cut off by the extreme damage wrought by Storm Arwen on November 26 and 27.
Storm Barra disrupted supplies to around 10,000 just 11 days later on December 7.
Stv weather presenter Philip Petrie said it was very nearly three in a row.
The Met Office were keeping an eye on a low pressure system that is skirting along northwestern areas overnight on Sunday bringing with it very strong winds and squally, heavy showers.
The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind with the first coming into force from 9pm on Sunday covering the Western Isles and parts of the Highlands and Argyll and Bute.
Within this area there is the potential of gusts reaching 80-85 mph causing disruption to ferries and also some damage and power cuts, Philip said.
A further warning comes into effect at midnight on Sunday covering Orkney and Shetland.
This warning will last until midday on Monday as the centre of the low pressure system moves close to the Northern Isles, again bringing gusts of 80-85 mph along coasts and locally in excess of 90 mph in some areas.
"It is very fast moving though, so will clear away by Monday afternoon, with things beginning to ease and calm by lunchtime.
For the rest of the week things will continue to settle ahead of next weekend.
He can also reset it from there..
However, he recommends resetting it from his computer, even if he is logged in on his computer, this is for him to remember his password, as this information is important to know by memory.
Once his password was reset from his computer, he tried to access again on his daughter's e-reader with his new password.

Water heater temperature and bath issue.
The water heater is set pretty low.
It is a small tank in a closet ( he lives in an old pre-war apartment ).
The question is that it fills the bathtub up all the way without going cold.
If he only bathes once a week ( but showers every 2 days or so ) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, it is worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath.
or he would save more electricity by heating up his stock pot on the stove and adding it to the bath once the water heater is emptied.
Thanks everyone for the advice.
He turned up the heat just a little and it worked.
The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct bc even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has so much insulation.
It's hard to get to so I 'm leaving it at that temperature and calling it a day.
Long queues for Banksy 's shirts supporting statue- toppling protesters.
Crowds desperate to buy shirts designed by the mysterious street artist Banksy have been seen in Bristol, UK.
They were released to support protesters on trial for toppling a slave trader statue during a Black Lives Matter march.
Banksy designed the limited edition " souvenir shirts " to mark the trial of four people charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year.
"All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint " the artist wrote on Instagram.
Sold for £25 ($33 ) plus VAT and limited to only one item per person at several shops, the shirt has been in such demand that people queued around blocks to get it.
An almost two minute long video posted on Twitter shows an endless line of customers.
The UK media reported that " thousands " were eager to raise money for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with " Bristol " written above it.
It refers to a toppled bronze memorial to the 17th century merchant Edward Colston, who was involved in the transatlantic slave trade.
The activists, known as the " Colston Four " are facing a trial at Bristol Crown Court next week, charged with inflicting criminal damage to a monument belonging to the city council.
The men - who have all pleaded not guilty - are accused of sinking the statue " without lawful excuse "
He was praised by some for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death, the controversial trader's statue was attacked in June 2020, when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM ) movement was happening in the city.
The damaged plinth and graffitied statue was later recovered by the city council from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown during the unrest, and re-emerged as a local museum exhibit, alongside a curated selection of BLM posters from the march.
A sculpture of a BLM protester was erected on the empty plinth previously occupied by Colston.

People with disabilities in the United States are not treated well at all. full stop.

They would see fewer traffic accidents and deaths.
Health care and child care would be affordable and much easier access, and so on.

Molecular Diagnosis Test can detect the Omicron variant in 20 minutes.
Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants.
The technology development has been completed, and it is expected to take time for commercialization.
Postech announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online.
Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus.
According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single nucleotide base, so it can detect " Stealth Omicron " which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests.
Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID 19 variants: whole genome analysis, target DNA ( mutations such as spike protein ) analysis and PCR test.
In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot.
The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology.
The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid- binding reactions only when the COVID 19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection.
According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes.
In the case of " Stealth Omicron " both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants.
The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently.
Unlike conventional technology, which generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes ( more than 250 samples per hour ).
In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily.
As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future.
"The revelation of this technology will help them return to normal daily life as soon as possible " said Professor Lee.
They will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19.
This technology is currently before commercialization..
However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed..
Professor Lee said, "I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials.
The reason for disclosing the technology is to share it with others to develop better technologies for overcoming COVID-19 and to allow underdeveloped countries to also analyze COVID 19 variants.

In some communities, the church provides a safe place for some persecuted social groups..
It is not a coincidence that the civil rights movement was very much intertwined with minority churches, mosques and temples.
Ahmad Aubrey's trial is also an example of positive impact.
The Satanic Temple is also doing good things..
However, examples where something is very wrong with the system have always been evident.
Religious organizations and institutions are generally held to the same standards as any other charitable organization.
Transparency is the name of the game.
Looking at cases like the Catholic Church, it might be advisable to ensure funds acquired by these tax-exempt religious organizations don't leave the country.
When thinking of religious membership, a cooperative model is useful, each member has a single vote as a stakeholder.

Peer to peer failed.
Insurance says it is not medically necessary.
They appeal.
They say no again.
They go to third party appeal.
They submit all the pertinent medical research supporting the need for the procedure.
They even included the second opinion of a different surgeon outside of their program - he recommended the procedure.
24 hours later, they hit them back with the final " No.
Not medically necessary.
His surgeon goes crazy and is like "Fine.
But he would tell her which procedure he would recommend, because he didn't know another one that would help the poor child.
Of course, they don't..
And this kid is screwed.
There is no other option.
As it turns out, this procedure is generally hated by insurance because it is very expensive.
They always have to fight for it, but they usually agree after an appeal.

I told you so.
The grocery store he worked at was undergoing a complete and total reorganization.
The aisles were changing, and everyone was learning where everything was.
Needless to say, it was chaos.
At the time this happened, they were pretty busy and he had a line of customers,, but Karen decided to skip the line to ask him where something was.
I don't remember the exact item, but it was something like paper plates (or something that would be near them, plastic forks.
straws.
Since he had a line of customers, he couldn't leave to help her locate, so he told her " he believes they are now on aisle 7 " .
Before he can even get on his walkie to ask someone for sure, she storms off.
Only to come storming back a couple of minutes later to tell him they are not there.
A manager is now nearby,, so he asks him if he can help her, and he tells him that he thought they were on 7, but she said they were not.
He looks confused and says "OK, maybe they are on 8.
I'll help her find them, ma'am.
As they are about to walk away, she turns to him and says "He should know better than to tell someone where something is if he doesn't actually know ".
Long story short, she comes back to the checkout, but goes to another line.
As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to him " They were on aisle 7, like he told her. "
HA told him so.
The planet Jupiter finally left the solar system of the office.
He wrote some years ago about his office nemesis, a woman called Planet Jupiter in his stories.
There is not much to say here.
The last time he saw her before Corona, she had lost some weight and seemed to be paying a bit of attention to food groups when she ate lunch, though she was still using her power wheelchair and being a bit smelly.
He asked how she was, like he asks all his co--workers when he sees them.
"Not so good, OP, he found out he has diabetes, so he has to eat fewer carbs. "
To her slight credit, the lunch had cauliflower rice instead of regular.
He is from the Midwest and has always been nice to PJ's face,, so he told her he was sorry, that sucked, about this project they are both on.
She also works late to get it done for the court deadline.
"Yes, OP.
He is saving money to move.
This is really rare.
My state has the lowest outmigration of any state, ever.
Where she is moving.
To another Midwest city that works a lot in the beef industry.
I hope they didn't mistake her for a steer.
It turns out that she and others documenting all her slow and bad work, falling asleep at the desk, annoying others and smelling, has caused her to lose out on positions with all but one of the companies that often hire her, her and others for contract work.
So she has to move to where her family is in that city..
She'll go blight another workplace, but at least not mine.
It's not that important now, because he got a much better remote position.
Hey r / Military.
He is from a country where military duty is mandatory and he is just wondering how it is for other countries.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that a woman has been elected to the presidency of the United States.
He is from Estonia, where he is part of the National Defense Force.
There is mandatory military service for all men between the ages of 16 and 29.
He has to complete 8 or 11 months of training after which he is sent to the " reserve " unit until he turns 60.
In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand them to take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year.
However, they are not mandated to go on a foreign mission.
If he wants to do that, he has to join the " scouts battalion " where he will be a professional military man with pay and such.
He is just wondering how it is for other countries..
If they join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, they are mandated to go fight in another country.
What the guys think about mandatory military service.
During training when he was in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada.
Unfortunately though, they didn 't have much time to socialize and he didn 't get to ask those guys in person what it 's like for them to serve in their country 's military.
He knows that there are probably mostly NATO members in this subreddit, that it would be interesting to hear from other ( non- NATO ) countries as well.
I apologize for his poor grammar.
German is his second language.

He knows that having a credit does not make the food experience better, but allows him to compensate for the delay..
Liz Truss pledges another £75 million in aid to Afghanistan at the G7 meeting.
A further £75 million in aid is to be given to Afghanistan by the UK to help address its worsening humanitarian situation, Liz Truss has announced.
The Foreign Secretary said the commitment would help save lives and " support stability in the region "
It follows discussions among G7 foreign ministers in Liverpool on Saturday about what coordinated action can be taken in Afghanistan, along with how to engage with the Taliban rulers.
The militant group stormed Kabul in a lightning advance in August, as 20 years of occupation of the central Asian country was brought to a close with a hurried allied withdrawal.
Ms Truss said: "The UK is providing vital humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan this winter.
The funds announced today will save lives, protect women and girls and support stability in the region.
They are determined to do all they can for the people of Afghanistan.
The additional financial support will bring the UK 's commitment to Afghanistan to £286 million this year.
It will be used to provide support for victims of gender- based violence and to fund essential child protection services.
The United Nations and aid agencies will prioritise those most at risk including households headed by women and disabled people, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said.
Officials said no funding would go directly through the Taliban, instead being funnelled through the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, World Food Programme ( WFP ) and other organisations.
The WFP will receive £34 million of the funding announced on Sunday.
David Beasley, the organisation's executive director, said the donation would " help them save many lives "
The situation on the ground is heart- breaking - 23 million people are facing severe hunger in a country crippled by drought, conflict and an economic crisis.
" Women and children are bearing the brunt of this suffering and, as the harsh winter descends, more and more are slipping into malnutrition and starvation each day "
This week the UN 's humanitarian chief warned that Afghanistan 's economic collapse was " happening before their eyes " and urged the international community to take action to stop " the freefall " before it leads to more deaths.
Martin Griffiths said "It is getting more and more dire by the week "
The funding announcement comes after ministers this week faced awkward questions about the Afghan withdrawal effort following a whistleblower's evidence to MPs.
Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during Operation Pitting, claimed just 5% of Afghan nationals who applied to flee under one UK scheme received help as a result of the " dysfunctional " and " chaotic " handling of the situation.
Mr Marshall told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that some of those hoping to escape were murdered after being left behind in Kabul.
He also claimed Boris Johnson requested that " considerable capacity " was made available to evacuate animals from a shelter run by former Royal Marine Paul "Penn " Farthing, putting the lives of troops at risk to help aid their departure on a privately funded plane.
The Prime Minister has called the claims " complete nonsense.
At the Museum of Liverpool on Sunday, Ms Truss will have discussions with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who are attending the G7 gathering for the first time - most of them virtually.
The Foreign Secretary will stress the importance of working with south--east Asia's " economies of the future " to tackle the current challenges facing the West, the FCDO said.
The invitation to Asian ministers comes after the UK 's integrated review on foreign policy announced in March a " tilt " towards the Indo-- Pacific, in a move seen as aiming to counter China 's growing influence in the region.

If you are intent on finding comic book perfection, or CGC guaranteed results, it would probably be best to view the comics in person at their store before bidding.
The Dallas Cowboys bring benches to Washington, the rivalry heats up.
The visiting sideline at Washington has a familiar home look for the Dallas Cowboys.
After getting word from other teams that the sideline benches at FedEx Field were in major need of an upgrade, the Cowboys brought their own for this showdown game.
When they arrived at the stadium on Sunday, they were already decked out in Cowboys logos and wordmarks.
The Cowboys heard from the Seahawks, who recently played against Washington on a Monday night and had complaints that the heated benches were malfunctioning.
Earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, because of the heated benches are beneficial to his knee injury.
The Cowboys just made sure that Zeke and his teammates got that opportunity..
This move is just the latest twist in the Dallas- Washington rivalry, one that got juiced up even more this week when Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy predicted a win for his team, prompting some fireworks back and forth with Washington 's Ron Rivera and players.
Washington has beaten the Cowboys in consecutive matchups.
It has been more than 30 years since it has defeated Dallas in three straight meetings (1986-88 .
Cowboys fans made up more than half of the crowd at FedEx field, which was evident based on the blue and white jerseys in the stands.
Owner Jerry Jones foreshadowed that earlier this week when he said on 105.3 FM in Dallas, " We have always sold more Cowboys ' hats, caps and T--shirts.
They 've always had their greatest fan support coming from Washington, that 's outside the Dallas area.
Outside the Texas area, Washington is where they have the most support of all when it comes to all the things they might count.
It is necessary to use the " add to the basket " function to combine the order, then check out and pay as usual.
Then, they will refund the excess shipping when they dispatch.
If they want to know in advance what the shipping would be, they send a message stating which items and sizes they would like and the country they are to be shipped to.
Q. he can send the order to a different address.
If they are in the UK, they have no problem sending to a different UK address but they must have picked an item that has signed for delivery as its default shipping, or have picked the signed for delivery option when they placed the order.
For international orders, they cannot change the address.
If there is a mistake, they will be informed as soon as possible so that they can cancel the order and re-purchase with the correct address.
Q. he can have the measurements of an item.
A. He should check both the description of the listing and the pictures in the listing.
Whenever possible, they attempt to put up a size guide.
If they can't find a size guide, they will contact them.
Q. How the clothing compares to his country's sizes.
Unless stated otherwise, all items were designed for the UK market.
If they are in North America, the sizing in the UK is slightly smaller so they may need to go up one size.
For further guidance, size charts are available.
Normally, the UK sizes are the same as the EU sizes and shouldn't need to be altered.
When the order arrives.
For the UK, they send almost all orders via Royal Mail 1st Class.
This has a 1-3 day delivery estimate.
If they require a next day delivery, they also offer a Royal Mail Special Delivery 1pm service.
For Europe, most orders take between 3-5 days to arrive in the country and for the rest of the world 5-7 days.
After that, it is not possible to give an estimate on delivery times as it depends on the individual country's postal service and customs if outside of the EU.
Q. I can exchange for a different size or item.
Yes, there are two ways this can be done.
1st, they contacted them asking for a return address.
When sending the item back, they must include a note stating their eBay ID and the size they require.
If he placed an international order, half of the shipping fee originally charged would be applied again.
2) Use the eBay option to return an item.
This option is also suitable if they would like a refund, as once they have received the item back, they would be refunded. If they need an exchange, they would have to purchase the correct item either before or after the refund.
It is necessary to use the " add to basket " function so that the order stays together.
If items are ordered individually, it is not guaranteed that they will be shipped together.
Once all items are in the shopping basket, they are checked out and paid as usual, and the excess shipping is refunded.
If he hasn't received his refund after he has marked an item as dispatched, he should send him a message so that the refund can be processed.
Q. they include a receipt.
No, they do not include receipts in packages unless requested.
If they require a receipt, they can send a message and they can have one emailed over.
If they require a VAT receipt, they can contact them and they can send one over.
He has been waiting a while for his order and it has not arrived.
It is possible that it is lost.
For orders going to the UK, the order will take 7 days to arrive, Europe 21 days and the rest of the world 30 days.
If the order has not arrived after these dates, they should contact the company to investigate with the delivery agent.
This can take up to 2 weeks,, but as soon as they have an update, they will let them know.
Q. he is from outside the EU.
I have to pay no duties or customs.
He should check this information with local authorities.
They do not accept responsibility for customs or duty charges, they will not pay any money towards them.
They do not alter information on customs declarations so they do not ask.
He thanks them for their custom.
They are a small business based in the Isle of Man, and if they have any enquires about their order or any questions, they should not hesitate to ask them.
They will try to get back to them as soon as possible, but it may take up to 24 hours.
If he hasn't received a response after this time, he must send the message again in case he has overlooked it or on the rare occasion when there is a problem with the eBay messages.
The order is extremely late and it shows here that the rider is already at the restaurant..
However, it is strange because there is no progress at all.
In this case, he has marked his order as delivered and will process his refund.
So that they can place a new order instead..

When tornadoes get that imminent, the weather guys usually do that " Take cover now. "
thing because we don't know if it will be in two minutes or ten minutes or what.
I don't know what right they have to actually forbid people to leave,, but I could see where they would be telling them to take cover.
I can't imagine all those people trying to get out of the parking lot when it touched down.
They would all have been killed.
But if they were like "Keep working.
instead of " Take Shelter "
that's different.
No one knows if they were still working or if they were sheltering in there somewhere.
Incredible.
But good on him.
When he was 16, he applied and was offered a job at a restaurant.
Dishwasher.
First shift they had him close.
Saturday.
They were working till past 1am.
He quit the next day.
The best way to lose a new young worker is to shock them with that.
The same thing happened to his friend after he had been working with Pizza Hut for a couple years ( didn't make him close until months after he started working and trained up ) and got him a job there on the spot.
They proceeded to put him on two closes in a row..
He quit.
Unless they advertise a job as a closing gig late at night, expect to lose their workers if they hit them with it too early.
Decoupling will need them to make sure their apps work on all different versions of iOS.
This is not necessarily true.
Just put a cap on the versions of iOS that the app supports and only push out updates for devices with the latest compatible versions of iOS.
That's how most apps work now..
Also, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions frequently.
The problem is that it is still not frequently enough.
It also makes for some terrible UX.
Even though Apple increased the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, the user still needs to perform a full OS upgrade every time.
and that the developers are confident that their patch or feature will be included in the new release.
= This is in contrast to Google.
Google had to disconnect because there were a lot of Android versions in the wild, each with a huge market share.
I can say without a doubt that if the Android versions on the phones were consistent with the releases of the games on the OS, then it would not have been possible for Google to release the games on the OS.
That 's a bold claim,, but either way it still doesn 't explain how bundling app updates as OS updates is " better " for the developers or the end user.
Apple Music Documents and Data Storage Size
Recently, he made the switch from an iPhone 12 Pro to a 13 Pro Max, and on both iphones he noticed a bug that is eating up his internal storage.
Apple Music's Documents and Data are using about 35 GB of internal storage.
He has tried to remediate this by deleting the app, but since this is a stock app, the documents and data are never truly deleted from the iPhone.
He thought that once he moved to the new iPhone 13 Pro that the bug would disappear,, but that was not the case.
After installing from an iCloud backup, he checked the Apple Music app and it was still using more than 30GBs for documents and data.
After contacting two Apple Support specialists, one suggested that he wipe his iPhone and start fresh, while another didn't offer any real suggestions as the issue goes beyond anything they can do.
He also checked his iPad and it seems that AM is only using 15GBs for documents and data on it, but that still is not acceptable.
Now he is turning to the community to see how widespread this issue is, and maybe get Apple's attention on this issue.
He has experienced this as well..
He is really sorry for the inconveniences, he can respond to his email and he will gladly continue assisting him personally or he can start a new interaction with them as he wishes, he is happy to help him.

South Africa pays tribute to the last apartheid leader de Klerk.
South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy.
De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer.
Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor.
He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa 's transition from white minority rule to the first multiracial elections in 1994.
De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990.
Mandela then became South Africa 's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election.
President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town 's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa 's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk 's honor.
"He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness "De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees.
He will never forget this man who mesmerized him, who made him want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him.
A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers.
Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions.
Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid- era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer.
De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid 's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa 's non-white majority.
Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying " Justice denied " and " Justice for apartheid victims " and were quickly led away by police.
The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security.
Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk 's image amid criticism for his failure to officially apologize for the crimes of apartheid.
In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing.
De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing " for the pain, hurt and indignity that apartheid has done " to South Africa 's non-white populations.
He enjoys articles like this that help untangle the convoluted web of sociopathic megalomaniac men that his father glorified ad nauseam and the plurality of leaders he decried.
Guess where Nixon and Carter fell, and his golden boy Reagan could do no ills.
While he has long since known that this world view is complete BS and in fact he despises each of those megalomaniacs from Caesar through Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Trump,
I can appreciate the historical significance of Caesar or Napoleon, but the quasi- sacred nature of their sanitized histories turned him off them later on in life.
To this day, he still refuses to study the history of Poland because that would allow the paranoid conspiracies of his father to bubble forward..
Returning to this article, he loves the small details that remind him that there actually was one good choice ( despite smaller flaws - but mostly acting in good faith ) and one side that was not good, did not act in good faith and where malice was and is the more likely explanation than stupidity.
That's the thing.
Republicans love to hide behind stupidity rather than admit malice, but make no mistake if the ideological basis of a party is being under siege.
Then coincidence, serendipity rarely exist.
The besieged mentality means that every action must count, or else they are expending limited energy on frivolous acts.
But Republicans love to hide behind their more nuanced understanding of the world and try to throw back the various philosophical razors.
France reacts to the rival offer of US frigates to Greece.
The defense ministries of France and Greece have both confirmed that a competing offer from the US will have no impact on an already "signed " and " final " multibillion deal to purchase French Belharra frigates.
France's Ministry of Armed Forces stated on Saturday that a defense contract with Athens had already been "initialled a few days ago " before the US State Department announced its approval of a potential sale of American frigates.
Since the discussions with the Greeks began, the American offer is no longer on the table.
They also signed the contract with the Greeks..
Greece's Defense Ministry also confirmed that the deal with Paris was " final " since it had been negotiated at the " highest level possible " and " personally announced " by the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
The finalized contracts are allegedly expected to be ratified by the Greek Parliament " soon.
The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday it had approved the sale for $69 million of four Lockheed Martin combat frigates, and a separate $25 million program to upgrade Greece 's Meko class frigates.
The announcement triggered some concerns over the Athens- Paris agreement, especially after a long- existing submarine construction " deal of the century " between France and Australia was abruptly tanked by a bombshell AUKus pact in September without any prior warning.
Outraged Paris accused Washington and Canberra of a "stab in the back " while just two weeks later Macron took the stage with the Greek PM to personally announce the sale of at least three French warships to Athens for around $35 million, saying it was time to " stop being naive " while touting the new deal as a sign of " Europe 's strategic autonomy and sovereignty " .
This time around, according to the French military, the US " had warned them that this announcement was going to come out " and that Americans allegedly had " no inclination to go further " with an actual sale of their frigates.
The rider assigned never showed up..
He has been removed from the roster and the system is now looking for a new rider..
Kindly give it 15 more minutes to get there.
He tried to call the restaurant and the rider, but they were not able to respond. he apologised.
I can find out if he is still willing to wait for the order.
They had power go out a couple of times.
Step 1 is to get someone on the door immediately.
They are security now.
Don't let anyone in and pay attention to people as they leave (esp kids ' hands.
Step 2 is to call the store manager if they are not there.
Step 3 is that those at the tills and everyone else are free to wait a couple minutes to see if backup generators can get them going again.
Step 4 is to go throughout the store and get every non employee to leave.
As well as every cart brought to the front.
Step 5 is to go through the carts looking for anything cold and produce.
Step 6 is to return the cold produce.
Step 7 is to cover all non- doored cold, i.e. cheese, meat, vegetables.
Step 8 was to sign their names on a sheet of paper as they left to be clocked out.
(Some were allowed to leave earlier, especially if they were uncomfortable in the dark or still had 6 hours to go. )
It's really dark, even upfront.
There is no way to let customers just hang out..
It is not clear why some tills still had some power while others did not.
Not sure, but they didn't have any way of paying them..
I think that the items would scan, but they would not trust the customers to pay later.
One time it took only like 3 hours for power to go back on.
They had a few of us stay so if it did, as they were told by the power company it should, they could reopen.
He does not mind, as long as they have the choice to stay or not, helping to preserve the product as best as they could.
Not having a choice, as well as endangering passengers, is where he draws the line..
When it comes to buying quality gear, a sleeping bag needs to be first on the list.
It is possible to cut back on all manner of equipment, but not on a sleeping bag.
A lot of their time when out camping or expeditions is spent in their sleeping and with Snugpak they are assured quality.
A tried and tested favourite, this British made sleeping bag combines micro pack size with serious performance.
Many view the Softie 12 Osprey as the ultimate four season synthetic fill sleeping bag available.
Since 1987, it has been setting the standard for winter pack size performance for others to follow.
Those who know about the Softie 12 Osprey have either used one or wished they had one.
Used from the heights of the Scottish mountains to the bottom of their snow hole.
The Softie 12 Osprey, like many of the other sleeping bags in the Softie Original Series, have been assigned a NATO Stock Number.
The quilted top of the bag is tailored, pleated, and fitted with a drawcord so it pulls into shape, rather like a jacket hood.
To prevent the 2-way zip from snagging either the zip baffle or the bag edges, an " anti- snag strip " of webbing is sewn in behind the zip.
Liner Fastening and Hanging Tabs Inner tabs are provided to keep a loose liner in position, corresponding in position with the tabs they provide on their liners.
External tabs allow the bag to be easily hung for airing and drying..
Tapering the bag to a circle foot creates the " mummy " shape which is easy to warm and minimises the weight of material used.
Hard to see in the picture, but a zip baffle runs the full length of the bag, behind the zip, to prevent heat escaping through the zip area.
Buy a left and a right hand to make a double ( please check when ordering )
It comes complete with a compression stuff sack to make the bag smaller when not in use.
It can be used with the Snugpak Exanda Panel to make a wider sleeping bag for more comfort.
This sleeping bag can be made extra long.
A single--layered sleeping bag with one layer of softie insulation.
Snugpak are based in a listed mill built in the 1800s on the edge of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales.
They are very proud to be one of the last manufacturers of quality sleeping bags and insulated clothing not only in the UK but across Europe.
They have a dedicated workforce at their West Yorkshire factory in the North of England who are trained to use state-of the art machinery and traditional sewing techniques to bring their ideas to life.
Contact Left Limited is an official supplier for Snugpak and carries a large range of their kit in their EBAY shop.

The shuttle bays of the Enterprise D.
The " Enterprise D " of " The Next Generation " had three shuttle bays.
On the show, they always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13.
These two shuttlebays were represented by a full- size studio set that could house full size shuttlecraft sets.
He always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the midsection, neck, or whatever you want to call it.
Since they never saw the main shuttlebay.
It was located below the main bridge on decks 3 and 4 and would presumably be a massive facility.
Instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it all the way down to deck 13.
In the original Star Trek, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life.
Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life.
They could not have done this on TNG.
We saw Worf and Data launch a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in " The Best of Both Worlds, Part II " but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle.
They simply see the wall outside the window as the shuttle flies out, quickly replaced by space.
The only time they saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in " Cause and Effect " .
We see a space shot of the roll door opening, decompressing the main shuttlebay, and they get a quick glimpse of inside along with a few parked shuttles.
Any ideas as to why the main shuttlebay was never seen outside these two instances.
Heavy snowfall wreaks havoc in Serbia and much of Balkans
Heavy snowfall wreaked havoc in much of the Balkans on Sunday, disrupting public transportation.
Flights were cancelled at Serbia 's main airport in Belgrade on Sunday and many areas reported power cuts and damage to buildings.
Much of western Serbia was without electricity as authorities warned against unnecessary travel and appealed to people in Serbia to conserve power.
There was some damage to cars and buildings in Belgrade due to the snow.
Several flights from and to Belgrade 's main airport were cancelled because of the weather conditions and a brief power cut to the main terminal, Belgrade media reported.
A highway leading to the airport was closed for several hours because of a traffic jam caused by the snowfall.
Passengers on a local train to Belgrade were stuck in snow for seven hours before they were provided bus transportation to the capital.
Emergency services have been assisting authorities in the cleanup operation, while another alert for more snow and ice has been issued.
Meanwhile, in Bulgaria, heavy rains and major floods have ravaged southern parts of the country over the weekend, forcing authorities there to declare a state of emergency.
The worst affected areas were in the Smolyan region near the border with Greece, where rivers burst their banks to cause the overflowing of roads and the flooding of homes.
Several trucks were trapped in a landslide on an intercity road.
Strong winds disrupted power supply in dozens of villages, authorities said.
Further south in Albania, authorities mobilised police, army and emergency forces to cope with floods following three days of continuous rainfall and snow.
The Vjosa River in the south flooded many areas.
An older couple who had stayed overnight on the roof of their house in southwest Albania was rescued by police in the morning.
Many roads were temporarily blocked by landslides in the south.
Elsewhere in the northeast and southeast of the country, heavy snow has hampered or temporarily blocked traffic.
This year's trend for a second Christmas tree in the bedroom sends sales of smaller spruces soaring.
He only had one Christmas tree.
Then he could be behind the times.
This year's trend is for a second tree in the bedroom, and it has sent sales of smaller spruces soaring.
More than a quarter of British homes now boast two festive firs, experts say - and it could be more than a status symbol.
The soothing green colour and the pine aroma are said to be good for mental health and sleep cycles – while even fake trees can help evoke a feeling of nostalgia.
Other families get two trees so children can decorate one as gaudily as they like, providing a place for any home-ade masterpieces, while leaving a more elegantly garlanded fir on more prominent display to impress the neighbours.
Among those buying into the trend, which started in the US, are Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, who gets a second tree for grandchildren George, Louis and Charlotte at her home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire.
Last week, she posted on Instagram: " Once again this year, she plans to have two Christmas trees: one for the children to decorate and one which she does herself. "
The British Garden Centres said sales of smaller trees are up 50 per cent this year across its 58 sites.
Director Boyd Douglas-Davies, who is also president of the Horticulture Trades Association, said: "People are trading up from a plant in the bedroom and putting in beautifully decorated trees.
Fellow garden centre chain Squire 's reports that 30 per cent of their customers plan on having at least two trees - and more than one in ten intend to have three or more.
Chairman Sarah Squire said: "They give a bedroom a lovely, calming scent that is the perfect aid for a good night 's sleep. "
Just as bedroom plants have been known to help mental health and purify the air, trees are also said to aid slumber.
Sleep expert Carl Walsh said: " Their brains collect information from their surroundings and this translates into signals releasing hormones in response.
In this case, melatonin and cortisol are the hormones that control the sleep cycle and put the body into a sleepy state.
He added that a bedroom tree could also transport people back to a more carefree and youthful era.
"Christmas can be a pretty stressful time.
A bedroom tree takes people back to their childhood when they had no responsibilities and can forget about stressful things.
It is always good for sleep.

Iowa Santa retires after 50 years.
An Iowa Santa who has been making children smile for 50 years says he is ready to hang up the red suit and enjoy a quieter Christmas.
Dave Stoufer revealed health issues and age- related issues had led to his decision to retire from the " longest job " he had ever had.
His wife Rachel Nicola said while she was very proud of the work her husband had done to bring joy to so many people, she was looking forward to having more time to celebrate Christmas with him.
For his information, he would send him a transcript of their conversation.
If he has any further questions or concerns, he can always reply back to that email and they will be able to help him further.
The guys all have guns.
Even babies.
Everyone walks around with them like it's the Wild West.
I don't even know where to begin here.
I honestly think that a crackhead would own an expensive gun and then save up enough money for ammunition.
A crack head is not a "professional mugger.
If there are no reports of people being stabbed, it doesn't matter.
Stabbings don't get the same press treatment as shootings.
Just because the press does not highlight something does not mean that it is not happening.
WTF this has to do with race.
This stuff withers when exposed to any critical thought.
He is not going to rule out that there are vast swaths of people who do not practice critical thinking,, but either way, proving it wrong is no guarantee that it will wither.
In the end, they 've already had a forensic audit and a hand recount of these votes, and that didn 't help.
They should just keep allowing them to " audit " votes until they get the results they want.
This is letting Uri Geller try and pull his shit on James Randi.
This is where the story ends and the lie goes to die.
No, it is not..
This is Uri Geller trying to pull his shit on James Randi, not liking the results, and hiring a company whose CEo has claimed he believes Geller's powers are real to "study " his powers and investigate whether Randi is a Communist who 's trying to ruin Geller.
If there are no results produced here, they ask for another audit.
Or they claim that shredded ballots were fed to chickens that were then incinerated.
At some point, they have to do the actual work of looking at reality and comparing it to what they think and point out where they are wrong.
They've already done this.
Twice.
It hasn't stopped them..
And it is not harmless..
There are already allegations that these people are breaking federal law by not properly sealing ballots.
Also mentioned in that article is that this company plans to physically canvas parts of Maricopa county to ask people if their ballots match.
How comfortable he would be if someone showed up to ask him who he voted for in the last election, knowing that if he doesn't tell them, his vote might be flagged and discarded.
How sure they are that this company is going to keep the data private and not let others in their community know.
And he would be as likely to vote if he knew that this was a possibility every time.
I know plenty of people who would not.
He was buying new tires..
He found the ones he wanted on a tire store website.
He printed out the page and took it to his local shop..
It was part of a chain.
The guy at the shop checked things out and it turns out that the current price of the tires was more than his printout.
Don't know where he got the higher price from.
Luckily, the guy was honest and rather than trying to charge the higher price, he sold him the tires for the price he had on his printout.
He said that because he had the printout, he had to sell him the tires at the printout price.
He was gracious about it too.
They have been buying tires from them ever since..
Russia warned of " consequences " if Ukraine attacked.
The Group of Seven has warned Russia of massive consequences and severe costs if President Vladimir Putin attacks Ukraine, according to a draft statement.
US intelligence estimates that Russia could be planning a multi-- front offensive on Ukraine as early as next year, involving up to 175,000 troops.
The Kremlin denies it plans to invade and says the West is gripped by Russophobia.
Moscow says the expansion of NATO threatens Russia and has contravened assurances given to it as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
At a meeting in the northern English city Liverpool, the G7 delegates said they were united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up near Ukraine and they called on Moscow to deescalate.
"Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost " the draft statement said, confirmed by G7 sources.
"They reaffirm their unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future " the draft said.
For Moscow, the growing NATO embrace of a neighbouring former Soviet republic - and what it sees as the nightmare possibility of alliance missiles in Ukraine targeted against Russia – is a " red line " it will not allow to be crossed.
Mr Putin has demanded legally binding security guarantees that NATO will not expand further east or place its weapons close to Russian territory; Washington has repeatedly said no country can veto Ukraine 's NATO hopes.
In 2014, Russia seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine, prompting the West to slap sanctions on Russia.
The Kremlin said today that Mr Putin told US President Joe Biden that Russian troops posed no threat and that Moscow was being demonised for moving troops around its own territory.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were very serious conceptual differences between Russia and the United States on Moscow 's " red lines.
The G7 consists of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States, and includes a representative from the European Union.
"We call on Russia to deescalate, pursue diplomatic channels and abide by its international commitments on transparency of military activities " the G7 said in the draft.
"They reconfirm their support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy Format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. "
China 's Xi and Russia 's Putin dominate the G7.
The Pope calls for " serious international dialogue " to defuse the tensions in Ukraine.
Pope Francis, in his first comments on the tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, today called for serious international dialogue to resolve tensions and urged both sides to avoid an armed conflict.
He said he was praying for " dear Ukraine, for all its churches and religious communities and for all of its people, so that tensions there are resolved through a serious international dialogue and not with weapons "
Weapons are not the path to take.
May this Christmas bring peace to Ukraine " the pope told thousands of people in St. Peter's Square for his noon blessing and address.
Ukraine is predominantly Orthodox Christian, with Catholics of either the Latin Rite or Byzantine rite making up about 10 % of the population in the former Soviet republic.
Separately, Mr Biden has said he told Mr Putin that Russia would pay " a terrible price " and face devastating economic consequences if it invaded Ukraine.

He understood what Dave was trying to say.
It's worse to kill black people than it is to make fun of trans people.
And of course, that is true.
But Dave forgot something.
Many people who hate trans people also hate black people.
He hasn't endeared anyone to #blacklivesmatter.
He's just given transphobes another hero and more anti- trans rhetoric.
He has given credibility to transphobia.
And considering the most vulnerable trans people are trans women of colour, he has made them a target for violence.
He left his show because he realized that white people were laughing at him, not with him.
That he did not realize that he had done the same thing to trans people is very sad.

Time is running out for the Iran nuclear deal, Germany says.
Germany's foreign minister warned on Saturday that time was running out to find a way to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries.
Talks have resumed in Vienna to try to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to gauge the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations.
"Time is running out " German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Liverpool, England where G7 foreign ministers are meeting.
It has shown in the last days that there has been no progress.
Baerbock said Iran had resumed the talks with a position that set the negotiations back six months.
The current round of talks in Vienna follow a pause of five months after the election of a hardline anti- Westerner as Iran 's president, Ebrahim Raisi.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a " productive " meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks.
A senior State Department official said there was an " intense " conversation among the G7 countries, which were united in their position on the nuclear talks.
"The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it is possible to conclude a deal but that the time is shrinking, so they are united in that " the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said.
The official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks.
Iranian officials have previously said they were sticking to their tough stance.
Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned in 2018 by then- President Donald Trump, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions.
The West fears the program would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies.
Raisi said on Saturday that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks in Vienna, the official IRNA news agency reported.
The indirect US- Iranian talks, in which diplomats from France, Britain, Germany and China shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume full compliance with the agreement.
The G7 meeting which is expected to result in a joint call for Iran to moderate its nuclear program and grasp the opportunity of the Vienna talks.

French fishermen threaten to disrupt British imports in post- Brexit fishing row.
French fishermen have threatened to disrupt British imports in an attempt to press London for more licenses as tensions escalate between France and the UK over post- Brexit fishing rights.
The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months.
France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses needed for its boats to operate in British and Channel Island waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year.
The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough.
Underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses, a group representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur-- Mer and others along the northern coast threatened late on Saturday to launch protests.
"Protests are expected " the local CRPMEm fishing industry group for the Hauts de France region said in a statement.
The group said its members were " exasperated " by the news of only 23 new licenses and felt " betrayed " by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against Britain over the issue.
The CRPMEm said the protests would be " in line with blockades of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the north of France which took place on November 26 "
On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint- Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link.
Several rounds of talks between the two sides have since been held but a durable solution has yet to be worked out.

He hasn't seen any comments from Australians yet, so he might as well say a few words.
It is difficult to find equipment that is unique or out of the mainstream.
Most boards are mass market boards such as sector 9s or Loaded Tan Tien 's . He has both and he likes them.
If he wants something out of the ordinary, however, he buys it directly from the manufacturer or through Muir.
Shipping is always a problem and it is always expensive.
He really wanted the Tortuga but when it was all priced up, it was over AU$500 ( including shipping and exchange rate ) .
Shipping alone was approx. US$100.
He understands that this is not something he has control over. he only wanted to illustrate the considerations and trade-offs made from this side of the world.

This means that when he works out, he does not care about how many calories he burns, and he does not change his numbers or macros because of how many calories he burned.
I try to stick to the 1200-1300.
But if he is extra hungry, yes he will eat something more to fuel his body and accept that weight loss might be a day slower or not.
If they are already doing a 500 calorie cut, an extra piece of steak or even bread after a hard workout is not going to ruin their progress at all.
It might just narrow its deficit that one day.
An extra piece of pizza or bowl of ice cream though..
That's a no go.
If they always need to eat more because of working out, they should not cut so many calories in the first place.
Maybe start with a deficit of 300.
It is hoped that this will help.

This Arab state plans to boost trade with Russia.
The United Arab Emirates plans to increase its trade turnover with Russia to $20 billion in the next five years, the country 's Foreign Trade Minister Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi has announced.
"We are working with the Russian side to increase trade turnover to $20 billion over the next five years and to continue investing in other areas of economic cooperation " Al Zeyoudi told RIA news agency on Saturday during a plenary session of the Expo-2020 international forum in the UAE, which had been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
According to the official, " relations between Abu Dhabi and Moscow are strategic. "
He noted that up to 90% of all Russian investments in the Arab world are made in the UAE.
The UAE also significantly invests in Russia, making up some 80% of all Arab investments in Russia's economy.
"If we are talking about the number of Russian companies in the UAE, it has reached almost 4,000 " Al Zeyoudi stated.
According to the minister, the UAE is already investing in several Russian sectors, including the petrochemical industry, oil and gas, the automotive industry and ports, and it plans to broaden this list.
In 2020, the trade turnover between the two states reached $33 million and in the first 10 months of 2021 its volume exceeded $40 million, reaching a new record, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said last week.
According to the Ministry of Economics, Russia mainly exported mineral products, precious stones and metals to the UAE, while Russian imports from the Arab country included machinery, equipment and vehicles.
Boris Johnson is teetering on the edge of favour with Tory MPs.
Boris Johnson has long been considered a king of comebacks.
And some Tory MPs hope he will continue that streak by managing to rescue himself from plummeting poll ratings in the wake of a string of Downing Street parties in defiance of Covid laws.
The prime minister had tangled himself in knots by repeatedly denying any rules were broken before more reports and evidence emerged to suggest the opposite.
First there was the video of No 10 aides laughing while they discussed a Christmas gathering on 18 December last year.
Then Dominic Cummings, once Johnson's closest adviser, promised pictures had been taken of parties, and so with bated breath critics of the government waited for them to surface.
When an image was published on Sunday showing Johnson on a screen hosting a Christmas quiz for staffers tuning in from No 10 and at home, it was not quite the smoking gun some thought would finally skewer him.
The Sunday Mirror image shows Johnson with two aides who were dressed up with tinsel and a Santa hat - not socially distanced from one another and clearly engaged in a social occasion while mixing households.
But it could have been worse.
There have been other parties hosted in No 10 and Conservative party headquarters in which people drank copious amounts of alcohol, played party games and exchanged secret Santa gifts and socialised into the small hours, sources have told media outlets including the Guardian, Mirror, BBC and Times.
The ministers quietly breathe a sigh of relief, no pictures of these scenes have been leaked - yet.
While Johnson's attendance at the quiz broke the rules, according to Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and a former director of public prosecutions, Tory MPs think people will look at the photo and judge that it really shows him hosting a virtual quiz - a familiar sight during the pandemic.
The staff, dialing in from other rooms in No. 10 while drinking and not socially distancing, cannot be seen.
On Sunday Nadhim Zahawi insisted the picture was just an example of Johnson " thanking his staff " and used it to play down the party scandal as " hype ".
He told LBC: " On that front page, I think his listeners will look at that and see a PM in his office, with the two close people that work with him, with no alcohol, taking 10 to 15 minutes to thank and motivate his staff, who have been coming in because they can't work from home "
A lot of damage has already been done, with mutinous MPs furious at the prime minister allowing a " one rule for them " narrative to take hold, from Cummings to Matt Hancock and more recently Owen Paterson.
Johnson is teetering on the edge of favour with his own MPs; if further photos surface, they may push him over the edge.
Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again.
Risk of power failure inherent in the Gabba 's broadcast compound set-up is unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium 's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.
The primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.
That 's because the precinct 's base power is required to supply the Gabba 's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself .
As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.
However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.
NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.
All other grounds to be used for the Ashes – Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart – will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel powered generator as the back up.
This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.
Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be " huge risks " inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.
The family pays tribute to the " energetic " 18 year old who was stabbed to death in Birmingham.
The family of a teenager who was stabbed to death in Birmingham have described him as a " young, energetic 18 year old " who dreamed of being a digital marketing specialist.
Yahya Sharif was found seriously injured in Coventry Road, Small Heath, just before 5.30pm on Friday, West Midlands Police said.
The police were called to the scene by the ambulance service.
Despite the best efforts of paramedics, Yahya, from Nechells, was confirmed dead at the scene.
A post-mortem revealed he died from a stab wound to the chest.
A statement released on behalf of his family said: " They cannot believe that Yahya has disappeared from their eyes.
They still do not know the reason for his death.
A young, energetic 18 year old, his dream was to be a digital marketing specialist.
The whole community are shocked.
May God be with the family he left behind, especially his parents "
Detectives have been gathering CCTV and other evidence as they try to piece together what happened and identify and trace who stabbed the teenager.
Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse, from the homicide unit, said: "Yahya was just 18 and with his life ahead of him.
This has now been taken away in the most tragic of circumstances.
There is no clear motive for the attack and they are working round the clock to identify and trace who was responsible.
They have spoken to a number of witnesses but they still need to hear from anyone with information who can help them.
I would appeal for those who were there at the time to do the right thing and come and speak to them and tell them exactly what happened and why.
It's the least Yahya 's family deserve.
Anyone with any information should call 101, quoting reference number 3643 10 / 12 / 21.

It was prior to 2018.
He was stranded by US Air in Philadelphia instead of taking him all the way to Newark, and he and a dozen other people were trying to get cars late in the evening.
The counter people were the worst he has ever seen.
A line out the door and they were taking breaks and talking about random non- work related stuff like they were not even there.
He had a confirmed reservation went..
After an hour of waiting, he told her what he had reserved and she loudly accused him of lying to her and told him off.
He finally gave up and walked over to Hertz, who charged him a fortune, but they got him a car right away.
He swore to never use Avis again.
The worst car experience ever..
National and Hertz have always been good experiences for him.
The two of them, followed by Enterprise.
Enterprise was not bad in any way, but they were never as convenient as National, where one could walk up and pick out a car and drive away without waiting forever at a counter.
He knows that these are anecdotal experiences but he goes out of his way to tell everyone to avoid Avis like the plague.
It's true that good customer service will keep customers loyal, and a bad customer experience will drive away 10 times as many more customer opportunities.

Makeshift Munster crush Wasps in Champions Cup cracker
Munster overran Wasps in a thrillingly chaotic Heineken Champions Cup clash contested by makeshift teams besieged by Covid and injury problems.
A rollercoaster first half ended with Munster leading 13-7 after Wasps skipper Brad Shields had been controversially sent off for a dangerous tackle on Dave Kilcoyne.
And with hooker Dan Frost sin-binned on the stroke of half-time, their 13 men were on the ropes and Munster reacted by engineering tries for debutant Patrick Campbell and Andrew Conway.
Alfie Barbeary's all- action display capped by a captivating try had given Wasps hope but he was unexpectedly replaced at half time and it became one way traffic from the moment Campbell showed his class to finish in the 43rd minute.
Missing 17 players to injury, Wasps also had to contend with the loss of four more to Covid in the morning, resulting in a hasty reconfiguration of the team.
Munster, meanwhile, were missing 34 squad personnel because of quarantine following their recent ill-fated United Rugby Championship trip to South Africa, creating five debutants in the starting XV and another seven on the bench.
Crucially, however, Ireland stars such as Tadhg Beirne, Peter O'Mahony, Conor Murray and Keith Earls were present to stiffen their ranks.
For all the absentees, it was an enjoyable spectacle where it appeared at times anything could happen, at least until Munster showed the extraordinary depth of their playing resources to pull clear.
Wasps' Covid-affected start to the day was compounded when play got underway, with Thomas Young denied a certain try by O 'Mahony 's excellent covering tackle.
And while Joey Carbery sent a penalty between the uprights to draw first blood for Munster, Jimmy Gopperth struck the crossbar to continue the two- time champions ' unfortunate opening.
But their scrum was offering a foothold in the game and it took feverish defence to keep their maul at bay until they produced the first of two turnovers in quick succession.
Munster were fighting for every ball in defiance of their absentees and their victory prospects received a dramatic boost when Shields was shown his dubious red card, with referee Romain Poite saying his shoulder had caught Kilcoyne's neck.
Carbery directed a simple penalty at the post and while he was on target soon after, a dramatic twist followed as Wasps plundered a stunning try through Barbeary.
It concluded an exhilarating spell of end- to end rugby in which the rivals took it in turns to attack from deep and, having been at the heart of the home advances, Barbeary delivered the telling blow.
A kind bounce off Murray's kick presented Earls with the simplest of tries as Munster hit back and then Frost departed for the sin bin as the home side were reduced to 13.
It did not take long for the advantage in personnel to be felt as Beirne started a breakout try that ended with fullback Campbell producing a brilliant finish.
And Munster were out of sight in the 49th minute when a loose pass during a promising counter-attack fell for Conway to scoop up and complete a simple run in.
Hooker Scott Buckley, man of the match on his Munster debut, was the next over from a lineout move and that was the game won, although Michael Le Bourgeois picked a quality line to improve Wasps ' final score.

Oh, so glad he asked, he has a lot to say about it.
Yes, there has been a pretty drastic change.
He has been overweight or obese since he was 3 years old, so existing like that is all he has ever known until he was 30 years old.
The vast majority of his family and friends who knew him before treat him the same and are so.
damn.
supportive.
He has a limited number of familial relationships,, which were strained to begin with,, where it seems that his weight loss has exacerbated the existing problems.
This could be the result of their complexes or mine, because I think they are used to being able to shit on him and he, in turn, is now even less willing to take their shit.
One person in particular has, very weirdly, tried to take credit for his weight loss.
Basically, they insinuated that they were the driving force that got her there, under the guise of being supportive, when in reality they didn't even know she was making these changes until she had already gone through with the RNY and lost well over 100lbs.
In fact, they were the last to know, intentionally, because he just didn't want them to try to take control and bully him into things like he used to let them.
Unsurprisingly, now they have taken to insulting his other features, like telling him his nose and forehead look too big since he lost weight and that he needs a nose job and bangs to fix it - this is typical behavior from them.
At first, they just private messaged him these things but when he didn't respond, they took to commenting about it publicly on social media, with no shame.
When he was bigger, that would have destroyed him and he would have listened but now he just ignores it.
Luckily, his skin is thicker now (not just because it is in excess these days.
The attention from strangers is by far the weirdest part for me.
When he was bigger, people didn't pay him any attention.
Like, little to no eye contact.
No saying hello or smiling at him as he passed on the street unless they knew him.
Definitely no going out of their way to help or compliment her.
It was more isolating than he realized because it was what he was used to.
He knew that people could be judgmental of his size, and many did so openly, but he did not realize, until he lost weight, the micro level of it and just how subtle it could be.
In addition to being unaware of it because it is what he is used to, he also does not think that those who perpetuate it are aware that they are doing it.
I really believe it is a subconscious bias, bred and exacerbated by the portrayal and treatment of overweight people in media, that many people just don't realize they project.
Now, it feels like everyone everywhere looks at him, smiles at him and talks to him.
Both men and women engage with him differently, making more efforts to talk to and get to know him - and that is just platonic.
Romantically, his dating pool has expanded from what few were willing to be seen with him to what feels like everyone lol.
It is daunting.
He assumed that, at the very least, the fact that he was morbidly obese, lost all this weight and now has excess skin would deter some people, but despite the fact that he put his weight loss and excess skin right at the forefront ( because he didn't want it to be a secret ), it has bothered or deterred no one in his experience.
It seems to have done the opposite and made them more interested, actually..
A huge shock to him.
I do have to put a little PSA here, though, for men who are newly talking to or dating a woman who has lost weight,, comments like "I am so happy she lost the weight, she clearly hasn't realized how gorgeous she is yet " is not the way to go.
He has heard some variation of this more times than he cares to count and they all thought it was a compliment.
The other thing he can try is to perform a factory reset to his device and then check if it gets detected by his computer.

An Alamo location in California pulled a similar scam on him.
When he returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car ( which he did not cause )
He had to sign to acknowledge the damage.
He also had videos and photos which did not cover the bottom of the car.
A few weeks after he returned home, he received a letter listing a bunch of other damage he would be charged for as well — including scratches to the door which supposedly required repainting the rear of the car a few days after he returned his rental.
None of the damage was visible to him (or the agent when he returned the vehicle.
None of it was visible on the photos he took when he returned the car, so he disputed the claim.
They denied the dispute and demanded immediate payment for the damage.
Since it was a work trip, he turned his photos over to the legal department.
He received a letter from Alamo a short while later saying that they were going to waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction.
If he had been alone, he would certainly have ended up paying the bill for damage which he is certain did not occur while the car was in his care.

Cleaning tip for the hardware of the Android.
Thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm ) dry interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house their smart device microphones and speakers.
They are a cheap product and safer than many other methods, such as rubbing alcohols, tooth picks, pins and needles.
He used this method to clear the microphone port on his Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as it was not registering his voice when using speech to text functions.
After months of thinking, he would need to arrange a warranty replacement or he would need to book a repair.
After much frustration shouting at his watch during phone calls so he could be heard and or understood.
After following manufacturer advice and using the water lock functions, resetting the device and factory restoring his device.
And after scouring the internet on multiple occasions.
There seemed to be no guaranteed satisfaction.
Then he had a revelation and he tried interdental brushes, and they work.
They work very very well.
After a few pokes and twizzles with the thin but firm bristled rod, his device would work just as it did when it was brand new.
He advises this to be done with a dry brush, and will not accept any repercussion if he decides to use it with any combination of any cleaning product.

He has looked into it and he can see that their area is currently having a high volume of orders, that is why they assigned a rider for his order.
But just an update there is now a rider that has confirmed its arrival at the restaurant..
He has done it several times, it does not work.
He issued him a refund for the book.
He is very dissatisfied with the solution, what he will do if the problem occurs again in the next book.
It is a rare occasion that it happens.
He is sorry, due to quality reasons, he will have to close the chat if he does not receive a response in 2 minutes.

We have to bear with him for a moment.
This has been discontinued so will not be returning to stock, they do apologize.
A thief's pants fall down as he attempts to flee.
So to note, he did not witness it.
He was told this by his co--workers at his first retail job.
These two guys came to the store..
One of them was pretty infamous in town for always being in trouble with the law.
After a while of browsing, the infamous one left and went back to his vehicle while the other one took a shopping cart, and put a large 500 dollar socket set in it.
The accomplice then waited until the two cashiers at the exit door were busy, then walked right by them and out the door.
Both of them noticed, and asked each other if the guy paid.
When it was confirmed that he didn't,, one ran after him.
He was told the cashier shouted for him to stop as she chased after him, but he began running with the cart to the getaway vehicle.
I don't know if he was one of those guys who liked wearing his pants low, or he didn't have a belt on.
But he was told his pants started falling down, and he was struggling to pull them up while running and pushing a cart with a heavy socket set.
He then ditched the cart, leaving the socket set in it as he yanked his pants up, and ran to the getaway vehicle, jumping in with his infamous accomplice diving them off.
He has checked there and it appears that the rider went there..
He has checked his doorstep or reception area..
He might have left it there.
Apologies for the inconvenience.
If they cannot find them, they will surely call.
However, it is better that once they are close to their delivery destination, they can be contacted instead.
It was a great day.
Thanks for taking the time to talk to him today.

Free Training on CompTIA A+. Will cover the full course.
He is currently delivering free training on the CompTIA A+ course.
The course consists of 18 modules and he will be doing a dedicated video on each module.
Some of these videos might be a bit long since it will be a whole module in each video so people are free to use the time stamps in descriptions if they are looking for specific topics only or just want to refresh on certain topics only.
The time stamps are there to make life easier for them so it's their own fault if they end up skimming through the module back and forth like a crazy person looking for their lost teeth.
He will make 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4 minute intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between would be his modules.
The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+, and the other courses I delivers should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course.
If he has a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that he would like more clarity on, he is free to ask and he will try to assist him where he can if he is online.
Here is the course introduction.
"CompTIA A+ Course Intro "
How the farewell to Etho was like.
First of a quick disclaimer : he is not the account user but his wife.
He has permission to use this account because he is bad at technology and it helps him with mental health issues ( and he sees the irony of a technophobe asking about the redstone titan )
The second and more important disclaimer is that he does not want to stir drama or suspect something was wrong.
As far as we know, it was just a change of wind that didn't suit everyone..
I'm just an old fan satisfying a nostalgia streak.
With that out of the way, it'.'
I used to be a huge Mindcrack fan back in the day.
Never missed a release from Guude Boulderfist, loved the collaborations, so on.
While watching a random YouTube feed, he came across a vid detailing Etho 's channel history.
Near the end, it touched on the Mindcrack going commercial.
He did not see it in a positive light and the inevitable refusal to sign the related contracts.
Again, neither going " pro " or wanting to keep it casual is a wrong decision and he knows that people go in different directions and such.
A quick Google led him to this old thread which shows his side of things.
Mostly knowing things need to be carefully said, but what strikes most on face value is that they saw things in a different light but overall stayed on good terms.
This whole story happened after he moved on to other things himself,, so it's all kind of new to him.
What he is after is the other side of the picture.
As he said, his mental health is not stellar and seeing an old group he was attached to as a fan parting ways without some dumb explosions that are all too common in the polarized public discourse could be kinda nice and stuff.
However, the response from " the old gang " was good.
He continued to do things together.
They slowly drifted apart.
Still chat or invite one another to events.
Again, I 'm not expecting anything dramatic or to see people at each other 's throats.
It's kind of the opposite.
I guess in a way, a form of low-key closure of something kinda small in his life to reflect a bit of positivity on his own mentally troubled butt.
P.S. I couldn't help but see the charity fund raiser he had and the buttloads he collected.
That's awesome as heck.

A dream to keep all children safe this Christmas
Her brother (nearly two ) had to be persuaded not to walk off with the baby Jesus.
There was the usual gentle chaos that attends any gathering of toddlers.
But everyone was so pleased that it had gone ahead when so many other Christmas events have been cancelled as yet another Covid variant hove into view.
His granddaughter is four, which means that half of her life - half of her life - has been blighted by the pandemic.
Since she became aware, she has known nothing but mask wearing, obsessive hand washing and keeping her distance.
On several occasions ( through various lockdowns ) when he saw her, he didn't know if he should kiss her or not.
What kind of message is sent into the receptive, super-alert brain of a tiny child.
I dread to think.
He says this not as someone opposed to lockdowns or distancing.
For all the criticism of their government, no nation has got it exactly right.
It has been two steps forward and one back ( and sometimes the opposite ) since the beginning of 2020.
And one knew - though many of us during those early sunny months rather enjoyed the luxury of not going out – that all over Britain there were those for whom being at home was hell not heaven.
Children such as Arthur Labinjo-Hughes who became invisible with no school staff to ponder on why he was so thin and ill, no neighbours, no passers-by, no nothing.
The customer gets angry at him because he did not know that he needed help.
He works at a grocery store, picking up and delivering orders..
He often has customers ask where an item is and they ask in the form of a greeting + question, or just a question.
He also has customers who just say hello or good morning.
He passed by a customer who said hello, and he said hello back, then waited a few seconds to see if he had a question.
He didn't say anything else, so he moved on and continued shopping..
He then said " hello " again in a rude tone and asked if he worked there angrily.
He said he did,, and he asked where an item was, again in a rude tone.
He pointed where he believed it would be located and said that he thought it should be there but it looks like they were out of it.
He then just said "forget it " angrily and walked away.
He was supposed to have known he needed help.
He just said " hello " which plenty of customers say to be polite.
This is the only customer he has had who has just said hello without asking a question, then expected him to know he needed help.
He didn't say anything rude to her, but his tone of voice was extremely angry the whole time, even though she tried to help him.
Thank him, he is going to take a moment to look into it for him.
He has apologized for this, as the owner of the account is not himself, he would need # Name # to contact him to confirm his details, once he has done this and has confirmed that he is happy for him to discuss the order with himself, he can then look at the previous correspondence for him.
Joe Biden laments failure to stop global warming after deadly tornadoes.
President Joe Biden lamented the world 's failure to stop global warming on Saturday after addressing the deadly tornadoes that swept through several states.
"We all know that everything is more intense when the climate is warming.
Everything " he said.
"And obviously it has some impact here.
At least 30 tornadoes were reported across six different states causing widespread devastation and over 100 people are expected killed from the storm.
The president said he did not know the full extent of global warming's contribution to the deadly storms, which he described as one of the " largest tornado outbreaks in history. "
He said he would get the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate.
"All that he knows is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet " Biden said.
The president praised the reporter who asked him about climate change.
"As usual, he always asks the best question " he said with a wry chuckle.
"How are they going to handle this " he continued.
Part of it is acknowledging that the likelihood of fewer weather catastrophes, absent of continued movement on dealing with global warming, it's just not going to happen.
Biden said he was shocked by the record wildfires in the country during 2021, expressing alarm that global warming was a major contributor.
"So they have to act " he said.
Biden said the first step was to save lives and care for the families who were affected by the storms.
"I promise him.
Whatever is needed.
Whatever is needed, the federal government is going to supply it " Biden said.
He said he would continue to monitor the storm recovery closely and do whatever was needed by the federal government.
"I want people in all these states to know.
They are going to get through this..
They 're going to get through this together and the federal government is not going to walk away. " he said.
"This is one of those times when they are not Democrats or Republicans. "
The president said he would visit the storm affected areas when it was clear he would not get in the way of local rescue efforts.
"I do plan on going," he said.
From which country they deliver.
When the package is with them.
They have many thanks for their help.
He thanked him for taking the time to talk with him today and he hoped that he had managed to resolve his query, he asked him to rate the chat on his customer service skills, the rating button could be found on the chat.
Aston Villa is the latest Premier League club to suffer a virus outbreak.
Aston Villa have become the latest Premier League outfit to suffer a Covid outbreak, with a number of positive cases discovered at the club.
Sunday's training session at Bodymoor Heath was cancelled as a result, a session that was designed for just a small number of players ' recovery after the loss to Liverpool on Saturday.
It is not thought to be a serious outbreak at this stage, with The Athletic reporting that just one player has tested positive, with the rest being staff at the training ground.
Villa face an away game at Norwich City on Tuesday night in the Premier League and there is no suggestion that it will be cancelled, with training also expected to go ahead as normal on Monday.
The identity of the player who tested positive has not been confirmed, nor whether it was one of the men involved against Liverpool.
Manchester United have also suffered a Covid outbreak on Sunday and there seems to be more concern about that situation, with the Red Devil 's trip to Brentford on Tuesday now reportedly under threat.
Tottenham Hotspur have already been struggling with the virus, with their match against Brighton on Sunday postponed after eight players and five members of staff returned positive results.
Championship sides West Brom and Queens Park Rangers have also suffered outbreaks and QPR 's clash with Sheffield United on Monday has been postponed.
Anyone who tests positive for the omicron variant of Covid-19 will have to isolate for 10 days, as will anyone who has been identified as a close contact of a positive result.
Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5
An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60 year old man and temporarily trapping five others.
The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers ) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss.
The identity of the man who died has not been released, but authorities say he was not breathing after being pulled out of the snow and did not survive despite CPR efforts by another skier.
The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow.
All were wearing avalanche beacons.
While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort.
The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker- Snoqualmie National Forest.
Frank Deberry, the resort 's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort 's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort 's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion.
" Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest.
They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds ( of the resort ) where this slide occurred " Deberry said.
In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour).
The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall.
The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters ) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters ).
"They 've had a late start to the season and now they 've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm.
People got excited "Deberry said.
"Everyone has to remember that it is a sport that carries risk. "
Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in the state of Washington, covering 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares).

His Bought Item will be sent via Royal Mail or a national couriers company.
They try to post the item the same or next working day depending on the purchase time after the payment has been received.
12.00 midday is the cut-off time.
There is no order processing or dispatching on public holidays or weekends.
They dispatch all orders accordingly but at some point, it could be possible that their bought item is out of stock.
In this case, they will notify or contact them either when the item is back in stock ready for them to dispatch or to give them an alternative option.
He would have the right to cancel the order if he wished.
eBay gives an estimated delivery date which does not include any supposed delay by Royal Mail or couriers.
This can include bad weather, system breakdown or staff strikes etc.
These issues are not in their control so they have to keep this in mind..
They dispatch items with the expectation of a service being provided by the couriers, but sometimes they do disappoint and this can't be their fault.
If the courier is unable to deliver, a card should be left by the relevant delivery company instructing how to organise a re-delivery or where the parcel has been left for him to collect.
If the parcel has been returned to the courier's depot, then they will allow a certain time for him to collect.
If it is not collected within this time, the parcel will be returned to them.
They would then require him to repay the postage cost for them to re- send the parcel back to him.
If the item is no longer required, a refund will be issued less the postage amount.
If for any reason he is not satisfied with his purchase, he can return the item for a refund within 30 days.
Returns are accepted only if the item is in its original re-sellable condition, which means items must not be used, worn, marked, have no scent or be in a condition that it can't be sold again.
Items must be returned in their original packaging with all product tags attached.
It is necessary to be careful when clothing is tried on that make up is not worn, or hair products, fragrances, deodorant or other creams or substances which mark or damage the product.
This will only result in their returned item not being accepted by them for a refund..
They will require a postage payment from him for them to return the item to him.
They will keep or await postage payment for the item for a maximum of 30 days, and after this the item will be disposed of.
Items must be returned within 30 days of receipt.
If the item has arrived faulty or they have sent the wrong item, they will pay for the return of the item.
The easiest way would be to open a returns request via eBbay.
Once received, they will examine the item and refund the player's account.
Items becoming faulty after or during wearing will be subject to an inspection of the item when returned to them.
If the fault is considered a genuine factory fault, they will be refunded.
If it is not a factory fault, the item will be returned back to him after the postage cost to return the item has been paid.
Again they would wait 30 days for this payment to be made, after which the item would be disposed of.
The easiest way would be to return the item for a refund via Ebay returns, and then simply purchase the size or colour required back from them.
All returns are the responsibility of the sender until they arrive to the United States.
It is necessary to obtain proof of postage from the Post Office Clerk.
Positive feedback is always appreciated, but if for whatever reason there is a problem with their purchase, they are given the chance to resolve the issue.
It is hoped that their customer service will be very satisfactory.

Checking here again, he can see here that the rider accidentally marked the order as delivered.
They currently do not have the exact information on what happened to the rider as well as to his order.
They are now investigating this for them.
Here's what he can do.
Move the trailer.
Years ago, he worked at a cabinet shop.
He went on an install with the owner and when they came back, the owner parked the empty trailer close to the dumpster.
There was no particular reason for it, he just left it there because there was space.
The next morning he comes into work and Jerry ( not his real name ) comes up to him looking angry about something.
Nothing new, he was always sort of grumpy old fella.
The conversation went something similar to below (18 years ago, so he doesn't remember exactly.
Jerry said that he parked the trailer there by the dumpster.
The owner drove the day before.
Jerry says that he can not park the trailer there, then he can not get to the dumpster.
He didn't park it there, the owner did, but he can move it.
Jerry says he doesn't know why he parked the trailer there.
They know they need to have access to the dumpster.
But I didn't park it there.
Why he doesn't talk to the owner about it.
Jerry says that the kids have no respect, blah blah blah.
It was not me.
The conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him berating him for leaving the trailer in the way that he did not leave in the way.
From that day forward, until he left the cabinet shop a couple years later, any time he worked late ( which was more often than not ) and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, he would pick up the tongue and roll it right up to the dumpster for Jerry to find in the morning.
He would be more than happy to help him.
He will give him a few minutes to verify his information.
In this case what they can try is connecting the device using different USB cords.
Any generic micro-USB cord would work.
Also, they should try using different USB ports in their computer.
Organisations on high alert as techs race to fix software flaw
A critical vulnerability in a widely used software tool – one quickly exploited in the online game Minecraft – is rapidly emerging as a major threat to organizations around the world.
"The internet is on fire right now " said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike.
"People are scrambling to patch " he said, " and all kinds of people scrambling to exploit it "
He said Friday morning that in the 12 hours since the bug's existence was disclosed that it had been " fully weaponized " meaning malefactors had developed and distributed tools to exploit it.
The flaw may be the worst computer vulnerability discovered in years.
It was uncovered in a utility that is ubiquitous in cloud servers and enterprise software used across industry and government.
Unless it is fixed, it grants criminals, spies and programming novices alike easy access to internal networks where they can loot valuable data, plant malware, erase crucial information and much more.
Cyber attacks are now seen as the biggest threat to financial stability.
It would be hard to find a company that is not at risk,, said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Cloudflare, whose online infrastructure protects websites from malicious actors.
Untold millions of servers have it installed, and experts said the fallout would not be known for several days.
Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Tenable, called it "the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade " - and possibly the biggest in the history of modern computing.
The vulnerability, dubbed " Log4Shell " was rated 10 on a scale of one to 10 by the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees development of the software.
Anyone with the exploit can obtain full access to an unpatched computer that uses the software.
Experts said the extreme ease with which the vulnerability lets an attacker access a web server - no password required - is what makes it so dangerous.
New Zealand 's computer emergency response team was among the first to report that the flaw was being " actively exploited in the wild " just hours after it was publicly reported Thursday and a patch released.
The vulnerability, located in open source Apache software used to run websites and other web services, was reported to the foundation on November 24 by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, it said.
It took two weeks to develop and release a fix.

Why Skyler and Walt Jr. were so annoyed with Walt working on the house in season 2.
Specifically 2.10 " Over "
Walt replaces the hot water heater, then replaces boards that were apparently maybe not necessarily rotting.
Why Skyler is so upset about this.
Fed up completely, she says " I'm not even going to work today. "
A week or two prior, she was gung-ho about him resting and recovering the entire time.
He understands that she is unhappy in the relationship, but Walter Jr. is slightly annoyed and completely puzzled by Walt doing some renovations.
He is also aware that Skyler is openly flirting with Ted in the hope that someone treats her as a priority for a change while carrying a child, while Walt has made everything about him ever since his 50th birthday.
Still, it is odd on rewatch that Sky and Jr. seem so incredibly ticked off that Walt is doing something productive at home, not lying or killing people or making drugs.
Just fixing up the house like a homeowner would and should with nothing but spare time.
He also understands this is just another form of desperation to retain his role as husband and family man despite a day or two prior forcing tequila onto his teenage son.
He 's clearly trying to get back in their good graces by hyping up an issue that isn 't an immediate priority to make it seem like he 's done a terrific job and is a terrific person.
He clearly sucks at damage control.
Regardless, the reaction from his wife and son still always rubbed me the wrong way and felt forced in this situation to try and highlight Walt's desperate bid to make up for ugly mistakes.

The dog that would not stop barking and how he got him to stop.
My neighbors got a dog about three years ago.
These neighbors and I share a fence.
It separates their back yards.
Well, this dog snarls and barks and tries to bite him through the fence the entire time he's out in the backyard.
He has tried to ignore it, talk softly, so on.
but this dog is insane.
The maintenance guys are afraid of it.
So he went and did the neighborly thing and asked them to help him figure out how to get this dog to chill.
He can't even use his yard at this point.
That dog is outside all day long, snarling and yapping non-stop.
He asked if he could give it healthy treats through the fence.
The owner says no.
He asked if they could go in halves on a non- shock bark collar.
The owner says no.
( Edit to say I asked the neighbor at least three times to help her dog )
Frustrated but not willing to call animal control or anything yet, he hatched a plan.
He bought a very nice portable speaker that is loud.
Like, he invested and saved in it.
Now, every time he goes to his backyard, he brings his speaker.
There is no daytime noise ordinance here, he checked.
When the dog begins its snarling barking attacking the fence thing, his neighbors ( all of them ) get to enjoy a little Lamb of God or Rotting Christ or some other great music turned all the way up.
His speaker shakes the table.
It didn't take the neighbors long to put two and two together.
The dog is now kept mostly inside and when it does come out, it's quick or the owner goes out with it.
The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet nowadays.
Edit some grammar errors
Edit again PSA do not give dogs any type of human medication, like laxitives or Nyquil.
This can seriously harm and even kill an animal..
Also, the speaker is a portable pa system from Jyx, if anyone is interested.
It was under $200, but he was poor so he had to save for a while.
It sounds great for the money, though..
He is impressed and so are his neighbors.
The plan for the presidential election on 24 December is close to collapse.
The chances of Libya staging its first presidential elections on the long planned date of 24 December appeared close to collapse on Sunday after the body overseeing the vote said it was unable to announce the the approved candidates because of continued legal doubts.
With the elections less than two weeks away and virtually no time for campaigning, a postponement would represent a bitter blow to the international community's hopes of reuniting the deeply divided country.
Foreign powers also fear that the overall momentum towards democracy could dissipate.
In the short term they will have to agree whether or not the interim government continues in order to fill the political vacuum and prevent a return to civil war.
A series of court rulings have overturned the Libyan electoral commission 's decisions to block high- profile figures including Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the former dictator, from standing for the presidency.
The interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and warlord Khalifa Haftar, the head of the self--styled Libyan National Army, have meanwhile been approved by the commission but subsequently appealed by other parties.
It said in a statement on Saturday it said could not announce the names of the approved candidates out of the nearly who 100 have applied because it was "keen to exhaust all means of litigation to ensure its decisions comply with issued judgements.
Rival factions have accused each other of intimidating or bribing judicial officials to secure their reinstatement of their candidates, and the commission is looking to see if the decisions were valid.
In the case of Dbeibah, he had pledged as a condition of becoming interim PM that he would not stand for election but has since argued in court that this was a moral pledge with no legal force.
Saif Gaddafi was convicted in absentia in 2015 on war crimes charges for his part in fighting the revolution that toppled his father, Muammar Gaddafi.
He denies wrongdoing..
The presence of tens of thousands of foreign fighters, mercenaries and indigenous militia make the country a tinderbox, and there are fears an election conducted with disputed candidates would only lead to a result that was not recognized.
In a sign of the tensions over foreign forces, France is pressing the EU to agree on Monday to impose sanctions on the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group, which it says operates in Libya and the Sahel.
Moscow denies Wagner is linked to the Russian state and has said it would retaliate against EU sanctions placed on its citizens.
The international community's ability to demand the Libyan political class stick to the 24 December election date, which was first agreed in February, has been hampered by the appointment of a UN special envoy, Ján Kubiš, who resigned three weeks before the elections after less than a year in the post.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres has since appointed Stephanie Williams, a forceful former UN deputy special envoy to act as his special adviser.
Russia vetoed her appointment as a full envoy, but she has deep knowledge of Libya and last year displayed a willingness to confront those in the political class opposed to elections.
The UN mission issued a statement urging all sides not to reverse the gains made, pointing to the registration of nearly 3 million voters, the successful distribution of voter cards and the applications of large numbers of candidates for the presidency and parliament as signs of deep popular support for elections.
The US ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland said "refusing to go to the elections and mobilizing to obstruct will only place the fate and future of the country at the mercy of those inside Libya and their external backers who prefer bullet power over ballot power "

Wendy Rogers calls New Zealand Prime Minister " Lenin with hair " claims " Satanic Communists " in the United States.
Republican Arizona Senator Wendy Rogers on Sunday called New Zealand 's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern " Lenin with Hair " and warned against communism in the United States.
Rogers appeared to be criticizing Ardern's COVID response as she referred to Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin in a Tweet she posted along with a short clip of the prime minister.
Rogers didn't further explain her criticism of Ardern in her Tweet.
In the clip, Ardern was speaking about COVID misinformation and New Zealand 's efforts to keep people informed about the pandemic.
"More bold Christians are needed in office to counter the satanic Communists in both parties " the Arizona Senator wrote in another tweet on Sunday.
Her tweet was met with ridicule from different social media users, with one person tweeting back " She should offer her definitions of Communism and Christianity because she does not understand either. "
"I see that Wendy is going all out today, trying to compete with the craziest of the crazy " another person tweeted.
Rogers has been vocal about her stance against communism before on social media.
In September, she called Labor Day a " Communist Holiday " without further explanation.
Her tweet was mocked among social media users, including The Arizona House Democrats, who replied: " Says the heart and soul of Arizona 's Republican Party ( prove them wrong ) . "
"They realize that if they keep falsely calling all good things communist, they only make communism more attractive. " asked another social media user.
Republican Senator Wendy Rogers warned against communists in America and called for having more " bold Christians " in office.
Writer Shiv Ramdas also denounced the tweet by paraphrasing her own words : " working is Communism. "
Separately, Rogers has frequently suggested that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election and called for a new election.
"I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona and a new election must be conducted.
Arizona's electors must not be awarded fraudulently " the senator tweeted in July.
In July, Rogers campaigned for the election to be decertified and previously launched a petition that she claimed gained 663,000 signatures.
"Things are really taking off.
Let's get to 1 million as soon as possible.
Audit results are coming soon, more states are coming online " she tweeted in September.
The Trump supporter has also pushed for debunked claims of voter fraud in Arizona.
Newsweek contacted Senator Rogers ' office for comment.
There is a circularity to it.
I think the meal boxes are an insane proposition.
The math they do is just crazy.
"They 're actually saving money because they don ' t have to go out and buy a whole bottle of soy sauce to try Asian cooking. "
I think that in the consumer space, cheaper goods at lower margins is the only reason that anyone outside of the upper class has experienced any sort of wage growth.
Wages didn't really go up, but shit got cheaper.
The problem is that they sold out the people below them.
He agrees with him.
Some of them need to give up at least some convenience to make society better.
Even if he is not in the income level that would pay more taxes, he can still buy fewer things that are more expensive so that they can be made by people making a living wage and he can be willing to wait a few days to get it so that some gig worker does not have to be worked to the bone.
" Interview with the Vampire " author Anne Rice died at the age of 80.
She died due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said.
Rice's biggest success was her first novel, " Interview with the Vampire " published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13- book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018.
"Lestat was the man of action, the man who could do things that I couldn't do " Rice said in a talk at Southern Illinois University in 2010.
" Interview with the Vampire " was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre which continued with the TV series " The Vampire Diaries " and the " Twilight " film series.
Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography.
Rice 's son, Christopher Rice, said he was at his mother 's bedside when she died.
Anne Rice will be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, with a public memorial planned next year.

Assam Anti- CAA Outfits pay tribute to people who died during protests.
Five agitators were killed during the anti- CAA riots in Assam two years ago.
Several organisations in Assam on Sunday paid tributes to the five agitators who were killed in the anti-CAA stir two years ago and resolved to resume the movement against the Act.
Memorial meetings were organised at the residence of Sam Stafford, one of the agitators who died, and a playground in Guwahati, with attendees resolving to once again to intensify the stir against the Citizenship ( Amendment ) Act.
The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS , which was among the first groups to organise protests against CAA after it was passed in Parliament , paid tributes to the agitators at Sam Stafford 's Hatigaon residence .
The Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who was a Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader during the stir and was jailed for his role in it, while paying floral tributes at the photographs of those who died, said that political parties and " nationalist organisations " must take the lead in resuming the movement.
Commenting on the artiste fraternity that had taken the centerstage in the 2019 stir, he said " They can't expect them to organise agitations.
Their help is crucial but they shouldn't be blamed for not reviving the movement.
All Assam Students' Union (AASU , another key player in the stir, organised a memorial at the Hatigaon Higher Secondary School playground.
Speaking on the occasion, AASU chief advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya said, "It is wrong to say that the anti- CAA movement has died out.
It had lost its intensity due to the commencement of examinations ( in January 2020 ) and then the pandemic and lockdowns.
They will resume the agitation with full intensity once again.
They won't let the sacrifices go in vain. " he said.
Mr Bhattacharya said the anti- CAA agitation will once again be a pan Northeast one like in 2019.
Singer- music composer Zubeen Garg, who had taken a leading role in the 2019 protests also paid his tributes at the programme organised by the AASU.
"We won't accept the CAA and that is for sure.
The government is trying to confuse them, but they will not allow them to accept it. " he said.
Several organisations, including AASU, North East Students ' Organisation ( NESO ) and Assam Jatiya Parishad ( AJP ) had observed " black day " on December 11 to mark two years of the passage of CAA in Parliament.
He is afraid that he would not be able to confirm the price of the bed until it is available on the website again as it was reduced in their winter sale, it is likely that this would not be the price of the article when it is added back to the website.
