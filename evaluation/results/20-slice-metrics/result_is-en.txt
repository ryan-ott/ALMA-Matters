He shouted at the world.
The marketing campaign "Looks Like You Need Iceland" has been well received and cries and shouts can be heard far and wide in the wilderness.
"The Icelanders have a colony, I need Iceland " says a woman in a comment on the advertisement from the marketing campaign " Looks Like You Need Iceland " on the YouTube channel.
The second viewer says that he will keep Iceland in his heart forever and an unmarried woman says that she will come to Iceland as soon as possible because her husband is living there.
However, she is now in the United States, where she will have to wait for a few months more..
Another spectator asks whether the roads to Iceland are open, because there are no planes.
It is not known whether he comes from another time belt.
Egill Þórðarson from the advertising agency Peel, who worked on the advert with the international advertising agency M & C Saatchi, said that the response has exceeded expectations.
"He has been involved in many of the Inspired by Iceland campaigns that have been very successful,, but this new campaign is already breaking records..
In essence, the goal is to create publicity, it is to get foreign media to cover the campaign,, and it has gone extremely well.
In a relatively short time, they have received coverage in over 700 media outlets around the world, reaching more than 2 billion people.
The value of the coverage is estimated at 180 million krones.
It is not a bad thing.
The main market for the campaign is the United States, and it has gone very well there, despite the fact that Americans are not on their way to the country.
According to Egil, known markets such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also taken well to it, as well as Russia, which came as a pleasant surprise.
There have been reactions from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically targeted.
" These advertisements have traveled further than they expected, " says Egill, but it is known that more than four million people have watched the material on YouTube.
"They had not been able to ask for a better start. "
The pictures here were taken by photographer Arni Sæberg of the Morgenblad newspaper during the filming of advertisements with the slogan " Let It Out " in mid- the last month.
The filming took place all over the country, in Reykjavik on Skovorodden, at Reynisfjord, at Sólheimajökli and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfda.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cameraman was Óttar Guðnason.
In these roles, the Norwegian Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
The Icelandic crew worked on the making of the advertisements, at the same time as filming took place in Southern Norway, another group was working in Western Norway and the Westfjords.
According to Egil, " Let It Out " is only the first part of the " Looks Like You Need Iceland " campaign, but a winter campaign is planned in cooperation with M & C Saatchi.
"This is the first phase of the work for the Icelandic Tourist Office,, says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M & C Saatchi has gone very well.
"It's fantastic to work with them.
In such projects, it is crucial to have a foreign partner with knowledge of the markets they are talking about.

As soon as he read the script, he knew who this character was,, said Donovan about his role in Clueless.
He did not want to leave the police station after the night shift.
Fifty cases were brought to the police in the capital area on the same day and the police daybook states that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to intervene in a man who had been recently released from custody after having been detained there due to drunken driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man was sentenced to continued detention at the police station because of his behavior..
In the morning, a man was arrested on suspicion of breaking into a company in Kópavog..
The police also had to deal with two men in Breiðholt because of reports of physical assault.
Also, a woman who was eating at a restaurant in Kópavog was not able to pay for her meal at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.

The death of the Gleestars - A horrible fate for the Gleestars.
This theory has gained popularity on the Internet in the wake of the death of actress Naya Rivera, who drowned in California a few days ago and became the third lead actor to die before the age of 40 in the series.
The Glee series is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The series focused on the so-called joy band of high school students, their love affairs and their fate.
It was not always taken with joy to be a member of the band, but through song and dance, the characters of the series managed to overcome the obstacles that arose in their lives..
In the absence of the shooting location, great tragedies have befallen the actors and crew members of the series, to the extent that rumors have begun to circulate about a curse on the series.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the series, a cheerleader who did not call all her mother.
After the series ran its course, Rivera went on to marry actor Ryan Dorsey and had one son, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they split up as a result.
However, Dorsey declined to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On 8 July last, it was announced that Riveru was missing after her four--year old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a lifeboat on board the boat and was able to tell the police that he and his mother had jumped into the water and were rescued by Rivera, but never returned to the boat.
The search for Rivera began in earnest.
The day after the search began, the police chief of the area announced that he believed Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found dead and was officially declared dead.
It is believed that she was caught in a strong current in the water and used her last effort to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded as drunkenness.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson, the American football player with the angelic voice, who played a key role in bringing the Glee choir to prominence.
Outside of the shows, Moneith was struggling with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he struggled with addiction and found it difficult to overcome it.
In 2013, his colleagues in the series were tired of him and urged him to seek help.
Moneith went into treatment at that time and seemed to be on the road to recovery.
Only two months after he finished treatment, Moneith was found dead in his hotel room after going out to celebrate with friends..
The mixture of drugs and alcohol was deadly.
It was not believed that it was an act of will.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for drugs had decreased so much that a substance that he had previously tolerated well proved to be lethal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
The death of Moneith was a heavy burden on his co--star, Lea Michele, but it was decided to continue filming the episodes and dedicate them to the memory of Moneith and his character, Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah " Puck " Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow Glee Club members until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of child pornography.
During a search of his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found and the matter soon became public..
Ljóst was that Salling was finished.
He was charged and convicted for his crimes.
He had been sentenced to four to seven years in prison, in addition to having to register as a sex offender and seek treatment for pedophilia.
Before the judge had decided on the punishment, Salling, who was then out of custody, was found near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not only the actors in the series who fell far behind in age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the episodes.
He died in his sleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
She also worked on the show with a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the big star, Julia Roberts, and accused her sister of being a megalomaniac and disrespectful.
Motes took her own life in 2014 but she struggled with severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her husband, in which she accused her mother and sisters of being responsible for her plight.
" Her mother and the so--called siblings have nothing after him except the memory of the fact that they were the ones who caused his worst depression. "
Lea Michel was a star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying her co--stars on the set and abusing her star status.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunken driving in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
In 2010, she became the victim of unscrupulous computer hackers who posted pictures of her naked on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the series and had a relationship outside of the series.
Bonoist later revealed that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
Það is possible to put flowers on almost everything.
It enhances the development of children when they play outdoors with their parents and cultivate flowers and watch them grow.
It is also possible to do with flowers, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
It is only the time spent with the children in the garden that is never forgotten..
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and, of course, the precious time they spent with their parents.
Bought a boat after the tenth grade.
"There are not many sailors who work in children's daycare centers in Norway, " says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who works as a fisherman during the summer but studies psychology at the University of Oslo during the winter.
Strandveiid is a very pleasant summer job when one is studying..
If the fishing is good, it is possible to earn a good income and it is fantastic to be able to give up the idea of getting a scholarship.
The income from the summer is enough for him in the winter as well. " says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25- year old psychology student, who has been engaged in coastal fishing in the summer as in the previous summers.
Axel was new to the dock at Tálknafjord when a newspaper reporter caught up with him late in the evening of the first week of the month.
"The winter he was in tenth grade, he took the boat captain's license for boats under 12 meters and bought his own boat the summer after graduating from high school.
He has been engaged in coastal fishing on his boat all summers since..
He bought the boat from a friend, named Hartmann Jonsson, and named the boat after him.
Hartmann was already an adult when he bought the boat and had stopped sailing, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after Axel took over the ship, and he bought the ship for three million.
"He made a contract with Hartmann to pay half of the money, one and a half million in the beginning of the summer and the other half in the end of the summer when he had finished fishing.
He had the boat free of debt at the end of his first summer on it.
In other words, a boy with one and a half million krones in his pocket was able to buy a boat when he had just finished high school..
" He had been working with his father on the sea when he was a boy, he had been working with his father on the sea when he was a boy and he got his share of the fish.
He also put his confirmation money into his sailing fund.
Axel was born in Isafjord, where all his mother's family is from, but he has lived in Kopenhagen since he was a boy.
"I can hunt in the west of Norway because he has a residence permit with his grandmother in Isafjord.
He learned to ride horses on this area in the west of the country with his father.
He travels between the fjords depending on how he feels, because this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although he prefers to fish in the west, he has also fished in the vicinity of Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
He has also fished for salmon in the south, but the most common fish is the sea trout. " Axel, who always goes fishing early in the morning, says that he sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky in the silence of the sea.
"Netsamband out at sea is good, so that he can call, listen to radio broadcasts and listen to music.
It's no problem to be alone on a boat.
Naturally, he tries to avoid being in danger, but there have been occasional bad weather, but he has never been seasick. " Axel, who is lucky because he is never seasick..
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes each time.
"In fishing, he is never more than 14 hours at sea in one day,, but he has also been fishing in other quota systems,, for example in the lease quota, when he has been out at sea for one and a half days fishing.
The arrangement for shore fishing is such that he is allowed to catch 770 kilograms a day, which he finds restrictive.
"Other restrictions are that he is not allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and that he is only allowed to fish for 12 days in a month during the four months of stranded fishing in May, June, July and August..
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days based on weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to sail, rather than having 48 days over the summer and being able to sail at their own discretion.
In the same way, the area division could also apply to him, and that fishing stations well situated near fishing grounds should be allowed to profit from this,, says Axel, who mainly catches salmon on his coastal fishing trips, but also a few other species.
Axel works over the winter with his university studies at the Nupi kindergarten in Kópavog..
"There are not many seafarers working in the daycare centers of the country,, says Axel proudly and adds that he only intended to work temporarily at the daycare center.
"He stayed there because he thought it was a great job.
I hope that the psychology degree will be useful to him on the preschool level in the future,, says Axel, who is also a long way through a degree in business economics.
Villa in the registration list came in the way of the homecoming smugglers.
The villa in the registration book that people fill out when they come to the country was the cause of the fact that a person who was living in the country was not called back for a re-examination.
There is no obligation to register on the basis of the English version of the application form, as is the case when it is done in Norwegian.
"This will be examined in the coming week, " says a specialist in the SARS department of the Ministry of Health.
Three domestic infections were detected in the virology department of the Landspitals on the previous day.
One of those who turned out to be positive arrived in the country on the 15th of July, two days after the introduction of the so-called homecoming quarantine..
Those who were búsetted in Iceland were screened upon their arrival to the country and again four to five days later.
In the afternoon news of RÚV, it was stated that he had followed the old system.
The screening at the border was negative and he was not called back for a second screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in the Department of Disease Prevention at the Ministry of Health, says in a conversation with the news agency that this may be due to a flaw in the electronic registration passport.
Filling out the registration sheet in English is not a requirement to register, as it is in the Icelandic version..
It was first and foremost intended for foreign tourists.
The person in question did not receive an automatic invitation to take part in the survey.
Kamilla says that many have followed the rules about homecomings, although they have filled the registration forms in English and in some cases, employers have also been vigilant about sending people back for a second test after they arrived in the country.
"This will be examined in the coming week to see how it is possible to make it easier for people to gain access to this in order to raise awareness of it. "
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all went through the screening process, but two were showing symptoms..
Smitrakning is now in progress with the three smits detected on the previous day, but it is mostly completed due to the two smits detected on the previous day.
In both cases, DNA analysis by the Institute of Genetics at the University of Oslo has revealed that it is a variant of the coronavirus that has not previously been found in Norway.
In the other case, the bonds were directed to Israel, although it was known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries..
Kamilla says that it would be clear on the next day where the virus was coming from.
There are now 15 people in isolation according to the web site, Covid. is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four of the five infections are unrelated.
Five domestic infections have been reported in Norway in recent days.
From the four, three are completely unrelated and, for example, have not been able to find the origin of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup athletics competition in the previous day.
Smitrakning is still ongoing.
The original 30 were sent into isolation in pairs, but they were reduced to 16.
In total, 34 are in quarantine due to the new infections that were detected the previous day.
This is the second time in a short period of time that an infection has been detected at an athletic event and has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jøhann K. Jøhannsson, head of communications at the Ministry of the Interior Police Directorate, says that it is possible, as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
"We are constantly urging all those who live in the area to take individual measures to prevent the spread of infection.
They also need to warn people who are organizing events that there are certain rules that must be followed..
Then it is possible to hold events,, says Johan.
He says that it is possible to prevent the spread of infection by raising awareness of individual protection.
Rules and guidelines are constantly being revised.
"What needs to be done, and what the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health are constantly urging people to do,, is to take care of the individual prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.
Both at home and at the service company.
People wash their hands and use spray.
It prevents the spread of infection, " says Johan.
"They need to encourage people to continue on the good path they were on, in order to maintain the success they have achieved so far..
40 % of the victims of COVID-19 were suffering from diabetes 2.
Devon Brumfield heard through the telephone how difficult it was for her father to breathe.
Her father was suffering from diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was buried.
The death was attributed to sudden respiratory difficulties due to the coronavirus infection.
Sickle Cell Disease was listed on the death certificate as the underlying cause and Brumfield, who also has Sickle Cell Disease, is afraid that he will die for himself.
The Reuters news agency says that Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
The results of a new study commissioned by US authorities show that nearly 40% of those who died were suffering from syphilis type 2, which is the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who have not reached 65 years of age is considered, the proportion rises to half.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) took to more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in infectious diseases at the CDC, says the results are striking, especially for those who have syphilis and their partners.
In 12 countries, Reuters conducted a survey and the results showed similar percentages.
10 states, among which are California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet able to differentiate the underlying diseases.
"Sickle Cell Disease was in an epidemic at the time and was spreading rapidly.
In the meantime, the COVID - 19 has broken through like a powerful tide, " according to Reuters, Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, which also suffered worse from the coronavirus.
The best protection for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease in check with physical exercise, a healthy diet and the help of health professionals.
The coronavirus epidemic has, however, made it difficult for many to maintain routine.
Then, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue to work in order to avoid being exposed to the virus..
Reuters reports that American authorities have been aware of the danger posed by the sykursyke 2 virus.
In the SARS epidemic of 2003, more than 20% of those with the disease were affected, and in the swine flu epidemic of 2009, this group was three times more likely to be admitted to hospital.
When MERS hit in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized had syphilis.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID 19 virus may last longer, the disease has stripped away the veil of ignorance over a number of previously unknown complications.
" He fears that there will be a flood of problems when this is over, " says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the world association of diabetics.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus epidemic could indirectly lead to an increase in complications associated with syphilis, such as kidney disease and kidney failure.
There are new studies to suggest that the coronavirus could lead to an increase in cases of syphilis.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the connection between the coronavirus and syphilis.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weakened by syphilis.
Then, a high proportion of glucose and lipids among sycrosis sufferers can cause a true " bacterial storm " as it is called when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Damaged intracellular membranes can also lead to the formation of bubbles, which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
"This is all one big jigsaw puzzle,, says Dela Cruz.
"It is all interconnected. "
The report has been corrected.
"They were offered champagne, then they left the room. "
The couple, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason were asked by the artist Ragnar Kjartansen to have sex in front of a camera for a work he was setting up in Paris.
"They loved each other so much that it was not complicated. "
Atli Bollason never forgets when he meets his wife and mother-in law, Åsrún Magnúsdottir, for the first time.
" He was very impressed by her.
It was natural that it was just the radiation,, but he also thought that it was absolutely unbelievably sexy..
He still thinks it. he says.
Ásrún also remembers this, because her husband regularly reminds her of their first meeting.
"I's always hearing this story.
The last weekend,, she says, she was also attracted to her husband at first sight..
"Mér fann that and still feels that there is a lot of hype around Atle, which she likes..
There are a lot of things going on and a lot of things are happening and he was fascinated by it.
Atli says that the couple have emphasized their own paths in their relationship.
" They do not tie their baggage to the same knot as their fellow travellers.
In the past, they avoided routines that they observed around them.
It is possible that they took the offer from Ragnar Kjartansson, the artist, with great enthusiasm,, although it was quite unusual.
"Kirsten Anna's common friend has contacted them and asked if they could come to eat dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg, at Snaps. "
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and one each after dinner.
They listened to Ragnar as he led them through his plans for a painting exhibition he intended to set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
"He had a film called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way.
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he wanted to shoot and at the end, he told them that he wanted to know whether they were interested in taking part. "
Senan, who Ragnar asked to take part in, was to show young middle class couples falling in love in a minimalistic room..
"This is a meeting of the beginning and the end, " Atli says.
Parið þekkted Ragnar little, though they had known of him and he of them " but they knew them and thought they fitted in.
They said that they did not want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who were sexually frustrated because they had to perform for others.
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"When they walked out of Snap, they said, "I'm not only in this. "
It was just like that.
He trusted Ragnar as an artist and the whole team he had. "Asrún and Atli say.
"This is about love and intimacy "
Senan was taken up in a fine apartment in Myrargate.
There was a very small film crew, the director, Ragnar and the sound man and the couple.
After the recording was completed, everyone left the studio except Atli and Ásrún.
"They had not decided what they were going to do.
They received some instructions, but they tried to forget time and place.
To be unaware of what they were doing and for whom.
It was not played, they just loved each other, so it was not complicated. " says Åsrún.
En was romantic.
"Yes, it was a little romantic, " says Atli and Åsrún agrees.
"They were offered champagne before they left the room..
It was like being on holiday in a fancy hotel in Paris.
The team was pleased with the couple's performance in the play that moved them.
"When Tommi the cameraman saw it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful. " says Atli.
"It's just as much about love and intimacy as it is about sex itself. "
The couple's parents have seen the play and Atli says that his mother heard the voice of his son at the National Theatre in Reykjavik and then realized that he was part of the play.
"Then she turns around and starts to think about it,, " Atli says.
"Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
He had not told anyone this, but he sent a letter to his father and said " It was fun to meet the little family at the Palais de Tokyo. "
And the participation in the work has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atle.
"We are still together, maybe even more than before..
That deepened her relationship with her extended family,, says Åsrún and laughs.
Sjálf saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleagues.
"It was difficult for her to be with someone other than her husband,, " she says and turns to her husband.
"It was fun to see this, because it is only one scene in a larger work, and when it is seen with the other works, it is very impressive.
He was able to break away from it a little and was proud.
And there was a little baby in her belly,, says Åsrún, who was pregnant with her second child when the scene was filmed.
"It was just beautiful.
Anna Marsibil Clausen was interviewed by Åsrūn and Atla in the RAS 1 series of Love Stories.

Ambassadorless for five years from 2009.
Jeffery Gunter Ross, the American ambassador to Iceland, is in the limelight after CBS reported in the morning that he wanted to have armed bodyguards because he feared for his life.
It has not always been easy for the President of the United States to appoint ambassadors to Norway..
From April 2009, when Carol Van Voorst resigned as US ambassador to Norway,, the country has been without an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned from office under unusual circumstances in 2009, when Kastljos reported that she had been nominated for the Order of the Falcon.
On the way to the farewell ceremony with the President, she received a telephone call from the President's office saying that she would not be awarded the Order.
After she left Iceland, she became acquainted with international relations at the Army War College.
Six months passed before Van Voorst's successor took office in September 2010.
This is partly due to the fact that Robert S. Connan was appointed as ambassador, but then resigned.
At the time of the job, Louis Ariega had been working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for over a decade..
He resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
This was followed by a second period without an ambassador.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015 and took up his post shortly afterwards, when there had been no ambassador to the country for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but was not a diplomat, having worked as a lawyer and fundraiser for Barack Obama's campaign.
He resigned from his post on 20 January 2017, the same day that Donald Trump took office as president, as is customary with politically appointed ambassadors.
The Trump administration was unusually long in appointing both ambassadors and high--ranking officials in the Washington government..
Two years later, the United States Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to its meeting to appoint him as the United States ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony to the parliament, he said that he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, and that his wife, who is deceased, was of Norwegian descent.
Gunter is politically appointed and was previously a plastic surgeon in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Sheldon Adelson, the owner of Spilavit, founded the organization, but Adelson is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, when no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017 for two years and four months.
The reason is both the length of time it took for Trump to appoint people to key positions and the fact that the work of the United States Congress had dragged on for a long time,, including the appointment of ambassadors.
Since 2009, there have been no ambassadors in Iceland for five years.
However, this has not prevented the embassy from carrying out its own projects,, which opened new headquarters at Engjateig in 2010.
The construction is said to have cost around 65 million euros, and the building is surrounded by bulletproof walls and bulletproof glass in all the windows.
However, this does not seem to have been enough to satisfy the current ambassador's security concerns, he is said to fear for his life and has asked for armed bodyguards.
A former player of ÍBV was subjected to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland "
Tonny Mawejje, a former player of ÍBV, says that he was subjected to racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This comes from an interview with Tonny, which was published in the Ugandan newspaper Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC, who play in the top division of Uganda..
In an interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Norway, where he played for ÍBV, Val and Þrótti.
"When he came to Iceland, he did not play in the midfield as he was used to..
Fyrirliði of the team was in that position but he was also wearing the jersey number that he wanted, so he didn't get either of them. " said Tonny but he played on the right wing during the season with ÍBV.
Among other things, Tonny talks about the racism he experienced in Norway.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
"This happened to him once, but because he did not understand the language, he ignored what was said to him..
Later, he learned of the case and asked his friend what it was about.
He told him that his opponent had made racist remarks about him after he tackled him.
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
He says he made the mistake that he regrets the most.
Tommie had not managed to break into the starting line-up at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to qualify for the national team.
He then asked to be loaned back to Ísland but he then went to play for Val.
"It was a mistake to return to Iceland on loan.
He held that if he had stayed longer in Norway, he would have received the opportunity he wanted, "Tonn said, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would go further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland made it impossible for him to fulfill his dreams of playing in a big club in Europe.
A worm was found in a woman's throat.
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 inch long black worm in the throat of a woman who was admitted to the hospital.
The surgeons managed to pull the worm out with tongs.
Research led to the conclusion that it was a parasitic worm.
CNN reports this.
Kona had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the tapeworm was removed, but tapeworms are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi became popular in Western countries, the number of cases where parasitic worms have infected people has increased, according to CNN.
It is feared that a second wave is about to start in Europe.
Spain is now in the limelight due to concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where governments have taken action to curb the spread of the new outbreak.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the infection is spreading..
The other European countries have also taken action in response to the increase in the number of infections in Spain, and in Britain all those returning from Spain are required to go into quarantine, as in Norway, and the French have been warned against travelling to Spain.
Smitum is also increasing in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between restricting the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to other parts of the world, as the number of new infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 per day, with the highest rates in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University's count, and deaths attributed to the virus have reached 644,000.
Mosaic work by Gerða is now finally given its due.
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavik, there is a large and deep hole.
Above them are men wearing orange helmets..
There is also a large excavator.
and more of the smaller work vehicles.
The road is closed for traffic.
The gangway is wide and there are now many people standing on it and admiring the mosaic of millions of pieces of stone - as if they have never seen it before..
They may have never seen it before.
At least he didn't see it for himself.
The project has been hidden up until now, it was right in front of it, there were parking spaces that were always occupied.
People left their cars there, locked them in a hurry, and then rushed off to their assignments in the city center.
"Lively and diverse public space " and " attractive cityscape " are the guiding principles for the reconstruction of the Tryggvagate.
The purpose is to improve the appearance of the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerda Helgadottir at the Tollhouse to be seen better.
In front of the construction site, a square is built and because the area is well exposed to the sun, it is considered suitable as a rest area for travellers.
The artwork is lit up and is now able to be seen more clearly on the 142 square metres of space.
In the area, there are also small " mists of water sculptures, which offer play and provide the area with a certain mysticism.
In this way, the renovations are described by the municipality of Reykjavik as being carried out in conjunction with Veitum.
The water, heat and electricity distribution networks are to be renewed.
Many of them are over 100 years old, but the sewage pipeline and cold water pipeline from 1925 have served the residents and businesses in the city center for nearly a century.
When the road is reopened after the completion of the works, cars can be driven on it again.
It is, however, a one--way street, and as a result, it creates more peaceful and accessible spaces for pedestrians..
In the history of the Tollhouse on the toll administrator's website, it says that the building was opened in 1971 and was designed by Gísli Halldórsson.
Because the ship hit the house, a wall of 250 square meters without windows was formed in front of the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a flat surface would have a negative impact on the overall cityscape, unless special measures were taken to enhance the appearance of the building.
The parties agreed that it would be appropriate to erect a permanent monument there.
At this time, there was a lot of talk about Gerði Helgadottir, the artist, in the summary..
She had worked on many mosaic projects in Germany and elsewhere.
AFRaradi was to have first contact with her before deciding whether a competition would be held for the work.
Often there had been discussions about the need to reflect life at the harbor, since the harbor had been the lifeblood of Reykjavik since it was built.
When the artist was interviewed, she became fascinated by the work.
It was agreed that she would receive sketches and other assistance before she left the country,, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerdur received the time she wanted, and when she returned home, she put forward a number of proposals for discussion.
Agreement was reached quickly to ask her to work on the project.
At the same time, it was requested to make a joint agreement with her and the famous art restoration company in Germany, the Oidtmann brothers,, as Gerður had worked with them for a long time in the restoration of famous works of art in various parts of Europe.
Agreements were made and Gerður won the contract to build the sculpture in the workshop of their brothers,, who then took care of the installation of the Toll House.
All of the work was carried out exceptionally well by both Gerðar Helgadottir and the Oidtmann brothers, it says in the summary.
It has withstood the harshness of the Icelandic weather since it was built.
It took Gerði two years to complete the work, which was completed in 1972 and 1973.
The sculptor died two years after the completion of the tollhouse,, only 47 years old.
Prepares for the transfer of more institutions to the countryside.
Asmundur Einar Daðason, the minister for social affairs, announced that more public institutions would be relocated to the countryside in the near future.
The minister said this in the television program Sprengisand in the morning on Bylgjane.
Recently, it was announced that the fire brigade department of the Housing and Man-made Structures Agency would be moved north to Sauðarøy in autumn.
There are fire safety experts at the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency north, and the National Association of Fire and Rescue Services has criticized the relocation.
"I think that they should take further steps in this situation.
He is preparing to take further steps in this situation.
Frekari flights " said Asmundur.
He says that he is convinced that the vast majority of the population want to see a greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
"It is necessary to take further political decisions about the transfer of public jobs out of the city,, as he was doing with the Housing and Man-made Environment Agency,, but he also took the example of other institutions that have been moved out to the countryside,, such as the transfer of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute to Akranes, the Norwegian Land Survey to Skagaströnd and the unemployment allowance to Skagaströnd.
All the main events from the second day of the championships.
The 94th edition of the Iceland Athletics Championships ended at Thorsstadion in Akureyri on the day.
Several records were broken on the second competition day.
The women's javelin throw was expected to be a thrilling competition at Thorsstadion, but Vigdís Jonsdottir from FH set the women's javelin throw record in 2014, which stood until May 2015, when Elisabet Rut Rúnarsdottir from ÍR broke the record.
Vigdís won back the national record earlier in the summer and has been in fantastic form in the second half of the season, but she has tripled the national record in the second half of the season.
Elisabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and was not at her best on the day..
She had only one good throw of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the furthest in the day with a distance of 60.08 meters in her last attempt and set a new meet record in the process.
She set her national record earlier in July, with a distance of 62.69 meters, but she was not close to it.
Gudrun Karitas Hallgrimsdottir from I.R. had the second best throw of the day but improved her personal best with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's competition, the FH athlete, Hilmar Örn Jónsson won the gold medal in the javelin throw with a throw of 73.84 meters in his last throw of the competition and set a new competition record.
His national record in the event is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympic athlete and national champion in the discus throw, competed in the hammer throw at Thorsstadium on the previous day and competed in the discus throw on the following day, which is his main event.
Guðna Vals set a national record of 65.53 meters in the event, throwing 59.13 meters on the day and securing victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the furthest in the day, he had one good throw that earned him second place with a distance of 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardottir, the world champion in long jump, won the long jump competition with an overwhelming victory. Hafdís jumped 6.25 meters in the day, which is just 40 centimeters from her own world record.
In the women's 200m, it was ÍR athlete Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds but her national record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Gudbjörg Jona was successful in Akureyri, she won two gold medals in the 100 metre sprint and in the 4 x 100 metre relay, and also in the 4 x 400 metre relay in the day.
In the men's competition, FH's Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson was first in the 200 metre sprint with a time of 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna won gold in the 100 metre sprint and the 400 metre run in the previous day.
He is not punished for the 27 million krone Bitcoin harvest.
The Ombudsman's Committee has rejected the claim of the head of the police's criminal investigation department that he was entitled to seize money from a man for not reporting his income from the sale of Bitcoin.
The committee comes to the conclusion that the police chief did not provide sufficient evidence to justify the arrest of the man.
In the verdict of the committee, it was stated that the man had violated the statutory tax returns for the years 2016 and 2017.
He had neglected to declare his income from Bitcoin sales of 27 million krones, either intentionally or through gross negligence.
The man was arrested for his behaviour.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, he overcame this by selling rafmynt for 27 million in 2016.
In 2009 and 2010, Hana had been able to acquire him with a greftri, as it was both easy and inexpensive to do so with a normal home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the rafmynts, the taxation of such sales had been very unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been difficult to expect that ordinary citizens would have been aware of such decisions on the tax front..
He had not intended to avoid paying the tax on the harvest and had declared his ownership of the property on the harvest register as a deposit on a currency account.
He had complained to both experts and the state tax inspector about the situation, but without success.
He then considered that it was necessary to take account of the fact that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived there for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He had therefore been in a worse position than others to understand the complex rules that the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion on.
The man considered that it was right to recalculate his taxes for those two income years and to apply a penalty, but otherwise he would not be punished.
He then repeated that he was working in Iceland and had paid taxes in the country since 2012.
He had never intended to evade his obligations by unlawful means.
Krafan for sequestration was overwhelming and would put him in debt.
Brynjólfur says "This man understands what football is all about. "
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been somewhat controversial with people but also attracted praise for his performance with Breiðablik during the first half of the season in the Pepsi Max deild.
Blikar are in the limelight in the evening when they take on ÍA in a live broadcast on Stöod 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is banned from playing for four games due to four warnings during the season, and therefore does not play with a new haircut as he did in the previous games of the season.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his head for the match against HK the previous Friday, which HK won 1-0.
"He did not know exactly who he was responding to with the payment,, but in terms of character, he was trying hard in the game.
He did not hide himself.
He wanted the ball every time and if there was one to equalize the game, he would have done it or created it, said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stand when he spoke about Brynjólf.
"He should be here for the people. "
"It is sometimes hard to figure out what position he is in.
He is a little more to the left when the game goes on,, but he has a very free role in the team,, said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says that Brynjólf is a real entertainer and that he is happy to have such a colorful man in the league. " There is no disagreement about the fact that he is a character.
This is a fun personality and he likes his hair and is always ready for interviews..
It's unbelievable how many people are fascinated by him, which tells me that this man knows what football is about.
"He is an entertainer.
He is there for the people and to have fun with them..
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying to get in and watch what is written on his hair.
This man is a genius, said Máni.
The KR player says he wants to leave the club - "He has been in contact with several teams in the B- division. "
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in the Pepsi Max deild, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish newspaper Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Fótbolti.net also reported on the case..
Toby wants to start the season in his home country,, but first he has to terminate his contract with KR,, as the Danish league begins earlier than the Norwegian one..
The association knows that he misses Denmark and has shown him great understanding,, said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
" He has been in contact with a number of teams in the second division and is likely to change teams before the end of the Norwegian season.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can allow themselves to pay up the contract with KR.
He says that he will have to take a salary cut in Denmark.
" Danish companies may have been more affected by the economic effects of the virus than in Iceland. "
Bjartmar Hjolhviseur has restored millions of bicycles - and is now on trial for his actions in Dagbladet.
In the past year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby that is different from most others.
Hann climbs up and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, motorcycles and tricycles.
Bjartmar has earned the nickname " the hitchhiker " for his travels.
In the morning, there was a lot of fraying when the man told the story of his relationship with Bjartmar..
The DV reported that Bjartmar had spoken to the man on Austervelt and told him that the bike may have been stolen.
It was not possible to deduce anything other than that Bjartmar had robbed him from the original writings of the raftsman.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV report has been altered to reflect this.
Bjartmar says that the original reports of the incident were not accurate.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from the victim of a rape victim that these were indeed his rape victims.
The information she received from the alleged owner came from other sources, these turned out to be false, Bjartmar says.
" He saw the cows and he recognized the helicopter, and ended up with information about a helicopter that had been missing for a long time and was being searched for..
He hesitated for a while, but when he saw the man preparing to drive off in the boat, he decided to shoot him.
The owner was convinced of his innocence and decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, he goes very well in such matters,, but before he managed to finish what he had to say, the man had taken away his words.
Bjartmar says that the man on the raft offered to show him the ticket for the boat and called the police himself.
"Yes, good, " Bjartmar said, " it's just as it is. "
The owner of the helicopter proved his ownership of the helicopter and took off.
Later, the real owner of the helicopter told his story on Facebook, like in the first report..
On this short period of time that Bjartmar has been engaged in this activity, he says that he has been able to count the number of times that he has got into altercations with people on the other hand.
" He has had friendly relations with the most difficult men in Reykjavik,, he said Bjartmar and pointed out that the bicycle thieves are usually small brothers and sisters of society, drug addicts, mentally ill people and other people who live on the streets.
"Fíknin is a hard landlord and, unfortunately, thievery is the easiest way to achieve this goal. Bjartmar says.
"My relationship with these people is so good that she has brought many of these good people with her.
Examples are that people have been in treatment and have taken themselves in hand and have come to him and helped him with what he is doing. " he says.
In general, Bjartmars' interactions with cyclists are on a courteous basis.
Some people know of him and what he is doing, and are willing to show him registration numbers, tail numbers of planes and so on..
Horse theft is a major problem that has received little attention.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police have even begun to advise people to talk to him from stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the first reports of DV and says that he is not a self--appointed police officer in a personal search for justice.
Asked whether he is not yet on thin ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police,, Bjartmar says that it is.
"After all, it is the police's duty to do this, but the truth of the matter is that the police are not doing this.
For example, he has seen police officers driving away from a large pile of stolen bicycles.
She is completely uninvolved in these matters.
"When the policeman is not doing anything in this case, and it is right in front of his nose, and the experience has shown that he has been successful in this field,, he says Bjartmar.
He says that he has achieved such great success in catching stolen bicycles that he sometimes runs into his " protectors " on the street, and that these " protectors " have just taken the bicycles they had previously stolen.
The times that Bjartmar has called on the police for assistance have come when she has not met him.
"This is not working with the police, and it is not the police's fault and it is not the owners of the bicycles' fault, " said Bjartmar and said it was a shame that victims of bicycle theft had to suffer for the inaction of the police.
Bjartmars's achievements are not disputed.
There are many stories of people thanking Bjartmari for returning their property to them..
Sjálfur says Bjartmar has long since lost count of the number of bicycles he has given away, and estimates that the number is in the millions, or even tens of millions.
Vega has electric cars, electric bicycles and electric heavy vehicles, but an electric bicycle can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a day care center and every other weekend he works at a shelter.
His bicycle hunting is unpaid work that he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows.
The year 2019 was a big anniversary year in the history of the life savings societies in Iceland..
The embættismen had received pensions from the Danish king all through the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for embættismen was established, which eventually became a pension fund for all public employees.
The foundation for the current state of the general labour union's welfare funds was laid in 1969 with the general workplace agreement, which stipulated the establishment of labor-- related welfare funds with compulsory membership and full-fledged welfare funding from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were set on the basis of these agreements and the welfare system continued to grow after that.
It was not the only radical change that the labour movement of the 20th century forced through with its struggle for wages.
In historic strikes in 1955, the unions gradually achieved their demands for sick leave rights and sickness funds, significant reductions in working hours, improvements in housing conditions and other matters of great importance.
All of these rights were hard- fought and costly, but in hindsight proved to be greater and more lasting in terms of wage increases in the salary structure, which vanished as quickly as the high inflation that characterized the period after the war and up until 1990, as many remember.
The prelude to the establishment of the general welfare funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
In the end, men agreed that the funds were in fact the property of the members of the unions, but the labour movement had to accept that the boards of the unions would be made up of representatives of both the employers and the members of the unions.
In the next years after the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers in the boards of the funds became a topic of debate in labor unions, but it never reached a consensus, and as a result, workers are still in the minority in the boards of the funds.
In the 36th paragraph of the law no. 129 of 1997 on the obligation to protect the rights to lifelong employment and the operation of the lifelong employment associations, the funding strategy of the lifelong employment associations is discussed.
In the first sentence of the 1st paragraph, it says that "the welfare fund should have the welfare of the members as its focus. "
Also says in the 5th line of the 5th paragraph, that the pension fund sets its own ethical guidelines for investments.
In the hluthafastefne of the Lífeyrissjóðs verslunarmenn there are, among other things, the following provisions, in the wake of the aforementioned law provisions.
The Lifesaving Society is a member of the UN PRI for responsible investments, along with many of the largest lifesaving societies and investors in the west and in Europe.
In the regulations, it is stated that the emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance,, can contribute to improved profitability of shareholding companies.
Thus, the interests of the investors and the goals of the nation are in harmony in a wider context.
LV believes that it is important for companies, especially those that are registered on the stock market, to have a public policy on good corporate governance, good working conditions, social responsibility and environmental issues.
Gildi has set itself a " policy of responsible investments " and there are similar provisions.
This is all recounted here as the introduction to the latest fad in the Norwegian language, " shadow governance.
Since the word is new in the language, it is not certain that it has been fully defined,, but it seems that the following definition is " the most common " : Shadow governance is when the leader of a trade union says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the union to the board of the pension fund with instructions or instructions on how they should take a position in a particular matter.
If they do not follow the instructions, they will be dismissed from the board at the first opportunity.
If the leader of the party does not use this in the media and does not talk about dismissal, it is not " shadow government " because such communication between people is always present in the financial world.
He asks the reader to contemplate which of the two routes he finds " shadowy " .
It is mainly two men who have tried to shape this definition when it was written on the morning of 25 July 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at the newspaper Fréttablade, and Asgeir Jonsson, the head of the State Bank.
The reason for both of them was after that Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair announced his intention to terminate the contracts of the airline's flight attendants and flight attendants ( firing them ) and Ragnar Þór Ingolfsson, chairman of the Verslunarmannafelag Reykjavik sent out the warning to the representatives of the union in the board of the Lifeyrissjød of the Verslunarmannafelag Reykjavik that they would not support the possibility of the union buying shares in the company, otherwise they would be fired.
Nokkru later, Bogi Nils changed his decision and in the wake of this Ragnar Þór went the same way with his advice, which was based on Boga's decision.
However, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to discuss the matter in the Friday edition of the newspaper Freetimes with large words about shadow governance, lawbreaking and the need for changes to the law.
There was a small hare that was able to carry a heavy load, though the blessed hare was in a precarious position and was quickly dried out..
As the matter is important, they should focus on the substance at the end.
He examined those aspects of the laws governing life-etime pension funds that are relevant to this case.
In these, the board of trustees are obliged to take care of the interests of the members and have ethical guidelines in their investments, and these are further defined in the regulations of both the Gild and the Lifeyrissjød.
Lífeyrissjóðs, on the other hand, are not supposed to focus solely on short--term profit in their investments.
This is a dangerous policy and it is not difficult to find examples of this in the past, where large sums of money from banks and funds were given to reckless adventurers and environmental vandals with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was clearly on thin ice when he decided to dismiss a whole group of employees, thereby reducing the goodwill of the company on the Icelandic market and weakening its position in the eyes of investors.
As it turned out, he saw the error of his ways and took it back.
The time will show whether the investments of the labour union's subsidiaries in the company can be considered to be legitimate in the eyes of the members of the labour union's subsidiaries..

Einn of the infected did not have a homecoming test.
One of the three who were diagnosed with the disease in the country on the 15th of July last, came to the country from an Eystrasalts country on the 15th of July last, for about one and a half weeks.
He is an Icelander who is not living in the country permanently and therefore did not receive clear instructions to observe the homecoming smite gate after arriving in the country and underwent a second screening a few days after arriving in the country..
He was denied entry at the border..
"He is in the Norwegian society and is supposed to be in this kind of treatment,, says Kamilla Jósepsdottir, a specialist in the SARS department of the Landlækne and deputy head of the SARS department while the head of the department is on vacation, in a conversation with the newspaper Fréttablade in the day.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the kennitala and if the kennitala is not registered, he is not automatically invited to the second show.
She says that the man was able to use the English registration form because he is in fact resident abroad, but because of his ties to the country he should have used the Icelandic form.
However, he did not understand it.
"If the kennitalan is not registered, he has to seek it himself in the second test..
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right thing to do,, " says Kamilla.
"In other words, it is clear that information about this must be increased while a way is found to make automatic emergency call systems, even though the Icelanders do not register their identity numbers..
This or that way to make it clear who is involved in the Icelandic society in the registration system,, she explains.
As it turned out, the person was able to overcome the challenges of living in the country, although he is considered to be a participant in the Icelandic society, being an Icelander..
Only six have been sent into quarantine since he was diagnosed the day before, and these six were all in contact with him.
They are still to be tested but two of them are already showing symptoms of the Covid-19 infection..
The man was tested at the border on the 15th of July and received a negative result..
Kamilla says that it is likely that he was recently infected with the virus and that he had not yet been infected when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not rule out the possibility that the man had contracted the disease in Iceland but did not bring it with him to the country.
"It is not possible to say that it is definitely an imported infection because it has been so long since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed to the disease in Norway. "
However, she says that it is very unlikely because of the small number of men with whom he was in contact.
It is, in fact, very unlikely,, says Kamilla, but it is not possible to rule it out until the Institute of Genetics has sequenced the virus in the man.
"If a new strain of the virus is found, it is almost certain that he brought it to the country. "

Solskjær says it is not the game that defines the season.
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the match against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League..
If United loses the game and Chelsea does not lose to Wolves,, Solskjær and his men end up in fifth place and miss out on the Champions League.
Then, they still had a chance to qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League in the next month.
"They are not at the end of the road.
If they get a point against Leicester, people will say that they have not had a bad season, " said Solskjær.
"Whatever happens, this is not the end of their journey, as they still have a long way to go to catch up with the teams above them. " said Solskjær.
It is clear that the nerves of men are stretched by 15 o' clock on that day, but Solskjær tried to make it look like a normal match.
"If a man wants to belong to Manchester United, he has to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new,, and it is based on this..
They have created a fantastic opportunity to end the season well and now it's up to them to take advantage of it " said Solskjær.
"This is not the most important game of the season, it is just the next game.
He can talk to anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The finals do not define the season of the team, they have already had many moments that define this season.
"Koma Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for them and I believe that, overall, they are in a better shape and more mentally strong than in the previous season. " said Solskjær.
65,000 infections per day.

A total of 417,802 cases have been confirmed in the west of the country since the start of the epidemic.

According to a CNN report, the number of deaths caused by the virus is estimated to be 175,000 on 15 August 2018.
Fear a second wave of the epidemic.
The government of Spain is now trying to curb the spread of COVID - 19, which is spreading more widely in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported 920 new cases of the disease on Thursday and Friday.
There have not been more than 100 new cases in one day since the beginning of May and the news comes at the same time as the Spaniards begin to lift one of the strictest travel bans in Europe.
This led to the British authorities forcing passengers arriving from Spain to go into quarantine upon their return.
Viku was previously on the British list of safe countries..
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the north--east of Spain, where the authorities have imposed wide-- ranging restrictions in an attempt to stem the growth.
In the city of Barcelona, nightclubs will be closed for the next two weeks and nightclubs must close at midnight.
A ban on leaving the area is now in effect for 200,000 inhabitants of Seguria in the west of Catalonia..
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the influx of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the aftermath of the flu.
Tui, the largest travel agency in Britain, cancelled all flights scheduled for the day to Spain and the Canary Islands.
The governments of many countries are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but there is little interest in reinstating the widespread ban on outings that has devastated the economy.
For example, Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken a very strong stance against this and similar weapons that he does not want to use.
The Prime Minister of France, Jean Castex has said that the nation " would not be able to survive economically or socially " if the ban was reintroduced.
Many politicians believe that the local emergency measures that reach the inhabitants of individual villages, cities or areas are sufficient to prevent the spread of the virus in the next round.
Five new infections in Iceland - three within the country.
Three domestic infections were detected in the past day, in addition to two more at the border.
In Norway, five individuals were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infection on the same day.
In a statement from the Norwegian Civil Defence, it says that one of the infections is related to the infection detected on the day before at the Rey Cup football tournament.
He has been sent to isolation and the sixteen who were in close proximity to him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social life of a sports club in Reykjavik and according to the announcement, was " only a part of the sports team " in quarantine.
Others who were sent to quarantine were related to the man in other ways..
The origin of the infection is unknown and the tracking of the infection is ongoing by the police's tracking team.
The organizers of the Rey Cup tournament have followed the guidelines and regulations of the State Institute of Disease Prevention and Control and the Ministry of the Interior, which are still in force and have made the necessary arrangements.
However, the pictures of the day before attracted attention because they showed the players celebrating their team's good performance in close proximity to each other on the field.
Just before 11 o'clock on the day, the organizers posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
There is a sign that reads "ATH: Parents are urged to respect the rule that competitors bring their own equipment to the school.
Parents are not allowed to do this.
Thank for the shown understanding.
An additional infection was detected in the previous day, but it is related to the infection detected in the previous day..
In the announcement, " Icelandic genetics has sequenced the infections and discovered a new strain of the virus that has not been found in Iceland before. "
Work is being done on tracing the source of the infection in this case as well, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 people are in quarantine due to the infection.
The third case is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days earlier, on 15 July.
He was located in the southwest of the country.
He is now in isolation and six people who were in close proximity to him during quarantine..
Two of them are already showing signs of being infected with the virus..
In addition, two were detected at the border and are awaiting the results of further surveys, as the surveillance procedure for border smuggling dictates.
At the end of the announcement, the Almannavarnedeild of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health and Welfare urged people to be careful and to take good care of their individual sexually transmitted disease prevention.
There is no certainty that the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, as the same person is being asked to take a test at the next health station..
Patreksfjordur says the camping site is overbooked for the summer holiday - there are fewer visitors than expected.
The campsite in Patreksfjord is full for the weekend, according to an announcement from Vestbyggd.
The audience was advised to look at other accommodation options.
The municipality of Vesturbyggd names Bíldudal, Tálknafjord, Melanes on Rauðsand and Hotel Fløkalund and Hotel Breiðavik as other alternatives in the area.
There is a lot going on in Patreksfjord during this weekend,, because, as in previous years,, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentary films, is held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
It is expected that there will be a good turnout this year, if the weather does not spoil the forecast,, but DV reported earlier in the day that the weather forecast was poor.
However, the worst weather is expected in the south, and there is hope for Patreksfjord..
The newspaper Bb.I said first,, and said that all other accommodation in the city was already full.
It's a six--story apartment building that collapsed on the best site in the city.
Rumanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18-20.
In the meantime, owners are seeking building permits for renovations, which have been stalled in the bureaucracy for three years.
In one of the oldest, most ancient and most expensive neighborhoods of the municipality of Reykjavik, a large multi--story residential building stands.
On the ground floor of the house, there are about 600 square meters of commercial space.
Behind the house, there are two staircases, each of which contain four fairly large apartments..
They are between 93 and 130 square meters, with most over 100.
The house has a rich history.
It was built in 1959 and has also housed a video rental, Skostofana, the Mjölkursamsolen's butter factory, the gunsmith, the fish shop and now the University Press.
The house has, so it is said, lost none of its beauty..
The house now lies in ruins, as can be seen on the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 are Magnus Magnusson and Guðrún Helga Lárusdottir, according to the company register.
Magnus was a member of the Borgun ownership group and was the head of the Borgun ownership group.
In the group of owners of the Borgun company, is the Stálskip company.
Stålskip AS is a shipping company owned by Guðrún Helga Lárusdottir and her children.
Guðrún is also a shareholder in D18 AS.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, ran the shipping company Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in 2009 and has not maintained it since then.
The neighbors say that the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily over the years,, but most noticeably in recent years.
One of the residents of the neighborhood said that the house had " not been particularly lively in the last few years " on the Facebook page of the residents of the neighborhood.
There may also be the possibility that the owners have been trying to change the house and the grounds for a number of years.
The other neighbors say that the house has not been in good condition for a long time.
"It is long overdue for something to be done about this blot and it is unfortunate that it has dragged on for so long.
He also says that he is disappointed with the owners of the house for not driving him to find a common ground with their neighbors and stop this " legal tug of war. "
"To do this, in coordination with the community in the surrounding area, so that it is possible to drive the project and complete it. "
"The planning process " that the inhabitant refers to is the planning process of the area, which has been going on since 2017.
Then, the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 applied for permission to build a new building on top of the existing multi-- story house and behind it, a new lift house and an underground level.
The building permit that was granted for this construction was challenged to the Supreme Court of Norway and the court ruled that the construction was not in accordance with the local development plan and that the preliminary notification was insufficient.
The municipality of Reykjavik then started work on the detailed planning and completed it with an announcement in the Stjornartidindes in July of the previous year.
The same arrangement was also contested and overturned by the court in March 2020.
At that time, three years had passed since the original application for building permission and the owners of the house on the original site.
The house had fallen into disrepair to a considerable extent, and the neighbours were becoming tired of it.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and their reactions, they responded in different ways.
Some understood the owner's intentions, others did not..
Others directed their wrath at the city, others did not.
Others were angry but not out for revenge.
Others said that the parking areas were a source of conflict,, with neighbors using the unused parking areas of Dunhaga 18 – 20 to park their cars.
One of the complainants said that he was tired of the bureaucracy.
"The fact that they have to go through the process three times is absolutely unbelievable.
It is as if the municipality of Reykjavik did not know how to read.
In the present day, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the flights of the city's administration and the grand plans of the owner and many years of their work.
When a reporter arrived at Dunhaga 18, they were greeted by open doors and garbage piles.
The Playstation and the new television lay among other rubbish on the ground - victims of the Norwegian summer mosquitoes.
It was opened in the old office of Håskol Prints and there were a lot of cats with the smell of urine.
It is clear that someone has moved into one of the corners, but no one is visible..
Stacks of couches and mattresses, and a few sheets of geological maps were strewn about.
The stairways of the houses were also open and life was in both of them.
The reporter was lucky enough to meet two of the inhabitants..
There were Romanians cooking their potato soup in the evening meal and invited a journalist to join them.
The Romanians work for the staffing agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and according to DV, the company has not paid for the property except for heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not feasible to collect rent.
From the post offices in the entrance hall, it is clear that there have been a large number of foreign workers there in recent years.
The operation of staff leagues has not been immune from the Covid-19 situation, as the decline in tourism has led to a decline in the construction industry and these two branches have been the most successful in using staff leagues.
In spite of the rain, the men at Dunhaga 18 had plenty to do and hung their overcoats and boots in the common room to dry after a long day's work.
In spite of the poor condition of the house, the apartment shared by the boys appeared to have been well maintained..
When the reporter said goodbye to the Romanian boys, he became suddenly clear that he was at the best place in Reykjavik with a 1,500 square foot property in disrepair.
Owners want to change the house to improve it, and neighbors want to improve the house but disagree on the definition of "improvement.
In between, there is the city's urban planning department, the victim of endless appeals and legal loopholes in the planning process, and the swirling chaos of the court of appeal for environmental and natural resources.
In the house, live Romanian workers, possibly those who will improve the situation when the Icelanders stop fighting..
The article originally appeared in the Sunday edition of DV on 17 July.
In the aftermath of the coronavirus epidemic, a campaign against obesity was launched.
The Prime Minister of Britain, Boris Johnson will give 10 million pounds in a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on advertisements for fast food. after he was seriously ill, partly because of his weight.
Johnson is scheduled to launch the campaign, which has been given the name Better Health, on Monday, but with the campaign, doctors are to be encouraged to prescribe cycling for overweight patients, and there is also to be a campaign to increase the number of cycle paths.
Then, advertisements for fast food restaurants on television will be banned after 21:00 according to British media sources.
" COVID — 19 has awakened them to the danger of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined to use the time to make them healthier, more active and eat healthy food. "
Johnson has himself struggled with weight issues, having been admitted to hospital in the spring of 2011 after contracting a stomach infection. It is partly due to his weight that he is considered to have been so seriously ill.
Women are better suited to lead the changes.
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation could take in the direction of greater distribution of power, greater transparency and in the fight against corruption and the interests of the whole.
"There is a need for a change of gear now, and it is this group of society that is better suited to lead this change than others..
Það is women, " said Helga.
" Women in Iceland are famous for their women's solidarity.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
This means that it is now up to them to lead these changes.
She said that she was somewhat uncomfortable with the emphasis on Iceland as " the best in the world " in both gender equality and human rights.
"Then they are not as prepared to look at what needs to be done..
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
There is a lot of it.
We have to know where they are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listening to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don't live under the same rules here, said Helga.
When asked, she said that women were in good shape in many ways in Iceland, but added that, like in many other places, the Icelanders lived in a very masculine society.
She said that politics revolved around personal interests, dominance and power, which were the forces that perpetuated misrule in all societies.
" Women have now set up this group and come together and they are becoming increasingly frustrated at the fact that the Alþingi is trekking in trek to ignore the 2012 referendum. "
"It is these feminine qualities that they are thinking about..
From the point of view of human rights and nature protection,, cooperation and the fact that everyone sits at the same table,, she said and added that these were the fundamental principles of the new constitution.
"The country is very rich in natural resources and it is incomprehensible that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, they can do it differently,, said Helga.
"It is ridiculous that it is a natural law that women's jobs are always paid less.
It is ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to fight endlessly for wages that are comparable to those of men.
It is possible to sign the underwriting list for the new constitution of the country in Norway through electronic Iceland.

It is possible to stay in the house of Monet during the summer holiday..
The house that the impressionist painter Claude Monet lived in for the last 40 years of his life is now available for rent on the Airbnb website..
The next vacant nights in the house are during the summer holiday.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy in France.

In the house there are three sleeping rooms, two sitting rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house..
If someone wants to rent the house, he must rent it for at least two nights.

Tugir are in quarantine and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus in Norway in the last three days and most of the infected are not related.
Tugir are in quarantine because of this, and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people were diagnosed with the coronavirus in the country on the previous day and two at border checkpoints.
A specialist at the Ministry of Health says that the increasing number of domestic transmissions does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading wider in society.
"It has been analyzed from the first domestic infection and it is a virus that has not been seen in Norway before, so there is no reason to believe that it has been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that is new to the country, but they have to be on high alert now., said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdottir, a specialist on the SARS department of the Ministry of Health.
The majority of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
More tests are to be carried out in the coming weeks, but some of those who were in contact with the infected are now showing symptoms of the coronavirus..
"Now, there is no influenza epidemic, and there are fewer cases of other respiratory diseases, so that it is possible to be a little more liberal with this test on individuals who were found to have a reason to do something else first during the flu epidemic. " said Kamilla.
Smitrakning is mostly completed, but it is not out of the question that more people will have to go into quarantine..
Two of the infected were identified after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions about whether it is acceptable to hold such events.
The head of the Norwegian Civil Defense Agency says that it is possible as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says that it is almost impossible for the infected to have contracted the infection at sporting events.
"If there are not more people in isolation from these individuals after having been in contact with them at these sporting events, it is possible to claim that their isolation measures have been effective.
It is not clear, " said Kamilla.
The verification of the Almannavarndeild is under constant scrutiny.
"We have to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems necessary. " said Kamilla.
After about a week, the limit of 1,000 people is to be increased.
This new position may have an impact on the easing of restrictions.

Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle.
The municipal authorities of Seattle in the state of Washington have declared a state of emergency in the wake of large--scale protests in the city center.
The police used tear gas and pepper spray to try to clear a large area of protesters that stretched over several blocks of the city..
The police announced on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into damage caused to a police station in the city on the previous day, possibly by a grenade.
The police and security forces say that the protesters threw rocks, bottles, explosives and other objects at the police, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where he was treated for injuries.

Not rescinded until after the vote.
It is not yet clear whether the dismissals of the Icelandair flight attendants, which are to come into effect in the next month, will be revoked.
The electronic voting for the Icelandair flight attendants's contract on behalf of the Icelandair flight attendants's union ends at midday on the following day.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the chairman of the union, says that she is certain that Icelandair will not make a decision on the dismissals until the vote has taken place.
"It is clear that it is connected, " says Guðlaug Líney.
" There have been no cancellations reinstated, this has to be done in such a way that the planes can be manned.
And people are also desperate to find out whether they will have a job after the end of the month.
A vote was made on a contract that was signed the previous week, on the night of 19 July.
It is expected that it will last until the end of September 2025 and is based on a previous agreement that flight attendants had previously voted to reject.
On 17 July, the board and the executive committee of the Icelandic Airwomen's Association voted to call for a general strike at Icelandair, and the members of the association voted for it in a vote.
Til her came never, but this was decided in the wake of Icelandair's decision to terminate negotiations with the flight attendants' union, to dismiss all of its flight attendants and to seek agreements with another labor union.
Then, the airmen of the company were to take on the role of security personnel on board on a temporary basis..
It is difficult to predict how the vote will go, says Guðlaug Líney.
" People are still in pain after the Icelandair attack,, when all of the airline's flight attendants were fired and it was announced that a new union agreement would be made with another union.
It becomes clear that it has an effect, " she says.
940 flight attendants worked at Icelandair at the end of April, with 900 of them, about 95 percent, being laid off.
The termination notice of those who have the shortest working life is three months and ends at the end of the months of July and August.
In this group, 90% are flight attendants of Icelandair.
What will happen if the agreement is not accepted.
"They want to continue negotiations with their partners.
With this agreement, Icelandair is meeting the demands of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants have gone too far.
The vote on the labor agreement is over and Icelandair will announce the results of the first quarter of the year the next day.
The vote of the flight attendants on the new contract will end at 12 o'clock on the morning of the next day.
The results of Icelandair for the second quarter will also be published on the morning, but preliminary results indicate that the company's revenue fell by 85 percent compared to the same period in the previous year.
The electronic voting on the Icelandair agreement between the Icelandic Pilots' Association and the Association of the Icelandic Industry started on Wednesday 22 July and ended on Monday 27 July at 12 o'clock in the morning.
Those who are allowed to vote on the agreement are employees of Icelandair who pay membership fees to the Flight Attendants' Association.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective agreement on the night of 19 July, after the airline broke off negotiations with the union after flight attendants rejected the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had dismissed all its flight attendants and pilots on Friday, but they were reinstated after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to the new collective agreement, flight attendants have to fly five more hours per month for the same salary.
The contract is valid until 2025, but it has been amended to include provisions for flight attendants and flight attendants about how long they can fly on one shift.
The agreement was introduced to the members of FFÍ at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel the previous Monday and many of the flight attendants interviewed by the news agency were unhappy with the agreement.
Most agreed that they would have to accept the agreement in order to keep the union alive.
Uppgjör for Icelandair for the second quarter is to be announced on the morning of the day, but the company's EBIT, its operating profit, for the first three months of the year, is minus 100 to 110 million US dollars or 15 billion Norwegian krones.
Icelandair sent the Court of Appeal a provisional revenue estimate of 60 million USD or 83 million Norwegian krones for the quarter.
Handbært goods and goods of the same value amounted to 154 million US dollars at the end of the quarter, around 21 billion Norwegian krones.
Icelandair is also planning to offer shares in the company in August.
Icelandair is aiming to finalize contracts with 15 airline partners, the government and Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month prior to the launch of the tender for shares.
A new strain of the virus rather than a new species of the virus.
"The new strain means that it was an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been occurring in Norway, " says Már Kristjánsson, head of the infectious diseases ward of the Landspitals, about the news that " a new strain of the virus " has been found in Norway.
Three domestic infections were detected and two at the border.
One of those who was infected had taken part in a football tournament called the Rey Cup,, but the source of the infection has not been found and the tracing of the infection is still ongoing.
Also, a person who came to the country on 15 July was infected, and two people who were in contact with him began to show symptoms of COVID - 19.
Then it was discovered that the infection was related to the infection discovered the day before, and after genetic analysis at the Norwegian Institute of Genetics, a new strain of the virus was discovered that had not been found in Norway before.
Smitrakning is completed in connection with the smit.
Már states that it is not a new virus, that it is the same virus that has spread all over the world,, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS- CoV 2.
It is more accurate to talk about a new strain of the virus rather than a new species of the virus.
He is asked what it means and whether it can say anything about the start of a second wave of the disease and says that as things stand, it is a single incident and that it may not go any further.
"However, if there are cases in the country that are not related to foreign sources and have the same arfgerð as this particular variant,, it would be possible to draw the conclusion that there is a second wave, but it is premature at this stage,, explains Már.
Happiness in the hot pot.
The secret of the happiness of the Icelanders is hidden in the hot baths.
The programme makers of the BBC lead to the conclusion that the swimming pool and hot pot culture of the country is like a joke in a funny video.
Icelandic bath culture is unique in the world and it is claimed that there are more bath houses per inhabitant in Iceland than anywhere else in the world.
The natural geothermal heat is the basis for this,, but also the tradition for swimming.
Children's education was mandated by law in 1940, but older citizens are not less eager to use the hot water for their own health..
Sailing is described as an integral part of the general welfare of the nation.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and status.
People talk to each other on a personal level about home and abroad or enjoy the healing power of the water, contemplating and recharging their souls and bodies..
It is difficult to win 100 days in the elections.
100 days are until the Americans go to the election and choose their president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he is on the back foot.
Biden is ahead of Trump in the polls on a national basis, according to opinion surveys.
According to a new survey by the Associated Press news agency, a large number of Americans believe that the country is on the wrong path.
The response of Trump to the new worldwide epidemic of the new coronavirus is also very unpopular and more Americans than before believe that the president has mismanaged the economy.
Nine out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right path.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the outbreak and 48 percent say he has handled the economy well.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average of Five Thirty Eight, Biden has 49.9 percent of the vote nationally and 41.9 percent for Trump.
Trump himself has tried to divert attention away from his failure in dealing with the outbreak to the so-called culture clash and to promote policies based on laws and regulations.
Biden's campaign is putting a lot of emphasis on keeping the focus on Trump and saying that he has a good chance of winning if the election is decided on the basis of how he has performed in the last four years.
The popularity of Trump also appears to be falling among members of the Republican Party, and it is feared that the Democrats could even gain a majority in the United States Senate,, which until now has been considered unlikely.
The Politico reported on the days that the party's and the candidate's support would be similar to what it is now,, and that the Republican Party would suffer its worst defeat in a century.
Uthverfi has proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now the trend is continuing.
Trump has, in recent days, tried to frighten the inhabitants of the outlying areas to follow him,, among other things, by saying that if Biden becomes president, he would destroy the outlying areas of the United States and stir up racial tensions.
Among other things, Trump has overturned a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He then urged " housewives " in the outlying areas of the United States to read a column by Biden's predecessor as governor of New York, in which she claimed that Biden would destroy the outlying areas of the United States and took him to task for it.
" Biden will destroy their neighborhoods and the American dream.
The president said that he would preserve it, and even make it better.
The inhabitants of the outlying areas of the United States are a growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who received the most votes from this group has become president.
In 2012, Mitt Romney received more votes from this group than Barack Obama but lost to Obama.
Polls have shown that, despite Trump's narrow majority in the outlying areas in 2016, his support there has fallen dramatically.
Tho there are differences between the canvassers, Biden has been estimated to have a 15 percent advantage over Trump in the outlying areas in recent canvasses.

The Olympic Stadium will be the light at the end of the runway.
After the final decision was made to postpone the Olympic Games, a sporting event that has only been affected by world wars until now,, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic flame would be " the light at the end of the road " and referred to the worldwide spread of the coronavirus that the world is now going through in unity.
The athletes have a year and a half to prepare for the postponement, and the Japanese authorities have to spend more money because of the postponement.
All of them, however, hold on to the house, because they have a lot of money in it.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympic Games in 1964, the Japanese delegation's celebrations were muted.
They cried and shouted alternately, and in the end Tokyo had applied to host the games in 2016 but lost out to Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were bathing in the attention of the world.
The games were originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August but were postponed by a year and started on 23 July 2021 and ended on 8 August.
If it is not possible to hold the games, if the coronavirus is still too dangerous, the games will be cancelled.
But no one wants to think about it to the end.
The Olympic Games are no ordinary athletic competition.
There is nothing to spare, the show is always meant to be spectacular and is trying to top the previous one.
The selection of the host city for the Olympic Games is based on the assessment of the bidding cities by the selection committee.
The more spectacular the presentation, the greater the likelihood of winning the prize.
Tókýó defended 150 million dollars to try to hold the Olympic Games in 2016, which is equivalent to 20 million Norwegian krones.
In the second time,, when they applied for the 2020 Olympics, they invested 75 million dollars, 10 billion Norwegian krones in the promotion.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the Games in 2020,, the Japanese government had allocated 300 million krones to the project.
The amount is, however, only a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build the Olympic village, stadiums and other infrastructure to host the Games, to prepare for the Games and to hold the Games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which had been scheduled to take place that day but had been postponed by one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 126 million dollars.
In a report from the state auditor of Japan, which was published at the end of the year,, however, it was stated that the actual cost was twice as high.
It is likely that it will not be possible to determine the exact cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars on top of the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could be as high as 150 to 300 million dollars.
There are so high numbers that all of Norway's tax revenues would only cover about half of the cost of hosting the Olympics, at the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have frequently been the subject of analysis by economists, who have attempted to determine the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, it seems that many have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games is not positive for the economy of the cities that host them.
Short- term effects are some,, for example, the number of jobs increases dramatically in the short term, but in the long term cities tend to be burdened with debt and high operating costs of unused buildings.
The city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil is sitting on huge debts due to the 2016 Games and has struggled to maintain the large sporting facilities built for the Games.
This has been scrutinized after the London 2012 Olympics, where it was revealed that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
It means that there were no new jobs, except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not come out well financially from hosting the Olympics due to the heavy costs associated with the construction of the facilities for the games.
However, there is often considered to be an advantage in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities in the wake of the games, but there is great uncertainty about this for the 2021 games.
It is also unclear whether it will be possible to accommodate all of the large number of spectators who normally attend the games.
However, the main thing is the honor of being chosen, which is difficult to assess in terms of money.
In spite of the enormous costs, it is also possible to say that the joy that the games bring is not of the same nature as to be able to put a price on it.
However, the show is often spectacular and no expense is spared,, but it is not only about money.
It is the athletes who are in the foreground.
For some of the elite athletes, the postponement of the games is only beneficial.
The Australian pentathlon athlete and gold medalist in her event at the Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, single and was not in good shape in the summer but hopes to be in competitive form for the 2021 Olympic Games.
She is one of the athletes who is happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after the Games,, the postponement of the Games in some cases meant that they were able to retire before the Games took place..
He does not believe that his body is strong enough to go through another year of strenuous training..
Few athletes captured the hearts of the audience at the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 as much as the gymnast Simone Biles..
She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has appeared in several interviews in her home country of the United States to discuss the Olympic Games.
She intends to participate in the 2021 Olympics, but she is not certain that she will be on top in the 2012 Olympics, since she is now 24 years old.
Although it is not generally considered to be a high age, it is in the top rank for a female gymnast.
"It's a sensitive issue, " Biles says, but smiles anyway in an interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page about whether she intends to achieve the same level of success in London 2012 as she did in Rio 2016.
" I don't know whether she will be on the top of the podium after a year of additional training, " Biles says.
She has previously said that her body is no longer able to cope with the stress of gymnastics.
However, she is still training hard for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop training suddenly when the recession was at its peak and the gymnastics facility was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles as opposed to other athletes during the seven- week closure of all athletic facilities.
All of her Olympic gold medals could not buy her any access beyond that,, she had to find various ways to keep herself in shape.
The basic form is certainly better than that of most people.
"They have a tough schedule now.
It was difficult to start training again after the gymnastics hall opened.
I started slowly but is coming on full throttle as the year progresses and is going to increase the number of training sessions as the year progresses..
They do not know exactly how these games will take place or whether they will be held, but they are preparing for the possibility that they will be held..
He has put too much pressure on himself to leave the sport now. "
With her, and others, there is a sense that the possibility of the games not being held in 2021 is not out of the question.
It is impossible to predict what will happen.
No one knows how the situation with the worldwide epidemic of the coronavirus will be in July 2021, and the only thing to do is to prepare for the Olympic Games, based on the assumption that they would be held in 2021.
Maybe the Olympic Stadium will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel..
The wedding was postponed due to the epidemic.
The Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams in the summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now,, " the actress said in an interview with People.
" They want to get married as soon as possible and have a dream wedding with all their close friends.
They decided to postpone it and focus on what is important now, and that is to help spread information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
He is more interested in world affairs than wedding arrangements at the moment.
There is a lot going on and attention should be focused on what is happening in the world..
