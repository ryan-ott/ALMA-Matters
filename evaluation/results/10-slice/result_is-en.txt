Cried out to the world
The marketing campaign "Looks Like You Need Iceland" is said to have gotten off to a good start, and the howls of the wolves in the wilderness are starting to attract people from all over the world.
"They have the collar, I need Iceland," says a woman from somewhere in the world in the comment section of the advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
An onlooker says that he will keep Iceland in his heart forever, and a young woman says that she will go to Iceland as soon as possible because her boyfriend lives there.
Unluckily, she is in the United States and will therefore have to wait for a few more months..
Yet another spectator asks whether the path to Iceland is open, since there are no planes.
It is not known whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson from the advertising agency Peel, which was involved in the creation of the advertisements together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says that the response has exceeded expectations.
I was involved in many of the Inspired by Iceland campaigns that have been very successful,, but this new campaign is already breaking records.
At its core, this is about creating PR value, that is, getting foreign media to cover the campaign,, and that has gone unbelievably well.
In a relatively short time, they have received coverage in over 700 media outlets around the world, reaching more than two billion people.
The value of the coverage is estimated at 1.8 billion krones.
It is not unpleasant.
The main market for the campaign is the United States, and it has gone very well there, despite the fact that Americans are not on their way to the country..
According to Egil, known markets such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also taken well to themselves, as has Russia, which came as a pleasant surprise.
Then there were reactions from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically targeted.
"These advertisements have traveled further than we expected, " says Egill, but it must be noted that more than four million people have watched the material on YouTube.
"We could not have asked for a better start.. "
The pictures here were taken by Morgunblaðen's photographer, Arni Sæberg, during filming of advertisements with the slogan "Let It Out" in mid- last month.
Filming took place all over Iceland, including on Skólavörðustíg in Reykjavík, at Reynisfjara, at Skógafoss, at Sólheimajökli and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cameraman was Óttar Guðnason.
In the aforementioned scenes, the Icelandic actress Anna Jia and the Cuban- American Murphy Cardenas, who is from Hungary, appeared.
Hundreds of Icelanders were involved in the making of the advertisements, at the same time as filming took place in South Iceland, another group was working in West Iceland and the Westfjords.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first phase of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, with a winter campaign planned in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for Íslandsstofa, " Egill says, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone very well.
"It's fantastic to work with them.
In these types of projects, it is crucial to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets they are talking to.

And this is how she looks today, 25 years later.
The actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in young people's shows.
However, she achieved international fame for her role as Amber in the 1995 film Clueless. 25 years ago.
She also appeared in Sabrina the Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Lately, not much has been heard of her, but she did give an interview about Clueless on Australian television a few days ago.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, and says she was a wonderful person..
"I have to admit that I based the character on girls he met in school who were not good to him.
As soon as he read the script, he knew who this character was," Donovan said about his role in Clueless.
He did not want to leave the police station after spending the night there.
Around fifty cases came to the attention of the police in the greater Copenhagen area on this day, and according to the police's daily log, the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to deal with a man who had just been released from the detention cell after having been detained there due to drunken driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey police orders to leave..
The man was allowed to stay at the police station because of his behaviour.
In the morning, a man was arrested on suspicion of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to deal with two men in Breiðholt because of reports of physical assault.
In addition, a woman who was eating a meal in a shopping center in Kópavogur was not able to pay for the bill at the end of the meal and was called to the police.
Also, a car was stolen in the city centre in the morning.
The driver of a white Renault delivery van was missing for a short time and was then taken by force.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Gleestars - The horrible fate of the Gleestars
This theory has taken flight on the Internet, that the curse of the Glee cast has claimed the life of the show's third lead actor, Naya Rivera, who drowned in California a few days ago.
The Glee series is popular for its singing, dancing and joy.
The series focused on the lives of a group of teenagers in a high school, their love affairs and their fates.
It wasn't always taken out with the joy of being in the band, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the show seemed to overcome the obstacles that arose in their lives.
Outside of the shooting location, great tragedies have befallen the actors and crew of the series, to the extent that rumors have arisen that the series is cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez on the show, a cheerleader who was not afraid to speak her mind.
After the series had run its course, Rivera went on to marry the actor Ryan Dorsey and had her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they separated as a result.
However, Dorsey declined to press charges and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On 8 July last year, it was announced that Riveru was missing after her four--year old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket aboard the boat and was able to tell police that he and his mother had gone for a swim and that Rivera had brought him back to the boat, but never returned herself.
A major search was launched for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the chief of police for the area announced that it was assumed that Rivera had drowned during the search.
Five days later, Rivera's body was found and she was officially declared dead.
It is believed that she was caught in a strong current in the water and used her last strength to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded as drunkenness.
Cory Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Glee Club to prominence.
Outside of the show, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and it was difficult to get away from it.
In 2013, his co--stars in the series had had enough and intervened, urging him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed to be on the road to recovery.
Only two months after completing treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to celebrate with friends.
The mixture of drugs and alcohol was lethal.
It was not considered to be a case of deliberate sabotage.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance for drugs had diminished so much that a dose that he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
The death of his co--star, Lea Michele, had a heavy impact on his colleagues, but thanks to her influence, it was decided to continue the series and dedicate a whole episode to Moneith and his character, Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow Glee Club members until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of child pornography.
During a search of his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found and the matter quickly became public..
It was clear that Salling was finished.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his crimes.
He was sentenced to between four and seven years in prison, as well as having to register as a sex offender and seek treatment for pedophilia.
Before the sentence was pronounced, Salling, who was out on bail at the time, was found near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors in the show who died long before their time..
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the series.
He died suddenly in his sleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
Also working on the show was a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the big star Julia Roberts and did not have a good story to tell about her sister, accusing her of being domineering and disrespectful.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her husband in which she blamed her mother and sisters for what had happened to her.
His mother and so--called siblings get nothing from him but the memory of causing his worst depression..
Lea Michele was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and abusing her co--stars on the set and having an overbearing star syndrome.
Jesse Luken guest starred in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunken driving in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
In 2010, she was the victim of hackers who stole nude photographs of her and posted them on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the series and were in a relationship outside of the series.
Bonoist later revealed that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
It is possible to put flowers on almost everything.
It enhances the development of children when they are allowed to play outside in the garden with their parents, to cultivate flowers and watch them grow..
It is also possible to do endlessly with flowers, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just being able to spend time with the children in the garden is something that is never forgotten..
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and of course the precious time they spent with their parents..
Bought a boat after tenth grade.
"I don't think there are many fishermen who work in daycare centres in Iceland, " says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who works as a fisherman during the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.
Strandveiðing is a very comfortable summer job when one is studying..
If the fishing is good, it is possible to earn a good income and it is fantastic to be able to give up taking student loans.
The income from the summer is also enough to get him through the winter, says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year old psychology student who fishes in the summer like he has done in previous summers.
Axel had just docked at Tálknafjörð when a newspaper reporter managed to talk to him late at night at the beginning of the week.
In the winter when he was in tenth grade, he took his boat captain's license for boats under 12 meters and bought his boat the summer after he finished high school.
I have fished for lobster on his boat every summer since.
He bought the boat from a friend, Hartmann Jónsson, and he named the boat after him.
Hartmann was already an adult when I bought the boat and he was no longer going to sea, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after Axel took over the ship,, says Axel, who bought the ship for three million.
I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half of it, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when he was finished fishing.
He had the boat debt- free at the end of his first summer on it.
And a young man with one and a half million krones in his pocket when he had just finished secondary school.
"I had been saving up and collecting money, he had been working with his father at sea when he was a boy, he had been fishing with him all summer and got his share..
He also put his confirmation money into his sailing fund.
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his mother's family is from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
"I can fish here in the west because he has a residence permit with his grandmother in Isafjordur.
I learned to row on these waters from his father..
I move from fjord to fjord depending on how he feels, because this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although he prefers to fish in the west, he has also fished in the area around Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
I've also fished for salmon in the south, but that was mainly for trout,," says Axel, who always goes out fishing early in the morning and says that he sometimes talks to the gulls and sings to the sky in solitude for hours on the open sea.
The internet connection out at sea is good, so he can call, listen to radio shows and listen to music.
I don't mind being alone in a boat.
Of course, he tries to avoid getting into trouble, but occasionally something has gone wrong, but never anything serious. Axel is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing is going at the time.
"In the trawl fishing, he is never more than 14 hours at sea at a time, but he has also been fishing in other areas, for example in the leased quota, where he has been out at sea for 1.5 days at a time fishing in the trawl. "
He says that the regulations for coastal fishing allow him to catch 770 kilograms a day, which he finds restrictive.
Other restrictions are that he is not allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and that he is only allowed to fish for 12 days a month during the four months of strandveiða, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to row instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to choose as they like..
In the same way, the regional division could also go in my favor, and coastal fishing ports that are well located in fishing grounds should be allowed to benefit from this,, says Axel, who mainly fishes cod from the salty sea on his coastal fishing trips, but also a few other species float with him.
Axel works over the winter with his university studies at the Núpi kindergarten in Kópavogur.
"I don't think there are many sailors who work in daycare centers in Norway, " says Axel proudly and adds that he had only planned to work temporarily at the daycare center.
"I got stuck there because he thought it was an amazing job.
I hope that the psychology degree will be useful to him on the preschool level in the future," says Axel, who also has a degree in business economics.
The listing of the villa prevented homecomings from being screened.
In the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country, the villa was the reason why a person who was living in the country was not called back for a re-test.
There is no obligation to register with a kennital number if the person fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
This will be examined in the coming week, says a specialist at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Three domestic infections were detected on the virology department of Landspitalan on the previous day.
One of those who tested positive arrived in the country on the 15th of July, two days after the regulations for so-called homecoming quarantine took effect.
Those who are resident in Iceland are then screened upon their arrival to the country and again called in for testing four to five days later.
According to RÚV's noon news, the person in question had followed the old system..
The screening at the border was negative and he was not called back for a second screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in the Department of Communicable Diseases at the Ministry of Health, said in an interview with the news agency that this was due to a mistake in the electronic registration sheet.
Fill in the registration forms in English is not a requirement to put in a kennital number, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
After all, it was first and foremost intended for foreign tourists.
The person in question did not receive an automatic invitation to take a sample..
Kamilla says that many have followed up on the homecoming quarantine regulations, even though they filled out the registration forms in English and in some cases, employers have also been vigilant about sending people back for re-testing after they arrived in the country.
"This will be looked at in the coming week to see how to make it easier for people to get access to this and to raise awareness of the process.. "
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all went for a test but two were showing symptoms.
Smit tracing is ongoing for the three cases identified on Thursday, but it is mostly finished for the two cases identified on Friday.
In both cases, DNA sequencing by the Icelandic Institute of Genetics has revealed that there are new strains of the coronavirus that have not been found in Iceland before.
In the second case, the focus has been on Israel, though it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries..
Kamilla says that it would be clear on the next day where the other virus was coming from.
There are now 15 people in isolation according to the website Covid. is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four of the five infections were unrelated.
Five domestic transmissions have occurred in the country in recent days.
Of the four, four are completely unrelated and, for example, they have not been able to find the origin of the infection that broke out at the Rey Cup sports tournament on the previous day.
Identification is still ongoing..
Originally, there were 20 exceptionally sent in quarantine, but they were reduced to 16.
In total, 34 people are in isolation due to the new infections detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that an infection has been detected at an athletic event and has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jöhann K. Jóhannsson, communications officer for the Almannavarnir Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior, says that it is possible, as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
"We are constantly reminding all those who live here that it is necessary to maintain individual hygiene.
We also need to remind people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that they need to follow.
Then it is possible to hold events."
He says that it is possible to prevent the spread of the infection by maintaining individual hygiene.
Rules and guidelines are also in a constant state of review.
What needs to be done, and what the Almannavarnir and the Landlæsse embassy are constantly urging people to do, is to take care of these individual infection prevention measures.
Both at home and at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use sprays.
It prevents the spread of infection," says Jóhann.
"We need to encourage people to continue on the good path they were on, in order to be able to maintain the success they have achieved so far.. "
40% of the victims of COVID-19 were suffering from diabetes 2.
Devon Brumfield heard through the phone how difficult it was for her father to breathe.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was killed.
The death was attributed to acute respiratory distress caused by a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as the underlying cause and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same fate awaits him..
The Reuters news agency says that Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
The results of a new study commissioned by US authorities show that nearly 40% of those who died were suffering from type 2 diabetes as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who have not reached the age of 65 is considered, the proportion rises to half.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveyed more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in infectious diseases at the CDC, says the results are striking, especially for those who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
Reuters carried out a survey and the results from the 12 countries that responded showed similar proportions.
Ten states, including California, Arizona and Colombia, have not yet reported underlying diseases.
" Diabetes was a disease in an epidemic phase.
Now, COVID - 19 has broken through like a powerful tsunami, " according to Reuters, Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also suffered worse from the coronavirus.
The best defense for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease in check with exercise, a healthy diet, and the help of health care professionals.
However, the coronavirus epidemic has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
Then, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue to go to work and stop exposing themselves to the virus..
Reuters reports that US authorities were aware of the danger posed by the virus to those with type 2 diabetes.
In 2003, during the SARS coronavirus epidemic, more than 20% of those affected were hospitalized, and in the 2009 swine flu epidemic, this group was three times more likely to be hospitalized.
When MERS broke out in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
According to Charles S. Dela Cruz, a virologist at Yale University,, because the effects of the COVID-19 virus may last longer, the epidemic has revealed a number of previously unknown complications.
"I fear that there will be a flood of diabetes problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus epidemic could indirectly lead to an increase in complications associated with diabetes, such as kidney disease and kidney failure.
In addition, new research suggests that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in the number of cases of diabetes.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weakened by diabetes.
Then, a high proportion of glucose and lipids in the blood of diabetics can trigger a true "immune storm" as it is called when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body.
Damaged intestinal epithelial cells can also lead to the formation of bubbles, which in turn can cause life--threatening blood clots.
"This is all one big jigsaw puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"All of this is interconnected."
The article has been corrected..
They were offered champagne and then they left the room.
The couple, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason, accepted the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work he was setting up in Paris.
"They loved each other so much that it was not complicated. "
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
He was very impressed by her.
It was the natural glow, but I also thought she was unbelievably cute.
And it is still so,, he says.
Ásrún remembers this too, as her husband often reminds her of the first time they met.
"I'm always hearing this story.
Last weekend, " she says, who was also attracted to her husband at first sight.
I found and still find that there is a lot of hype around Atli, which I likes.
There is a lot going on and a lot happening, and I was fascinated by that..
Atli says that the couple have emphasized the importance of going their own way in their relationship.
"We do not tie their knots the same way as their fellow travellers.
They avoid routines that they identify in their surroundings.
It is possible that they took the request from Ragnar Kjartansson, the artist, with enthusiasm, even though it was quite unusual.
"Kirsten Anna, a common friend of theirs contacts them and asks if they can come to dinner with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg, Ragnar's wife, at Snaps. "
They accepted the invitation, met with the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and their own after--dinner drinks.
They listened to Ragnar as he led them through his plans for a fall art exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris.
He had a series of video works called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in simple terms.
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he intended to shoot, and lastly he told us that he wanted to know whether they were interested in taking part in them. "
Senan, which Ragnar asked the couple to take part in, was supposed to show young middle- class couples falling in love in a minimalist apartment.
"This is sexual intercourse with a beginning and an end," says Atli.
The couple knew Ragnar little, though they knew of him and he of them " but they knew them and thought they would fit in.
They said that they did not want to advertise for people.
Perhaps they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who would get sexual pleasure from performing for others. "
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"When they walked out of Snap, they said, " We're in this for the long haul.
This was just the way it was.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and the whole team," says Ásrún and Atli agree.
"It's about love and intimacy."
Senan was filmed in a fine apartment on Mýrargata..
There was a very small film crew; the cameraman Ragnar, the sound man and the couple..
After the tape was turned on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún..
"We had not decided anything about how they should be.
They got some small instructions, but they tried to forget time and place.
To be unaware of what they were doing and for whom.
It was not played, they just loved each other, so it was not complicated," says Ásrún.
It was romantic.
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli and Ásrún agrees.
They were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on holiday in a nice hotel in Paris.
The team was pleased with the couple's performance in the piece, which moved them.
"When Tommi the cameraman saw this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
"This is as much about love and intimacy as it is about the act of sex itself,, " says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice of the son at the National Museum of Reykjavik and then realized that he was part of the work.
Then she turns around and starts to think about it," says Atli.
"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris..
They had not told anyone this before, but then dad sent me a message and said: It was fun to run into the little family in the Palais de Tokyo..
And the participation in the play may have deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli.
"At least they are still together, so maybe it deepened it a bit.
This at least deepened her relationship with her in--laws," says Ásrún and laughs.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleagues.
"It was difficult for me not to be with him, but with someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
"But it was fun to see it, because it was just one scene in a much larger work, and when you saw it with the other works, it was very impressive..
I was able to distance himself from this a little bit and was proud.
And there was a little bun in my belly," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with her second child at the time the scene was filmed.
"It was just beautiful. "
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with Ásrúnu and Atla in the Rás 1 radio show "Astarsögur".

The embassy was without an ambassador for five years from 2009.
Jeffery Gunter Ross, the US ambassador to Iceland, is in the limelight after CBS reported in the morning that he wanted to hire an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.
It has not always been easy for the President of the United States to appoint ambassadors to Iceland.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as ambassador of the United States in April 2009, the country has been without an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst stepped down under unusual circumstances, Kastljos reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falcon Order.
On the way to the farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a telephone call from the President's office informing her that she would not be awarded the honour..
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at the U.S. Army War College.
Sixteen months passed before Van Voorst's successor took office in September 2010.
To some extent, this can be attributed to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador but then withdrew.
Finally, Louis Ariega took over the job, having worked in the foreign service for over a decade.
He resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador in Guatemala.
Then followed another period without an ambassador.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015 and took up his post shortly afterwards, after 13 months without an ambassador.
Barber was politically appointed but not diplomatic, having worked as a lawyer for Barack Obama's election campaign.
He resigned from his post when Donald Trump took office as president on 20 January 2017, as is customary for politically appointed ambassadors.
The Trump administration was unusually long in appointing both ambassadors and high--ranking officials in the Washington bureaucracy..
Two years later, the United States Congress called Jeffrey Ross Gunter to its committee to question him and confirm his appointment as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony to parliament, he said that he had never been to Iceland, but that his wife, who is now deceased, was of Dutch origin.
Gunter is politically appointed, was previously a plastic surgeon in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, but Adelson is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, when there had been no ambassador to the country since early 2017, for two years and four months.
The reason for this is both the length of time it took for Trump's administration to nominate people to key positions, as well as the fact that in recent years, the work of the United States Congress, including confirming ambassadors, has dragged on.
Since 2009, it has been without an ambassador in Iceland for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the embassy from carrying out projects, as it recently opened its new headquarters at Engjateigur.
The construction is estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion, and the building is surrounded by bulletproof walls and bulletproof glass in all windows.
It does not seem to have been enough to satisfy the current ambassador's sense of security, as he is said to fear for his life and has requested armed bodyguards.
A former player of ÍBV was subjected to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former player of ÍBV, says that he experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This was reported by Tonny in an interview with the Ugandan media outlet Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC, who play in the top division of Uganda..
In an interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland, where he played for ÍBV, Val and Þróttur.
"When he came to Iceland, he didn't play in the middle like he was used to.
The team's captain was in that position, but he was also wearing the jersey number that I wanted, so I didn't get both of those things. said Tonny, who played on the right wing for ÍBV during the season.
Among other things, Tonny talks about racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
This happened to me once, but because he didn't understand the language, he ignored what was said to him.
Latterly, he learned of the case and then asked his friend what it was about.
He told me that his opponent had made racist remarks about him after he tackled him.
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he made the mistakes that he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to break into the starting line-up at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
He then asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he then joined Val.
It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had stayed longer in Norway, I would have got the opportunity that I wanted," says Tonny, who hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would go further.
He believes that the loan to Iceland put an end to his dreams of playing for a big club in Europe.
A worm was found in the throat of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in the throat of a woman who sought treatment there.
The doctors managed to pull the worm out with a tong.
A study revealed that it was a parasite.
CNN reports this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which are thin slices of raw meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi became popular in the West, cases of parasites being transmitted to humans have increased, according to CNN.
Fearing that another wave is about to start in Europe.
Spain is now in the limelight in connection with concerns about the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where governments have taken action to curb the spread of the second wave of the epidemic.
In Catalonia, all leisure activities have been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are on the rise.
Other European countries have also taken action due to the increase in the number of infections in Spain, and in the United Kingdom, all travellers returning from Spain are required to go into quarantine, as in Norway, and France has warned against travel to Spain.
Smit is also spreading again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between limiting the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to other parts of the world, as the number of new infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 per day, with the highest number of infections in the Americas and South Asia.
The number of confirmed cases worldwide is 16 million, according to a count by the Johns Hopkins University, and the number of deaths attributed to the virus is 644,000.
Gert's mosaic work finally gets to shine.
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavík, there is a large and deep hole.
Underneath them are men wearing orange helmets.
There is also a large excavation.
And more smaller work vehicles.
The road is closed to traffic.
The pavement is smooth and many people stop there to admire the artwork made of millions of mosaic tiles - as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they had never seen it before.
At the very least, he did not consider it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, it was directly in front of it, there were parking spaces that were always occupied.
People parked their cars there, locked them up in a hurry, and then dashed off to attend to their business in the city center..
"lively and varied public spaces" and " an attractive urban atmosphere " are the guiding principles for the redevelopment of Tryggvagata, which is currently underway.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerða Helgadóttir at the Customs House to be seen better.
In front of the work, there will be a square, and since the area is well exposed to the sun, it is thought to be suitable as a rest area for travellers.
The artwork is lit up and now the material gets to shine better on the 142 square meters.
In addition, there are also small " fog sculptures ", which are a kind of water sculptures that offer play and provide the area with a certain mysticism.
In this way, Reykjavíkurborg describes the renovations as being carried out in cooperation with Veitur.
Wastewater, water and electricity pipes will be renewed.
Many of them are over 100 years old, but the sewage and cold water pipes were installed in 1925 and have therefore served the residents and businesses in the city centre for nearly a century.
When the road is reopened after the completion of the works, cars will be able to drive on it again.
However, it will be a one--way street and at the same time it will create a more peaceful and accessible space for pedestrians.
According to the tollhouse's official website, the building was opened in 1971 and was designed by Gísli Halldórsson.
Becuase the harbour warehouse went through the house, a 250 square metre windowless wall was formed out to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a flat surface would have a negative impact on the overall appearance of the street, unless special measures were taken to enhance the appearance of the building.
The parties agreed that it would be appropriate to erect a permanent work of art there.
At this time, much was said about Gerði Helgadóttir, the artist,, it says in the summary.
She had worked a lot on mosaic work in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether to hold a competition for the work.
Often it had been discussed that the work needed to reflect life at the harbor, since the harbor had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was built.
When the artist was interviewed, she was so captivated by the idea that she couldn't stop thinking about it.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country again, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerdur received the time she wanted, and when she returned home, she put forward a few proposals for discussion.
It was decided immediately to ask her to work on the project.
At the same time, it was requested that a comprehensive agreement be made with her and the famous art restoration company in Germany, the Oidtmann brothers,, as Gerður had long worked with them in the restoration of famous works of art all over Europe.
Agreement was reached and Gerður worked on the artwork in the workshop of the brothers, who then took care of the installation in the Customs House..
All aspects of the project were handled exceptionally well, by both Gerðar Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, it says in the summary.
It has stood the test of harsh Icelandic weather ever since.
It took Gerði about two years to complete the work, which was completed and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the completion of the Tollhouse,, at the age of 47.
Preparing to move more institutions out of the city.
Iceland's Minister of Social Affairs, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, announced that more public institutions would be relocated to the countryside in the near future.
The minister said this in the Sprengisandur program on Bylgjun in the afternoon.
Recently, it was announced that the Fire Prevention Department of the Housing and Construction Agency would be moved to Sauðárkrók in the autumn.
There are fire safety experts working at the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency north, and the Lands Association of Fire and Rescue Services and Ambulance Drivers has criticized the relocation.
"I think we should take further steps in this matter.
I am preparing for further steps in this situation.
Further transportation," said Ásmundur.
He says he is convinced that a large majority of the population wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
"I think that further political decisions will have to be made about moving public jobs out to the countryside, as he was doing with the Housing and Building Agency, but he also took the example of other institutions that have been moved out to the countryside, such as the relocation of the Food and Agriculture Agency to Selfoss, the relocation of the Land Mapping Agency to Akranes and the relocation of unemployment benefits to Skagaströnd.
All the main news from the second day of the championships.
The 94th Icelandic Championships in track and field ended at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri today.
A number of records were broken on the second day of competition.
It was expected to be an exciting competition in the women's javelin throw at Þórsvöll, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the women's javelin throw record in 2014, which stood until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR broke the record in May last year.
Vigdís won back the national record earlier in the summer and has been in fantastic form in recent weeks, having improved the national record three times so far this summer.
Elísabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and was not at her best today.
She had only one valid throw of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the furthest in the day, 60.08 meters in her final attempt, setting a meet record in the process.
Her 62.69m personal best, set earlier in July, she was far from it.
Guðrún Karitas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day and improved her personal best with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's competition, FH athlete Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the national champion in the javelin throw, won the competition with an easy victory. He threw 73.84 meters in his next to last throw and set a competition record.
HIs national record in the event is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic athlete and Icelandic champion in the discus throw, competed in the shot put on Þórsvelli yesterday, but today he competed in the discus throw, which is his main event.
Guðni Valur's Icelandic record is 65.53 meters, but he threw 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the farthest in the day, he had one valid throw that earned him second place with 49.43 meters..
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic champion in long jump, won the long jump competition with an overwhelming victory. Hafdís jumped the furthest today, 6.25 meters, which is less than 40 centimeters from her national record.
In the women's 200m, it was ÍR athlete Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds, but her national record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was successful in Akureyri, winning two gold medals in the 100 metre sprint and in the 4 x 100 metre relay, and another in the 4 x 400 metre relay today.
In the men's 200m, FH's Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson was first in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelsson of Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100m and 400m.
He does not receive a fine for a 27 million kr. Bitcoin harvest.
The Tax Appeal Board has rejected the claim of the tax prosecutor who demanded that a man be fined for underreporting his income, which was derived from the sale of rafmynt Bitcoin.
The committee comes to the conclusion that the tax prosecutor did not provide convincing arguments as to why it was necessary to fine the man.
In the ruling of the commission, it was stated that the tax inspector believed that the man had fulfilled the material requirements for incorrect tax returns for the years 2016 and 2017.
He had also failed to declare his income from the sale of rafmynt Bitcoin, which amounted to 27 million krones, either deliberately or through gross negligence.
The man was fined for his behaviour.
The man rejected this in a letter to the committee.
He did, however, admit to selling rafmynt for 27 million in 2016.
Hana he would have acquired with a graft in the years 2009 and 2010, when it was both easy and cheap with a normal home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the rafmynt, the tax framework for such a sale was very unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been unreasonable to expect ordinary citizens to be aware of such arrangements in their tax returns.
He had not intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and had declared his ownership of the property on his tax return as a deposit on a foreign currency account.
He had inquired with both experts and the tax inspectorate, but without success.
Then he considered that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived there for a few years when he began to dig for Bitcoin.
As a result, he had been in a worse position than others to understand complicated rules that the tax authorities had not been able to form a clear opinion on.
The man considered it right that his taxes for these two income years would be reassessed and that he would not be punished in any other way.
He then reiterated that he works in Iceland and has paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He had never intended to evade his responsibilities in an inappropriate manner.
The demand for sequestration was out of all proportion and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur attracts attention: "This man knows what football is all about. "
Breiðablik's Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been a bit of a controversial figure, but he has also attracted a lot of admiration for his performances so far this season in the Pepsi Max division.
Blik will be in the limelight tonight when they take on ÍA in a live broadcast on Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur is banned from playing due to four yellow cards during the season and therefore does not play with a new haircut as he has done in the games so far this season.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his forehead before the match against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
I don't know exactly who he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, this guy was really trying in the game.
He did not hide.
He wants the ball every time and if someone was going to equalize this game, I thought he would do it or create it, said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stand when asked about Brynjólf.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people. "
It is sometimes difficult to figure out what position he is in.
He looks a little to the left when the game goes on, but he has a very free role in the team,, said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson says that Brynjólfur is a real comedian and celebrates the fact that he is bringing a colorful man to the team. "There is no disagreement about the fact that he is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with the hair, and always being ready to meet and answer in interviews..
It's incredible how many people are interested in him, which tells me that this man knows what football is all about.
"I am an entertainer.
I am supposed to be here for the people and to have fun with them..
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying to get in and watch what happens next on his head..
This man is a genius," said Máni.
A KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with a number of teams in the second division "
Tobias Thomsen, a player for KR in the Pepsi Max-deild, seems to be on his way out of the club.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Fótbolti.net also reported on the case.
Toby wants to start the season in his home country, but first he has to terminate his contract with KR, where the Danish league starts earlier than the Icelandic one.
The club knows that he misses Denmark and has shown him a lot of understanding,, said Tobias to Bold.
"I have been in contact with a number of teams in the B- division and is likely to move before the end of the Icelandic season..
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay up KR's contract with me.
He then says that he will probably have to accept a salary cut in Denmark.
"Danish companies may have been more affected by the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland. "
Bjartmar, the bicycle repairman, has repaired bicycles for millions - and is now responding to the DV article.
For more than a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He climbs up and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the nickname "bike whisperer" as a result.
In the past, there was a lot of commotion when a man published an account of his interactions with Bjartmar..
DV then referred to discussions on the Facebook group of Vesturbæ residents, where it was stated that Bjartmar had spoken to the man on Austurvelli and said that the bicycle might have been stolen.
It was not possible to read anything else from the original writings of the raft pilot than that Bjartmar had stolen him..
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV report has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the original reports of the incident were not at all reflective of what actually happened yesterday on Austurvelli.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from the victim of a rape victim that these were indeed his rape victim's rape victim's rape victim's rape victim's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim 's rape victim
The information he received from the alleged owner came from others, but the information turned out to be false, said Bjartmar.
I saw the goat and he recognized the skutla, after all, he had information about a rafskutla that had been missing for a long time and was being searched for.
He hesitated at first, but when he saw him getting ready to drive off in the skidder, he decided to talk to the man.
The owner was convinced of his guilt and decided to have a talk with the man.
In general, he goes very well in such cases, but before he managed to finish what he had to say, the man had taken the word from him.
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter offered to show him the ticket for the bicycle and called the police himself.
"Yes, good,," Bjartmar said, "let's get this straight.. "
The owner of the electric scooter then proved ownership of the electric scooter and drove off.
Later, the rightful owner of the electric scooter told his story on Facebook, as previously reported.
In the short time that Bjartmar has been engaged in this activity, he says that he can count the number of times he got into trouble with people on the fingers of one hand.
"I have had peaceful dealings with the toughest men in Reykjavik, " Bjartmar said, and pointed out that bicycle thieves are usually the smallest brothers and sisters of society, drug addicts, mentally ill people and other people who are on the street for one reason or another.
"The addiction is a hard landlord and somehow the next dose has to be paid for, unfortunately theft is an easy way to achieve that goal,, says Bjartmar.
"My relationship with these people is so good that he has brought a lot of that good people with him.
There are cases where people have gone through treatment and taken themselves in hand and come to me to help with what he is doing.
In general, Bjartmar's relations with bicycle riders are cordial.
Some people know him and what he is doing and offer to show him receipts, number plates of bicycles and so on.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has received little attention.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police are even going so far as to tell people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the earlier reporting of DV and says that he is not some sort of self--appointed police officer on a personal quest for justice.
Asked whether he is not now on thin ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police,, Bjartmar replied that this is indeed the case.
Of course the police should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are not doing this.
I have, for example, watched police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen bicycles..
She is absolutely uninvolved in these matters.
When the police are not doing anything about it, and this is right in front of his face, and the experience has shown that he has been able to achieve success in this field, then why not, says Bjartmar.
He says that he has achieved such great success in tracking down stolen bicycles that he sometimes runs into his " clients " on the street.
The times that Bjartmar has called the police for help, they have actually not come.
"This is not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the owners of the bicycles' fault, " said Bjartmar, who is disappointed that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer because the police are not doing their job.
Bjartmar's achievements are not disputed.
There are many stories of people thanking Bjartmari for returning their property to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long since lost count of the number of bicycles that he has returned, and that the amounts involved are probably in the millions, if not in the tens of millions.
Vega there electric bicycles, electric tricycles and heavy electric vehicles, but electric bicycles can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works at a daycare center and every other weekend he works at a shelter.
HIs bicycle search is unpaid work that he does in his spare time.
Lifeyrissjóðs and long shadows
2019 was a big anniversary year in the history of the Icelandic pension funds..
In fact, civil servants had been receiving pensions from the Danish king since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund for civil servants was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all public employees.
The foundation for today's general pension funds for wage earners was laid in 1969 with all--union collective agreements on the labor market, which stipulated atvinnutengda pension funds with compulsory membership and full-fledged collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, legislation was passed on the basis of these agreements, and the welfare system continued to grow after that.
The pension system for workers was not the only radical change that the labour movement of the 20th century forced through through its struggle over wages.
In 1955, the unemployment allowance was granted in a similar way in historic strikes, and the union also gradually achieved its demands for sick leave and a sickness fund, significant holiday rights, improvements in housing, and other things that mattered a lot.
All these rights cost a lot of hard and bitter struggle, but in hindsight proved to be much greater and more lasting benefits than the increase in the amount of money in the wage packet, which vanished as quickly as the bubble of inflation that characterized the period after the war and up until 1990.
The background to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
In the end, men agreed that the funds would be in effect the property of the members, but the labour movement had to accept that the boards of the funds would be made up of representatives of employers and members in equal numbers.
In the following years after the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers in the boards of the funds was often the subject of debate in labour unions, but it never came to fruition, and as a result, we are still stuck with the unnatural situation where the representatives of the fund members are not in the majority in the boards of the funds..
Article 36 of the law no. 129 of 1997 on compulsory pension insurance and the operation of pension funds deals with the pension funds' investment strategy.
In the first sentence of the first paragraph, it says that "the pension fund should have the interests of the pensioners in mind. "
Also stated in the 5th paragraph: "Lifeyrissjóð should set ethical guidelines for investments. "
In the hluthafastefnu of the Lífeyrissjóðs verslunarmanna, there are, among other things, the following provisions, in the wake of the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Lífeyrissjóður is a signatory to the United Nations (UN PRI) guidelines on responsible investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and fagfjárfestors in the United States and Europe.
The regulations deal with how the emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance,, can contribute to better investment results for stock portfolios.
In this way, the interests of investors and the objectives of the society as a whole go hand in hand in a broader context.
LV considers it important for companies, especially those listed on the stock market, to have a public policy on good corporate governance, fair wages, social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Icelandic pension fund Gildi, which is one of the largest pension funds in the country, has set itself a " policy on responsible investments " and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest fashion word in the Icelandic language, " shadow governance ".
Since the word is new in the language, it is not to be expected that it has been defined to the hilt, but it seems that the following definition is " the most taken " : Skuggestjórn is when the leader of a trade union says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the trade union to the board of the pension fund with recommendations or instructions on how they should take a stance in a particular matter.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the first opportunity.
If the leader of the party does not take this up in the media and does not talk about dismissal, it is not " shadow governance " after all, since such communications between people are, after all, commonplace in the world of finance as elsewhere.
I let the reader decide which of the two routes he finds " more sinister. "
In particular, two men have tried to shape this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of 25 July 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at the newspaper Fréttablaðet and Ásgeir Jónsson, the Seðlabankstjóri.
The impetus for both of them came after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (ditching them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík branch of the Federation of Icelandic Trade Unions sent out those instructions to the representatives of the company in the board of the Lifeyrissjóður Verslunarmanna pension fund that they should not support the possible purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they would be dismissed.
Sometime later, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and Ragnar Þór followed suit with his recommendations, which were based on the decision of Bogi Nils.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to discuss the matter in the Friday edition of the newspaper Frettabladet with large words about shadow governance, lawbreaking and the need for changes to the law.
The little thistle certainly had to carry a heavy load, even though the blessed thistle was in the subjunctive mood and was eliminated quickly.
Since the matter is important, we should focus on the substance of the matter at the end.
He went on to discuss the aspects of the law governing pension funds that apply to this case.
This means that the management of the pension funds are obliged to take care of the interests of the pensioners and to have ethical guidelines in their investments, and this is further specified in the regulations of both Gildis and the Lifeyrissjóðs verslunarmanna.
Lífeyrissjóðs do not, however, have to focus solely on short- term profitability in their investments.
Sustaining such a course of action would be, in fact, a very dangerous course of action, and it would not take long to find examples of this in the past,, where large loans from banks and funds were given to reckless adventurers and environmental vandals, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was clearly on thin ice when he decided to cut out an entire group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed on the Icelandic market and weakening its position in the eyes of investors..
Fortunately, he saw the error of his ways and withdrew the proposal..
Time will tell whether the investment of the pension funds in the company can be considered to be in the best interests of the pensioners.

One of the infected did not observe homecoming quarantine.
One of the three who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country on the day before yesterday came to the country from Estonia on the 15th of July, about one and a half weeks ago.
He is an Icelander who is not permanently resident in the country, and therefore did not receive clear instructions to carry out the so-called homecoming quarantine after arriving in the country and take a second sample a few days later.
He was tested at the border and received a negative result.
"He is in the Icelandic community and, in fact, should be placed in that kind of accommodation,," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist in the field of infectious diseases at the Landlæknes Office and the deputy to the chief medical officer while he is on vacation, in a conversation with the newspaper Fréttabladet today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the kennitala and if the kennitala is not registered, he is not automatically invited to the second screening..
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, but because of his ties to the country he should have used the Icelandic form.
However, he did not realize this.
"If the kennitalan is not registered, then it is up to the individual to apply for the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realised that it was the right thing to do,, says Kamilla.
This means that it is clear that they need to strengthen the information about this while they are looking for a way to make a self--propelled registration system even though the Icelanders do not register their identity numbers.
Or alternatively, to make it more obvious who is involved in the Icelandic community in the registration system,," she explains.
Fortunately, the person in question was able to avoid being classified as a participant in the Icelandic community, even though he is an Icelandic citizen.
Only six have been sent into quarantine since he was diagnosed yesterday, and these six were all in contact with him.
They will have to take a sample, but two of them are already showing symptoms of a Covid-19 infection..
The man was tested at the border on 15 July and received a negative result.
Kamilla says that it is likely that he was recently infected with the virus and that it was not yet possible to detect the virus in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not rule out the possibility that the man was infected in Iceland, but did not bring the virus with him to the country.
"It is not possible to say that it is definitely an imported infection, because it has been so long since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here in connection with the sporting events. "
However, she says this is unlikely because of the small number of people he was in contact with here.
"It is, in fact, very unlikely," says Kamilla, but adds that it is not possible to rule it out until Icelandic Genetics has sequenced the virus in the man.
"If we get a new strain of the virus that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he brought it to the country..

Then 75 people were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year old black man who was murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Solskjær: This is not the game that defines the season.
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the match against Leicester in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose to Wolves,, then Solskjær and his men end up in 5th place and miss out on the Champions League.
However, they still have a chance to qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League in the next month.
"We are not at the end of the road.
If we get a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we have not had a bad season, said Solskjær.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of their journey as they still have a long way to go to catch up with the two teams above them. " said Solskjær.
It is clear that the nerves of men will be stretched at 15:00 today, but Solskjær tried to make it look like a normal match..
"If you want to be part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is the basis of the company..
We have created a fantastic opportunity to end the season well and now it's up to us to make the most of it.
"This is not the most important game of the season, it is just the next game..
Every football player knows that the next match is always the most important.
The results do not define the season, they have already had many moments that define this season.
" Bruno Fernandez's arrival changed a lot for us and I believe that as a whole, they are in better shape and more mentally strong than last season, " said Solskjær.
65,000 cases per day
65,490 new cases of the coronavirus were reported in the United States on Tuesday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 cases have been confirmed in the western hemisphere from the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 people died from the virus on the day before, but in the four days prior to that, more than 1,000 people died from the virus each day.
A total of 146,460 deaths caused by the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, the number of deaths caused by the virus is expected to reach 1.750,000 on August 15.
Fearing a second wave of the epidemic.
The Spanish government is now struggling to contain the spread of COVID-19, which is spreading rapidly in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no new cases in 24 hours since the beginning of May and the news comes at the same time as the Spaniards begin to lift one of the strictest exit bans in Europe.
The setback led to the British authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to go into quarantine upon their return home.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia, in the northeast of Spain, where the authorities have imposed wide--ranging restrictions in an attempt to stem the tide.
In the city of Barcelona, nightclubs will be closed for the next two weeks and nightclubs will have to close at midnight.
Now, a ban on leaving the area is in effect for 200,000 inhabitants of Segria province in the western part of Catalonia..
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the influx of foreign tourists and has been badly affected by the flu epidemic.
Tui, the largest travel agency in Britain, cancelled all flights to Spain and the Canary Islands that were scheduled for today.
Many governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but there is little enthusiasm for re-imposing a comprehensive travel ban that has wreaked havoc on the economy.
For example, Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken a very negative stance on such and similar weapons, which he does not want to use.
Then, Jean Castex, Prime Minister of France, said that the " nation would not survive economically or socially " if a nationwide exit ban was reintroduced.
Many politicians hope that the local measures that reach out to the inhabitants of individual towns, cities or areas will be enough to stop the spread of the virus in the next round.
Five new infections in Iceland - three within the country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday, in addition to two more at the border.
Five individuals were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infections in Iceland on Tuesday.
In a statement from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, it is stated that one of the infections is related to the infection detected in the Rey Cup football tournament the previous day.
He has been placed in isolation and the sixteen who were in close contact with him have been placed in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social life of an athletic club in Reykjavík and was, according to the announcement, " only a part of the athletic team " in quarantine.
Others who were sent to quarantine are related to the man in other ways..
The source of this infection is unknown, and the tracing of the infection is in full swing at the tracing team of the Chief of Police.
The organizers of the Rey Cup tournament have followed the guidelines and regulations of the Norwegian Directorate of Health and the Directorate of Civil Protection, which are still in force,, and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures from the match the previous day attracted attention because they showed the players celebrating their team's good performance in very close proximity to each other on the field.
Just before 11 o'clock today, the organizers of the event posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
There stands "ATH: Parents are advised to respect the rule that competitors must collect their own equipment from the school.
Parents are not allowed to do this..
Thanks for the shown understanding..
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection detected the day before.
It says in the announcement: "Icelandic Genetics has sequenced the infections and a new strain of the virus has been identified that has not been found in Iceland before. "
Smit tracing is also underway in the case and the infected person is in isolation and 12 people are in quarantine due to the infection.
The third case is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, on 15 July.
He was located in the southwest of the country.
He is now in isolation and six people who were in close contact with him during quarantine.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two were detected at the border and are awaiting the results of further tests to determine whether they were infected at the border.
In conclusion, the Almannavarnir Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the National Health Directorate urge people to exercise caution and to pay close attention to personal infection prevention.
If there is the slightest suspicion that the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the person is asked to go to the nearest health station to take a sample.
Patreksfjörður says the camping site is overbooked for the holiday weekend - it is sending visitors elsewhere.
The camping site in Patreksfjord is fully booked for the weekend, according to an announcement from Vesturbyggð.
Visitors are encouraged to look at other accommodation options.
It names Vesturbyggð's Bíldudal, Tálknafjörð, Melanes on Rauðasandi, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík as other alternatives.
There is a lot going on in Patreksfjord this weekend,, because as in previous years, the Skjaldborg festival of Icelandic documentary films will be held in the town..
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the city.
From the demand for the camping area, it can be expected that there will be a good turnout this year, as long as the weather does not get in the way, but DV reported earlier in the day that the weather forecast was poor.
However, the worst weather is expected in the south, and Patreksfirðinga should not be disappointed.
The website bb.is reported first,, and said that all other accommodation in the city was already fully booked.
A whole apartment building collapses on the best spot in the city.
Rumanian workers live free of charge at Dunhaga 18–20.
In the meantime, the owners are seeking building permits for renovations, but their applications have been stuck in the system for three years.
In one of Reykjavík's oldest, most forested and most expensive neighborhoods stands a large apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house, there are about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house there are two staircases, each with four fairly spacious apartments..
They are between 93 and 130 square meters, though most are over 100.
The house has a rich history.
It was built in 1959 and has housed, among other things, a video rental shop, Skóstofan, the Mjólkursamsölun mjólkurbúd, the gunsmith shop of Joa, a fish shop and now Háskólaprent.
The house has, to put it mildly, seen better days.
The house is now badly damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
According to the company register, the owners of D18 ehf. are Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdottir.
Magnús was responsible for the ownership group of Borgun and was the managing director of the ownership company Borgun.
In the group of owners of the holding company Borgun, is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún also owns a third of D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, ran the shipping company Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has done little or nothing to maintain it since then.
The neighbors say that the condition of the house has deteriorated continuously since then, though most of the deterioration has occurred in recent years.
On the Facebook page of the residents of the neighborhood, one of the residents said that the house had "not been particularly lively in the last few years. "
There may also be a factor in that the owners have over a number of years sought to change the house and the grounds.
Other neighbors say the house has not been in good condition for a long time.
"It is long overdue for something to be done about this blot and it is sad that it has dragged on for so long.. "
He also says that he is angry at the owners of the house for not driving the project to completion, finding a common ground with their neighbors, and ending the " legal quagmire " .
"It should be done in consultation with the community in the surrounding area so that it can be pushed through and completed..
The "Lögfræðistap" that the inhabitant refers to is the planning process of the area, which has been going on at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build an extension on top of the existing multi--story apartment building and behind it, a new lift house and one--story extension.
The building permit that was issued for this project was appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court, which ruled that the permit was invalid because the project was not in accordance with the local development plan and that the pre--permit notification was insufficient.
Reykjavíkurborg then started deiliskipulags work and completed it with an announcement in Stjórnartíðindir in July the previous year.
The same plan was also challenged and fell out of effect in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years had passed since the original application for building permit, and the owners of the house on the original site.
The house had deteriorated considerably by this time, and the neighbors were getting tired of it.
When DV asked the neighbors about the situation, the neighbors responded in various ways.
Some understood the intentions of the owners of the house, while others did not..
Others directed their anger at the city, while others did not.
Others were angry but not out for revenge.
Others said the parking spaces were a thorny issue, but neighbors have used unused parking spaces at Dunhaga 18–20 to park their cars..
One of the complainants in the case said he was tired of the bureaucracy.
"That we have to go through this process three times is absolutely unbelievable.
It is as if Reykjavíkurborg cannot read.
Today, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the city's slippery bureaucracy and grandiose plans of the owner and many years of work of those who are now at the beginning of the project.
When a reporter arrived at Dunhaga 18, he was greeted by open doors and garbage piles.
A Playstation console and a new television lay among other rubbish on the ground - victims of Icelandic summer cleaning.
The door was opened into the old offices of Háskólaprent and there was a strong smell of cat urine..
It is clear that someone has taken up residence in one of the corners, but no one is visible.
Stacks of couches and beds, and a few sheets of geology,, which may have been intended to become a book,, lay on the floor.
The stairways of the house were open and life was in both of them.
The reporter was so lucky to run into one of them.
There were Romanians cooking potatoes in the evening meal, and they invited a reporter in.
The Romanians work for the staffing agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and according to DV, the company has not paid for the premises except for heating and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not reasonable to collect rent.
From the post boxes in the hallway of the house it is clear that there has been a large number of foreign workers living there in recent years.
The operation of staffing agencies has not been immune to the Covid-19 situation, as the downturn in tourism has led to a downturn in the construction industry, and these two sectors have been the most active in using the services of staffing agencies.
Nevertheless, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do, and they hung their work gloves and mittens in the common room to dry after a long workday in the rain.
It should be noted that, despite the appalling state of the house, the apartment in which the boys were staying appeared to have been well maintained..
When the reporter said goodbye to the Romanian boys, he suddenly became aware of the irony of the situation: in the best part of Reykjavik, there is a 1,500 square metre property that is dilapidated.
The owners want to improve the house and the neighbors want to improve the condition, but they disagree on the definition of "improvement. "
In the middle sits the planning department of the city, the victim of endless appeals and complaint procedures in the planning process, and the slow--moving decisions of the Ombudsman's Committee for Environment and Natural Resources.
In the house live Romanian workers,, perhaps those who will improve the situation when the Icelanders stop bickering.
The article was originally published in the Sunday edition of DV on July 17.
In the wake of the coronavirus epidemic, an anti- obesity campaign.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will give 10 million pounds to a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on advertisements for fast food, following his serious illness, partly due to his weight.
It is planned that Johnson will launch the campaign, which has been given the name Better Health, on Monday, but with the campaign, doctors are to be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their overweight patients, and there will also be a campaign to increase the number of cycle paths.
Then advertisements for fast- food restaurants on television will be banned after 21:00,, according to British media sources.
"COvid-19 has made people aware of the short- and long- term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined to use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier food,, " said a government spokesman.
Johnson himself has struggled with his weight, having been admitted to intensive care after contracting the coronavirus in the spring,, and this is partly due to his weight.
Women are better suited to lead the changes.
She said that the new constitution is the biggest step that the nation can take in the direction of greater distribution of power, transparency and in the fight against corruption and the interests of the whole.
We need to start changing gears a little now, and who is better suited to lead these changes than the group of society that is more comfortable in these gilded surroundings.
There are women," said Helga.
Women in Iceland are famous for their women's solidarity.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
So now it's up to us to lead these changes..
She said she was a little worried about the emphasis on Iceland as "the best in the world" in terms of gender equality and human rights.
Then we are not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
There is a lot of it.
We have to know where they are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listening to the voices of marginalized groups.
We do not all live by the same rules here," said Helga.
When asked, she said that women were, in many ways, in a good position in Iceland, but added that, like in many other places, Icelandic women lived with extremely masculine values.
She said that politics revolved around personal interests, dominance and power, which were the forces that perpetuated injustice in all societies.
" Women have now formed this group and come together to say that they are fed up with the fact that the Alþingi keeps ignoring this national referendum from 2012, " she said.
"It is these feminine qualities that we are thinking about when we look at this from that perspective..
Based on human rights and nature protection, cooperation and the fact that everyone sits at the same table, she said, adding that these were the founding principles of the new constitution.
"Iceland is a very rich country in terms of natural resources and it is ridiculous that people live in poverty here.
It's ridiculous, we can divide in a different way," said Helga.
It's ridiculous that there is some kind of natural law that says that women's jobs are always paid less.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to endlessly fight for wages that are commensurate with human dignity.
It is possible to sign the petition for a new constitution here through electronic Iceland.
Attempted to rob a pedestrian in the city center.
A man was arrested in the city centre in the night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to steal money from them.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbæ, where two people were arrested in connection with the case.
Then the police stopped a motorcyclist in Hlíðen where the motorcyclist was driving at 146 km/ h where the maximum speed is 60 km / h.
In addition, he had previously been stripped of his driving licence.
The police in the Greater Copenhagen area had their hands full in the night and registered more than 80 cases in the police log from five o' clock in the evening to five o' clock in the morning.
There was a particularly high number of noise complaints related to weddings.
In the early hours of Saturday, eleven noisy parties were reported to the police and this was considered to be a lot in the police log.
In the night, however, 22 cases of noise pollution were reported to the police.
The prisoners were placed in a cell in the night.
In Árbæ, the police were called out in the night when people shot fireworks into the air.
They had managed to get away by the time the police arrived.
Nine drivers were stopped for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Four people were arrested for fighting in the city center in the night, and one of them was placed in custody.

In addition, police officers stopped a motorist who was towing a trailer in Kjalarnes yesterday..
The bicycle equipment of the caravan was, according to the police log, in a " very bad condition " and was seized.
It is possible to stay in Monet's house during the holiday.
The house that the impressionist painter Claude Monet lived in for the last forty years of his life is now available to rent on the Airbnb website..
The next vacant nights in the house are over the summer holidays.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy in France.
The famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two sitting rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone wants to rent the house, he must rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb website, it is the next to be available after the weekend of the Labor Day holiday, so it may be suitable for some laborers on holiday to rush to book the painter's house.
The two nights over the verslunarmannahelgi cost only 964 US dollars or just under 130,000 Icelandic krones, according to the newspaper Frettabladet.
There are 100 people in quarantine and some of them have started to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Five people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus within the past three days, and most of the infected are not related.
A number of people have been placed in isolation due to this, and a few of them have started to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people were diagnosed with the coronavirus within the country and two at the land border checkpoint.
A specialist at the Ministry of Health says that the increasing number of domestic transmissions does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in society.
It has been sequenced from the first domestic infection and it is a virus that has not been seen in Norway before, so there is no particular reason to believe that it has been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that is new to the country, but of course we have to be very vigilant now, said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, a specialist in disease control at the Ministry of Health.
The majority of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further tests will be carried out in the coming days, but some of those who were in contact with the infected have started to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now it is not influenza in circulation and there are fewer cases of other respiratory infections, so we can be a bit more liberal with the tests on individuals who would have been tested for influenza during an influenza outbreak,, Kamilla said.
The epidemiological investigation is mostly finished, but it is not excluded that more people will have to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions as to whether it is acceptable to hold such events.
The Director of Communications for the Civil Protection Agency says that as long as people follow the guidelines and regulations, it is well possible.
Kamilla says that it is almost impossible for the infected to have contracted the disease at the sporting events.
"If there are not more people in isolation from these individuals after having been in contact with them at these sporting events, then it can be claimed that the disease prevention measures at the events have worked.
But it is not clear," said Kamilla.
The work of the alarms department is constantly being reviewed.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if the situation warrants it,, " said Kamilla.
After about a week, the capacity limits are to be increased to 1,000 people.
This new position could have an impact on the easing of restrictions.
"A certain form of meditation in cooking" - Sjá the menu of Elísa Viðars.
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an athlete in football and plays for Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a nutritionist.
She needs a lot of energy to get through the day and often has time to cook a good and nutritious meal.
A normal day for me starts with going to work around eight in the morning.
"After work, he goes to the shop to be able to prepare the evening meal before picking up his daughter from the nursery at three o'clock..
Elise finds it very nurturing to pick up her daughter from daycare early.
"It's good to have time with her before training in the afternoon.
After training, it's good to come home and only have to warm up the food.
In the evenings, when the girl is asleep, it feels good to watch one episode to clear the mind..
Elísa does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing her master's thesis in nutrition and knows well what to eat to have enough energy to take care of work, school, family and training.
"What suits me is to eat varied food that is well composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food as good or bad, rather as nutritious or non--nutritious.
It's all right to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time..
Elísa is very interested in cooking.
There is a certain meditative quality to standing in the kitchen and cooking,, which I find very appealing..
I have to say that self--confidence is with me in the kitchen, and I really believe that I's a good cook.
Breakfast: oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, soaked in milk overnight.
The meal is topped off with whatever is available at the time..
Often it is banana and crunchy muesli and coffee.
I'm a big coffee drinker.
Millimál: Extremely variable, but fruit or vegetables, flatbreads, plain skyr with banana and muesli, bread with toppings and I could eat hummus with a spoon from a box if that is the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of salads from what is available in the fridge, quinoa or bygg, falafel balls, kale, baked vegetables with a good dressing..
If the planning goes out of control (which happens often) then the egg yolk in the workplace has come to the rescue many times, and it is two slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, and I'm not asking for more.
Millimál: Fæ something with a lot of carbohydrates before training, bread with filling, cereal or fruit.
Dinner is often a fish dish at my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflicts between police and protesters in Seattle
The municipal authorities of Seattle in the state of Washington have declared a state of emergency in the wake of large--scale protests in downtown.
The police used tear gas and pepper spray yesterday to try to clear a large area that protesters had taken over and stretched over many house blocks in the vicinity of the parliament building.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been detained and that an investigation was underway into the damage done to a police station in the city the previous day, possibly by a bomb.
The city and police authorities say that the protesters threw stones, bottles, grenades and other loose objects at the police and one police officer was taken to the hospital with injuries.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They were called in to show solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there have been repeated clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal law enforcement officers.
There,, as in many other cities in the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, remembering George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25,, protesting systemic racism in the American society and demanding improvements.
Not withdrawn until after the vote.
It is not yet clear whether the dismissals of the Icelandair flight attendants, which are to take effect next month, will be reversed.
The electronic vote on the kjarasamning of the Flight Attendants Association of Iceland on behalf of the flight attendants at Icelandair ends at midday tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the chairwoman of the union, says that she is certain that Icelandair will not make a decision about the layoffs until the results of the vote are in.
"This is definitely connected," says Guðlaug Líney.
There have been no resignations reversed, this has to be settled so that the planes can be manned.
People are also eager to find out whether they will have a job after the end of the month.
Voting is taking place on a contract that was signed the previous week, on the night of 19 July.
It is anticipated that it will remain in force until the end of September 2025 and is based on a previous agreement that flight attendants had previously rejected in a vote.
On 17 July, the board and the trades union council of the Icelandic Airline Pilots Association voted to call for a general strike at Icelandair, the vote was by secret ballot.
This never happened, but it was decided in the wake of Icelandair's decision to terminate negotiations with the Flight Attendants' Union, to dismiss all its flight attendants and seek a collective agreement with another union.
Then, the airline's pilots were to take on the role of security guards on board temporarily.
When asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it is difficult to say.
People are in shock after this attack by Icelandair, when all of the airline's flight attendants were fired and it was announced that the company would negotiate with a different union..
Now it will become clear whether it has an effect," she says.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair at the end of April, when 900 of them, about 95 percent, were laid off.
The notice period for those with the shortest working life is three months, and it ends at the end of the month of July- August.
In this group are about 90% of the flight attendants of Icelandair.
What will happen if the agreement is not accepted.
Then they want to continue negotiations with their counterparts.
With this agreement, they are meeting the demands of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that flight attendants have gone too far. "
Voting on the labor agreement ends and Icelandair will announce the results of the third quarter on the morning of the next day.
Voting on a new collective agreement for flight attendants will end at noon on Tuesday.
Icelandair's second quarter results will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results show that the company's revenue fell by 85 percent compared to the same period last year.
The electronic vote on the Icelandair agreement between the Icelandic Pilots Association and the Association of the Icelandic Economy began on Wednesday, 22 July and will end on Monday, 27 July at 12 noon.
Those who can vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the Flight Attendants Union.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new collective agreement on the night of Sunday, July 19,, after the airline broke off negotiations with the union earlier in the week after flight attendants voted overwhelmingly to reject the previous collective agreement in early July.
Then, on Friday, Icelandair announced that it had fired all of its flight attendants and flight attendants, but they were rescinded after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed.
According to the new collective agreement, flight attendants have to fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The collective agreement is valid until 2025, but it has been integrated with the provisions for pilots and flight attendants about how long they can fly on one shift.
The agreement was presented to FFFI members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and many flight attendants who spoke to the news agency afterwards expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most agreed that it was necessary to accept the agreement in order to keep the FFÍ alive.
Icelandair's second quarter results will be announced tomorrow, but the company's EBIT, its operating profit for the exclusion of fuel costs and taxes, is negative by 100 to 110 million USD or 15 billion Icelandic crowns.
Icelandair sent the Stock Exchange preliminary figures last Wednesday, which said that the company's revenues amounted to around 6 million USD or 830 million Norwegian krones during the quarter.
Handbags and their equivalents amounted to 154 million US dollars at the end of the quarter, around 21 billion krones.
Icelandair is also planning to offer shares in the company for sale in August.
Icelandair is aiming to complete negotiations with fifteen creditors, the government and aircraft manufacturer Boeing before the end of the month before going ahead with a shareholders' meeting.
A new strain rather than a new species of virus
"A new strain means that this person came from abroad.
This is not something that has been cooking in the domestic pot," says Már Kristjánsson, head of the infectious diseases ward at Landspítalan, about the news that a " new type of virus " has been discovered in Iceland.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was infected had taken part in the social activities of a football club at the Rey Cup tournament,, but the source of the infection has not been found and the search for the source of the infection is ongoing.
Also, one person who came to the country on 15 July was infected, and two people who were in contact with him started to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Then a new strain of the virus was detected yesterday, which is related to the strain detected the day before, and after genetic analysis by the Icelandic Genetics Institute, a new strain of the virus was discovered " which has not been detected in Iceland before.
The smit tracking has been completed in connection with that smit.
Már stresses that this is not a new virus, it is the same virus that has spread all over the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to talk about a new strain of the virus rather than a new species of the virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could say anything about the beginning of a second wave, Már says that at the moment it is a single case, and that it could go so that there is nothing more to it.
"However, if there are cases within the country that are not connected to the outside world and are of the same genetic type as this particular strain, it would be possible to draw the conclusion (about the second wave) but it is premature to do so at the moment,, " explains Már.
Happiness in the hot tub
The secret to the happiness of the Icelanders is hidden in the hot tubs.
BAFTA award--winning BBC producers lead viewers to believe in the likelihood of a nation of swimming pool and hot tub addicts in a funny video.
Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world and it is claimed that there are more bathing places per inhabitant in Iceland than anywhere else in the world.
The natural geothermal heat is the basis of it, but also the tradition of swimming.
Children's swimming lessons were mandated by law in 1940, but older citizens are just as eager to use the hot water to improve their health..
Sailing is described as an integral part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and status.
Without mobile phones, people talk to each other on a personal level about home and abroad or enjoy the healing power of the water: meditating and recharging the batteries of their souls and bodies..
It's going to be difficult to get 100 days in the polls.
There are 100 days until the Americans go to the polls and choose their president for the next four years.
Donald Trump is running for re-election, but he is facing an uphill battle.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, has a significant lead over Trump on a national basis, according to polls.
According to a new survey by the Associated Press news agency, a large number of Americans believe that the country is on the wrong path.
Trumps response to the new global epidemic of the new coronavirus is also very unpopular, and more Americans than ever before believe that the president has mishandled the economy.
In fact, only two out of ten Americans believe that the United States is on the right path.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the epidemic and 48 percent say he has handled the economy well.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average of FiveThirtyEight, Biden's support is 49.9 percent nationwide and Trump's is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to divert attention from his poor performance in relation to the epidemic to Biden, pushing the idea of cultural conflicts and promoting policies that are supposed to turn to laws and regulations.
Biden's campaign, on the other hand, puts a lot of emphasis on keeping the focus on Trump and believes that they have a good chance of winning if the election is in fact a referendum on how Trump has performed over the past four years.
The unpopularity of Trump also seems to be affecting members of the Republican Party, and there are fears that the Democrats could even gain a majority in the US Senate, which has been considered very unlikely up until now.
According to Politico, the Republican Party would suffer its worst defeat in decades if the current level of support for the parties and candidates remained the same.
The outskirts proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections, and now it seems that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare the residents of the suburbs to follow him, among other things by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and fuel racial tensions.
Among other things, Trump has overturned a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in suburbs.
He then urged " suburban housewives " in the United States to read an article by the former assistant secretary of state of New York, in which she claimed that Biden would destroy the suburbs of the United States and took Trump's side.
Biden will destroy their neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it better." said the president.
The residents of the suburbs of the United States are a growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes from this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney received more votes from this group than Barack Obama, but lost the election.
Opinion polls have shown that, despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the suburbs in 2016, his support there has dwindled considerably.
However, the margin varies from poll to poll, but Biden has been ahead of Trump by about 15 percentage points in recent polls.

The Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the tunnel.
After the final decision was made to postpone the Olympic Games, a sporting event that has only been interrupted by world wars,, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic flame would be " the light at the end of the tunnel " and referred to the worldwide coronavirus epidemic.
Elite athletes have an extra year to prepare, and the Japanese authorities are footing the bill for the delay.
Everyone holds their heads high, after all, a lot is at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympics this year, the joy of the Japanese athletes was unmistakable.
They cried and laughed alternately, after all, Tokyo had applied to host the Games in 2016, but lost out to Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were bathing in the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed by a year and will begin on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If it is not possible to hold the games, if the coronavirus is still too much of a threat, the games will be cancelled.
No one wants to think that thought to its conclusion..
The Olympic Games are no ordinary sporting event.
Nothing is spared, the show must always be spectacular, and the aim is to top the last one.
The selection of the host city for the Olympic Games is based on the assessment of the bidding cities by the selection committee.
The more spectacular the presentation — the greater the likelihood of success.
Tōkyo spent 150 million dollars in an attempt to hold the 2016 Olympics, equivalent to roughly 20 billion krones.
In the second time, when they applied for the Olympics in 2020, 75 million dollars, about 10 billion krones were invested in the campaign.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the Games in 2020, the Japanese government had already invested 30 billion kroner in the project.
This amount is, however, only a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and to generally strengthen the infrastructure of the country to be able to host such events, prepare for them and hold the actual games.
Organizers in Japan have said that the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which had been scheduled to take place this year but has been postponed by one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
However, in a report from the state auditor in Japan that came out at the end of last year, it was stated that the actual cost was twice as high.
It is unlikely that it will be possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars on top of the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could be in the range of 1.5 to 3 billion dollars.
The numbers are so high that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state would only cover about half of an Olympic Games with the lowest possible cost..
The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of analysis by economists, who have tried to assess the benefits and benefits of the Games.
In short, it seems that many have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games is not positive for the economy of the cities that host them.
There are some short--term effects,, for example, the number of jobs increases dramatically in the short term, but in the long term, cities are often left with a debt and high operating costs for unused infrastructure.
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is sitting on huge debts from the 2016 Olympics and has struggled to maintain all of the large sports facilities built for the games.
The figures after the London 2012 Olympics have shown that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
It means that there were no new jobs created, except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not fared well financially from hosting the Olympics due to the heavy cost of the infrastructure built for the games.
However, there is often considered to be an advantage in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, which is, however, a great uncertainty regarding the games in 2021.
It is also unclear whether it will be possible to accommodate all of the large number of spectators who normally attend the games.
However, the most important thing is the honor that comes with being chosen, which is difficult to put a price on..
Despite the enormous cost, it is also possible to say that the joy that the games bring is not of the kind that can be priced.
Tho the show is often spectacular and no expense is spared, it's not just about money.
It is the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some athletes, the postponement of the games is welcome..
The Australian pentathlon athlete and gold medalist in her event at the Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, pregnant and would not have been in good form during the summer, but is hoping to be in good shape for the Olympic Games in 2021.
She is one of the athletes who is quite happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after the Games this year, they would have been held back at the right time, which in some cases means that they will retire before the Games even begin.
They simply do not trust their bodies to go through another year of strenuous training..
Few athletes made themselves as much at home in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio as the gymnast Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has appeared in several interviews in her home country of the United States to discuss the Olympics.
She is aiming for the Olympics in 2021, but she is not at all sure that she will still be at the top of the podium in 2021, since she will then be 24 years old.
Although it is not considered to be a high age, it is in a higher league for an elite gymnast.
"It's a sensitive subject, " says Biles, but smiles as she talks about it in an Instagram interview with the Olympic Committee. Asked if she intends to achieve the same level of success at the 2021 Games as she did at the 2016 Games in Rio,.
"I honestly don't know whether she will still be on top after a year of intensive training,," says Biles.
She has previously talked about the fact that her body is no longer able to cope with the strain of gymnastics training.
However, she is still training hard for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to suddenly have to stop practicing when the pandemic was at its peak and the gymnastics facility was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others during the seven--week closure of all athletic facilities.
All of her Olympic gold medals couldn't buy her any extra access, and she had to find other ways to stay in shape like everyone else.
The basic form is certainly better than that of most people.
"We have a tough schedule now.
It was difficult to start training again after the gymnastics hall opened.
They started slowly but are now in full swing again and I will increase the number of training sessions as the year progresses.
Of course we do not know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but they are practiced as if they will be held, they cannot be otherwise..
I've put too much pressure on herself to leave the sport now," Biles said.
With her, as with others, there is a suspicion that the situation could arise that the games will not be held in 2021 at all, rather than in 2021.
It is impossible to predict what will happen.
No one knows how the situation with the worldwide epidemic of the coronavirus will be in July 2021, and the only thing to do is to prepare for the Olympic Games, based on the assumption that they will be held in 2021.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel..
Postponed the wedding due to the plague.
The Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now,," the actress said to People.
"We would like to get married at some point and have the dream wedding and invite all the people who are dear to them.
We decided to postpone it and focus on what is most important right now, and that is to help disseminate information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I'm more interested in world affairs than wedding arrangements these days..
There is a lot going on and we should focus their attention on what is happening in the world..
