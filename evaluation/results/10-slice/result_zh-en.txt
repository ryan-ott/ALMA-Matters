At the Zhejiang University Academic Year Conference, students sang the main role in presenting research results that made people's brains open wide - Xinhua News Agency.
Using air to wash one's hands, using one's own breath to diagnose a disease, making a precise search for the source of the fog and smog, last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year Conference of the Zhejiang University, a series of scientific achievements were awarded.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, the research areas cover the fields of environment, mechanical engineering, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities education, and so on. The students started with a simple curiosity and created many high--end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards in China and abroad.
Biological sensors : his home doctor.
A team of biomedical engineering doctoral students led by Zhang Tingming demonstrated a smartphone- sized biological sensing device on the spot.
"All he needs to do is blow a little bit of air into the device, and it can detect the composition of the air he exhales and make a preliminary assessment of his health condition.. "
Zhang Tingming said that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and when it detects gas, a health report will appear on the smartphone.
On the market, there is a smart ring that is able to detect the wearer's health status. it is usually able to detect temperature, pulse, and other physical parameters..
This set of biological sensors uses a new type of material, graphene, and its target substance is chemical elements. its keen sense of smell allows it to more deeply and accurately detect the state of a person's health.
Smart surgical light : the doctor's high energy eyes.
Besides the smartphone, the surgical room also used the smart surgical light..
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Inventions Exhibition.
The graduate student of the Department of Optoelectronic Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Zhu Yuqin and Shen Junfei team opened a new path in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented the smart LED surgical no-- shadow lamp.
"There are many diseases that are detected very early, that are cut out, that are not in the right place, that are related to the light used in the doctor's surgery. "
According to Shen Junfeng,, for example, when cancer is detected at an early stage, if the doctor is not able to see all of the cancerous tissue, then the cancerous cells will continue to spread..
This type of smart surgical light has four light discs, which can adjust the light spectrum to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light illumination.
During surgery, the surgeon can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness of the light, the light spectrum, the uniformity of the color, and the lack of shadows according to the needs of the surgery and his own habits.
This type of smart surgical light has already been used in the affiliated hospitals of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine's affiliated Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine's affiliated Huashan Hospital, among other hospitals, and received positive feedback.
Last year in October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Using air to wash hands: saving water and cool at the same time.
ordinary people wash their hands by simply splashing water on them, at most applying some soap, squeezing some hand sanitizer, and putting on a hand- sanitizing device invented by Liu Bicheng and others.
Just by standing on the wash basin of the equipment, their body weight would compress the air and force it out.
"it's like a blow- up balloon.
The compressed air, at the water faucet, forms a flowing mixture of air and water.
This way, we can wash their hands clean. "
This method of hand washing has been proven to have the same effectiveness as conventional hand washing, by means of this method of hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on its own gravitational force as a driving force, while also ensuring cleanliness, it can save up to 90 percent of water, and the entire process is completely energy- efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second global summit on major challenges, this invention stood out among the world's top universities and won the only gold award..
He should send it back to me as soon as possible, thanks.
Cancel the order and return the money, without points, from now on. #PRS Org # will not be used again.
Bones and spicy pickled cabbage are not suitable for small friends to eat.
If so, it should be ordered as soon as possible.
There are none at the moment, thank God.
He called me to tell me where he was located #PRS Org #
I didn't want to wait, cancelled the order.

or cancel the order.
It's good, I'm sorry to bother him.
A very meaningful certificate - the emergency first aid certificate.
This is the only one of his certificates, apart from his driving license, that he considers important.
To make it more accessible : the emergency measures are actually the measures to be taken in the event of an emergency, i.e. before the arrival of the ambulance.
Everyone knows that in the process of the ambulance arriving at the scene of the accident, there is still a period of time,, and it is this period of time that is the most crucial..
This is the time when urgent help is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a stroke, a cerebral haemorrhage and stopped breathing, his life's window was only four minutes and four seconds, the golden four minutes and four seconds.
So it is very important for the people around me to know how to give first aid..
When someone collapses in front of them, they can use their professional knowledge to try to revive him, rather than standing there in a state of helplessness, unable to do anything,, this feeling of helplessness is too scary.
"In China, official data shows that every year there are three million people who die unexpectedly, the most dangerous of which is heart failure..
In the United States, the national average is 15% that can be rescued.
In the Las Vegas gambling hotel, 78 percent of those rescued could be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing were below one percent. "
This was the first reaction of the founder of the first reaction, Liu Lei.
If a person's heart stops beating, their breathing stops, their heart stops beating, then chest compressions are of no use.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compressions in order to bring the person back to life..
I find that nowadays, very few people have this kind of awareness to learn emergency first aid, but when a situation arises, they are unable to react in time. Therefore, it is still necessary to call on everyone to learn a little bit of this skill so that they are able to react immediately in the event of an emergency..
It is still possible to save one person's life.
First aid certificates can be obtained at their local Red Cross first aid training centers by registering at the Red Cross first aid training center in Pusan. Students are also eligible for discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of himself 25 years ago, when he wanted to complete his goal of getting a first aid certificate. Putting the emergency response certificate into the list of goals also happened a few months ago, but he actually managed to complete it.
After that, he wants to go for other certificates he wants to get, he plans to go for a diving certificate, he saw a diving certificate in a small red book before, and apparently, he needs to have a diving certificate before he can go for a diving emergency certificate. Therefore, the diving emergency certificate is still very useful.
He ordered # # Number #.
The 13 rupee prawn dumpling is one of them.
I've never tried it.
# Name # does not write clearly.
one costs 13 euros.
Yesterday, the PRS Organization sent the wrong meal, this time only one shrimp dumpling was given to me to eat..
Because the previous time when he entered the code, he saw that it was effective.
To start with the conclusion, in my opinion, the movie " Four Seas " is a bad movie from all aspects.
However, the film itself is not a shining point either, and the choice of music is not as good as it could have been.
There are many types of bad films, falling asleep in a movie theater is one of them, watching a film to the end and being angered by it is also one of them. " Four Seas " is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, it can use many different ways to ignite their anger.
When it comes to insulting the audience, no one is as talented as Tran Hong Nguyen.
The most painful thing about this film is that it is as if it is a creature from a Cormac McCarthy novel, difficult to name, with many holes in it, like the skin of a small man, like the skin of a small man.
Even after watching it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor from the director, but when you think about it carefully, it turns out that it is just a load of bullshit..
First of all, it is very difficult to understand some of the plot twists.
The male protagonist lives in a small island in the south, with his grandmother.
Her grandmother has a wish to see snow, and then the storyline arranges for a neighbor to drive her to the northeastern part of the country to see the snow.
An elderly person sits in a bread truck from the south to the northeast to see snow.
He and his father are still very relaxed about this.
Then this old man just disappeared..
opening a bar on a derelict ship with a female main character and her brother getting a liquor license.
The mountain road has become a closed road thanks to the efforts of a small gang of hoodlums on the island..
The cement truck then stopped in the middle of the road and the cement truck driver couldn't find any of the cement truck drivers around.
The sense of theatricality is too obvious now.
A small- fry criminal with a bad record and suspicions of criminal activity who becomes a deputy police officer for some reason.
In the face of high--interest loans, why they did not report to the police, in the film, the police officer specifically asked whether there was a difficult situation.
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to use a room card to open the door of a hostel, and then forcefully arranges to find the hostel owner, sleeping outside the room door for a night..
This kind of nonsensical storyline pervades the entire film, because the storyline is so nonsensical that, when he remembers it, he feels pained by it.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about this film is its main theme,, or rather, the fact that this film has no main theme at all, and is just a collection of unpleasant characters..
At the beginning of the film, it seems that he wants to make a comedy film, 20 minutes later, it seems that it may be a motivational film. After watching 1/2 of the film, it seems that it may be a drama depicting the life of a small- town youth. After watching the film, one does not know what one has actually seen. This is followed by doubts about oneself, doubts as to why one went to the cinema to watch the film in the first place.
For the most part, people are already very familiar with the formula of most films, for example, if a film is about a motorcycle racer, it will be a coming- of age film with a touch of comedy. The audience is then told how a talented but inexperienced novice makes his way to success.
If he wants to make a romantic film, he should make a film about a young man from a small town who falls in love with a waitress girl..
If he wants to depict the real world, then at the very least, his storyline should not contain things that are out of sync with the normal world.
(e.g. the character played by Ajit Vadakayil, the new motorcycle, which was burnt, but still able to sing,) cannot go to open up some of the holes in the brain that Kennedy saw.
As for the female protagonist, although she is not a weak- minded person, she sometimes behaves like a 5- year old child, and I don't know whether it is due to her acting skills or the director's request.
There is also one point that I do not quite understand, that is, why, as a race car driver,, he is so enthusiastic about adding crash scenes to his own film..
The film's release during the Spring Festival holidays is a clear indication that the filmmakers wanted to give audiences a hard time.

The masonry block machine is widely used in the construction of underground structures for coal, heat, water, electricity and gas, and is a new type of masonry construction material.
e.g. drainage and water storage facilities' various types of inspection wells, rainwater outlets, ditches, septic tanks and small--scale constructions such as bridge wing walls.
The advantage of using prefabricated concrete blocks to build a drainage inspection well is that the four sides of the blocks have a concave- convex groove structure, which, when combined, form a chain lock.
The masonry walls of the shaft are much more resistant to shear forces than the walls of the shaft.
The module is made of a hollow structure, when assembled, the longitudinal holes are connected and the transverse holes are connected. After the core is filled with concrete, a net--shaped reinforced concrete structure is formed, which provides a second strengthening and waterproofing effect.
Both the longitudinal and transverse ribs have a groove for reinforcing bars, which increase the structural strength of the entire structure.

The concrete inspection shaft module molding machine uses imported computer and electrical equipment, seals, hydraulic components, and other components to ensure that the overall performance of the machine is stable and reliable..
The body of the vibrating plate is made of a whole plate of steel, the surface of the platform is cut with a laser, and there are no welding points. This allows the gravel box to move freely in a straight line, reducing mechanical wear and tear.
This reduces the weight of the mold, the filler, and the combination of the two to reduce the amplitude of the vibrations and to ensure that the vibrations are synchronized, to ensure that the vibrations achieve the desired effect.
The wall of the mine is made of a wall body module machine, a vibrating machine, a computer- controlled vibrating machine that adjusts the vibrating amplitude according to the nature of the raw material, a non- wear and tear brake, and thus prolongs the lifespan and lowers the cost.

The Chongqing vocational school pilot modern apprenticeship system, the entrance is already an employee of the enterprise - Xinhua News Agency.
Yesterday, a reporter from the city education bureau learned that from this year onwards, 60 secondary vocational schools in the city will try out the " modern apprenticeship " model of talent training, which will allow students to have the status of apprentice at the same time as they are enrolled in the school. After they graduate, they will be recruited by the companies that have pre--registered them as employees.
The Beijing Education Commission demanded that the standardize the recruitment and acceptance of students at vocational schools and the hiring of workers at enterprises. It stipulated that students at vocational schools and workers at enterprises would have a dual identity as students at a vocational school and workers at an enterprise. It stipulated that students at a vocational school and workers at an enterprise would sign a three--way agreement, and that those who were 16 years old or older but not yet 18 years old would have to sign a four- way agreement with the student, the guardian, the vocational school and the enterprise. It stipulated that the vocational school, the guardian, the student and the enterprise would have to sign a three- way agreement to determine the rights and responsibilities of each party, as well as the details of the vocational school student's on- the job training.
To encourage the trial schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and to cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre--employment training and post--employment training.
The pilot schools must reform the way they train their students.
the college and the company jointly designed the curriculum for the cultivation of human resources, jointly formulated the standards for the curriculum, the course, the job position, the master craftsman, the quality control, and the corresponding implementation plan.
The trial period is based on the bachelor's degree curriculum, and the time of the student's internship in a company is determined according to the specialist training plan. The top- job internship usually lasts for six months..
In the practice of the enterprise, the enterprise should implement the management model of the bangong group. According to the characteristics of the different professions, one master could lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that the apprentices would be able to master the skills required for each of the rotational positions.
According to the plan, from 2016 to 2019 August, the city established three batches of 60 modern vocational high school apprentice training points, each with 50 students or more, and a total of 3,000 students ( apprentices ) were trained.
In accordance with the principle of starting with a pilot project and then rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the

A South African doctor says the Omicron variant is highly contagious but tends to cause mild illness.
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to a report by the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus in South Africa, the spread of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus in South Africa's Limpopo province, a group of 5,000 doctors in the province reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, symptoms similar to those of the flu.
The group's chief medical officer, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he saw dozens of patients every day, but none required hospitalization.
Pile said ： " They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation 。 "
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more susceptible to severe illness from a coronavirus infection.
He said, in contrast, in the previous wave of the Delata infection, the new coronary patients he treated " had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people are admitted to the hospital within a few days.
In the first two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect sufficient data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) summary, only 30% of the hospitalized new coronavirus patients were severely ill, which is half of the proportion of severe illness in the first wave of the epidemic. The average length of hospital stay was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days. In the recent new coronavirus patients, only 3% died, while in the first wave of the epidemic in South Africa, 20 % of the patients died.
The head of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports to say: " At this stage, all indications are that this is a relatively mild disease. "

Election time assessment: what it takes to rescue kidnapped children.
If the class- comparison "there is no buying and selling, there is no killing" of the famous public welfare advertisement slogan, then, in the absence of " trafficking " demand, in a favorable environment, group prevention and group punishment, and all-- citizen anti- trafficking, this type of crime would not be profitable, risky, and costly, so it would not occur frequently.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an urgent information dissemination platform for missing children.
This is for establishing a credible channel for releasing information on missing children and for quickly locating children who have been kidnapped.
Hearing the name of this app as " circle of friends " makes one feel warm.
The new technological means are not only called " artistic " , but are also informationized in a way that is appropriate, practical and effective.
Catching kidnappers, the first priority is to recover kidnapped children, to protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, to social prevention and law education, can be listed with many " big words " 。
However, before the child trafficking case is solved, the safety of the victim's person should be prioritized.
In the face of the urgency of the "search for rescue" mission, issues like "whether kidnapped children should be subject to the death penalty" and other controversial topics can be put on the back burner for the time being. However, rescuing kidnapped children is not allowed.
According to the experience of investigating this type of case, human traffickers are accustomed to quickly leaving the scene after committing the crime.
Every minute that the rescue operation is delayed, the distance between the child and his or her parents increases and the case becomes more difficult to solve..
In this case, the use of the "Bumiputera Bersatu" platform, which is direct and effective in solving cases and finding missing children, is a genuine effort.
In the end, "reclaiming" is a task that requires the entire law enforcement system to work well.
Crushing crime, protecting the rights of children and their parents, from legislation to judiciary and enforcement, all need to be carried out in accordance with the principle of "protecting the weak and helpless".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking from the family to the society can still be improved.
For example, a common case is a family of three at a train station taking a break, the parents sleeping and waking up only to find that the child is missing..
One cannot expect a two- year old child to have enough self- protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, one should at least have the same level of protection awareness.
The parents take turns to rest, or they may place the child in a safe place to prevent the child from being kidnapped. These are the most basic measures to prevent children from being kidnapped..
From the other side of the law enforcement crackdown on child trafficking, the other side of the purchase of kidnapped children also needs to be addressed and punished.
One single act of wrongdoing is often only one link in a long chain of wrongdoing..
According to China's Criminal Law, the minimum punishment for kidnapping and selling children is 5 years, and the maximum punishment is the death penalty, with confiscation of property.
The crime of child trafficking is obviously a crime with a heavier punishment in the trend of "lightening the punishment of crimes".
To this day, there are still many cases of child trafficking..
It can be seen that some people's views on raising children are outdated and their legal awareness is thin..
The law- and order education of this part of the population should keep pace.
In order to effectively control the crime of child trafficking, it is not enough to rely solely on the strict enforcement of official regulations.
If the " market " for kidnapping is widespread, kidnappers are driven by greed to constantly invent new methods of kidnapping. This leads to a situation where law enforcement officers and kidnappers are engaged in a " battle of law enforcement " and the kidnapping operation is doomed to be ineffective.
As a result, the elimination of outdated notions, the dissemination of legal common sense also contribute to the eradication of child trafficking and child prostitution.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two types: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil. There are five grades.
The first pressing of olive oil or called as virgin olive oil, is directly extracted from fresh ripe olive fruits by mechanical cold pressing, after which it is filtered to remove impurities.
According to the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra virgin olive oil is the highest grade of olive oil. It is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, it has a mild herbal aroma, the acidity is less than 1%..
high- quality first press olive oil ( Fine Virgin ) : the acidity is slightly higher, but does not exceed 2%,, the taste is pure and fragrant.
ordinary first press olive oil ( Virgin Olive Oil ) : the taste and flavor are still good, the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3% after the refining process.
refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Pure olive oil (Olive Oil) - a mixture of refined olive oil and olive oil with a certain proportion, to blend the taste and color, its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is a translucent pale yellow.
refined olive- pomace oil ( Refined Olive-Pomace Oil ) is obtained by extracting and purifying the oil from the oil mash.
One who has already seen the level of acidity classification of olive oil should have already discovered that the acidity of olive oil is one of the most important indicators.
After all, the production of olive oil from olives is similar to the production of wine from grapes, which comes from different regions and different varieties of olives. As a result, olive oil of different standards will be produced.
The best habitat for the olive tree is:
The coastal areas of the Mediterranean have the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, including the most suitable soil and climatic conditions
except for the coast of the Mediterranean, other areas can only be planted sporadically in suitable habitats.
The main wine--growing region is the area around the Mediterranean Sea.
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan and Lebanon, as well as countries with similar climates in the Southern Hemisphere, such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc.
The month of harvesting oil from the olive tree.
From 3 to 6 June each year, the olive tree blossoms, and from 7 to 10 October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, changing from green to red, purple and finally black.
From November to the following February is the harvesting season for fruit ( the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
The nutritional value of olive oil :
Olive oil is rich in fatty acids such as monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all oils found so far.
The democratic summit ended, Biden said that the flame of freedom would never be extinguished.
The Summit for Democracy, which was called by US President Barack Obama and attended by leaders from 110 countries, as well as representatives of the government, civil society and private sector, ended on Friday (Dec. 10).
Biden said in his closing speech that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and cannot be extinguished by an authoritarian regime.
He also said that the plan is to hold the second global " democratic summit " next year.
The Taiwanese government representative and political secretary Tang Fang and the currently in exile in the United Kingdom Hong Kong democratic rights activist and human rights activist Lo Cung also spoke at the second day of the summit.
Biden said: "We know that the work that lies before them is daunting.
But they also know that they can face challenges, because they have previously said that the world of democracy is everywhere, just as this summit has shown.
The autocratic political regime can never extinguish the small flame of freedom, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world..
Mr. Biden also said that the defense of democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said: "As the government's leader, we have a responsibility to listen to their citizens, strengthen the democratic shield, push for reform, achieve transparency in governance, and more effectively resist the pressure and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who seek power in the name of public interest before their naked pursuit of power. "
The second day's theme was defending human rights, consolidating democracy, and countering digital authoritarianism, as well as reaffirming the value of democracy.
This day coincided with " International Human Rights Day " 。
The Secretary General of the United Nations, Guterres, also said in his opening speech on the same day that the democratic cause faces challenges all over the world, especially in the face of the new challenges posed by the emergence of new digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm common values and standpoints and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving the problem of inequality, cracking down on corruption, updating the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also needs to condemn all forms of populist, chauvinist and extremist nationalism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.  "
The Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, Rohan Chandran, spoke through a pre--recorded video at the summit and reminded the participants to continue to pay attention to the situation in Hong Kong and the Uighur and Tibetan ethnic minorities and other ethnic minorities in China.
He said ： " For a long time, the world has been affected by China's rise, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use all the resources they have at their disposal ( resources ) to ensure that the resurgence of democracy is their first priority. "
Roh also called on the free world to unite against the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party..
He said: " perhaps some of them are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of them do not want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps they are not aware of ( the Chinese Communist Party's ) threat to their democratic values.
And this was the reason for their failure.
This is also the reason why they must change.  "
Tao Fang, a member of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of
He also shared his experience of how information transparency and building mutual trust can be used to counter the new coronavirus epidemic..
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is on the rise, we have always stood firmly on the front line of the world's struggle against authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
Different regions' authoritarian governments, during the period of the epidemic, used the pretext of public health and collective interests to legitimize the infringement of human rights, and the global democratic movement showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, it is not necessary to block the city to control the epidemic and it is not necessary to shut down the airwaves to defeat false information..
The United States Department of the Treasury announced on the second day of the " People's Democracy Summit " that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries that were deemed to have violated human rights, and that it would also impose sanctions on a Chinese company that was deemed to have used surveillance technology to assist in the violation of human rights.

That's all, I'm calling it quits.

Hello, the restaurant sent a live chicken with water in its mouth. it was alive.
He wanted to try tennis, but he was afraid that he would not be able to keep it up, so he wanted to first find a similar price to practice his hand.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to the level of friendliness, if it is not possible to differentiate, then the expensive is the normal situation and the cheap is the unfriendly one, this type of " entry- level junk " is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, the ball hits the racket's head and the vibrations are very strong, the hard ball cannot withstand it and top players find it difficult to control.
Their logic and subtext is that tennis is so difficult, that they don't know how to play, and that they don't want to spend a lot of money on it, and that they play two times and then they don't want to play anymore. This way it is cheaper to play, and they don't want to spend a lot of money on it.
when he can tell the difference between good and bad, that means he has progressed, then he can come back to this place to buy the expensive ones and earn two times the money..
It is suggested to buy a second--hand good quality tennis racket for the same amount of money, to buy a Prince or Donnay racket, these two brands are not well known, so a good quality tennis racket can be bought for 500 or 600 yuan. A new racket costs 500 or 600 yuan, a second- hand racket costs 200 yuan, the enjoyment of a 1000 yuan racket is the same as that of a 200 yuan racket.
The game is friendly to new players, but after the new player phase, it becomes useless, but the majority of people, especially female players, cannot pass the new player phase.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed several times.
Asked if they could follow up on this a bit more,.
postponed
Thank you

It is possible, but the rider's handler has a lot of problems and is a nuisance to deal with.

In fact, there are a lot of things to be taken into consideration when it comes to dressing up for a woman with a small figure.
The skirts of fat girls cannot be too short or too long. they should be long enough to cover the thighs, just enough to cover the fleshy part of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the thighs will be exposed.
If they are too long, they give the impression of being short and fat.

The Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League is helping to keep the Olympic flame burning - Xinhua News Agency.
On 11 December 2011, Beijing Dream Team player Peng Tianyang (center) scored a goal in a match.
On the same day, the 2021-2022 season of the Beijing Youth Ice Hockey Club League continued at various ice rinks in Beijing.

The Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League, which has been in existence for more than a decade, has become a platform for young ice hockey enthusiasts in Beijing to improve their skills and make friends. It has also provided players for the Beijing youth ice hockey team and the youth team.
The league is playing a role as a sporting event in promoting ice hockey among young people in Beijing, fueling the Olympic ice hockey fever, and laying the foundation for the development of ice hockey in Beijing after the Olympic Games.
The girl was shot as a target for her sister's fundraising: " I thought it was just a flesh wound, so it was okay " - Xinhua News Agency.
At the Hangzhou Martial Arts Square, a young girl stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan per shot" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a girl from Hangzhou who was willing to be a " target " for her sister's fundraising went viral on social media.
The photographs show a young girl standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan per shot" written on it.
This behavior sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Yesterday evening, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou's downtown district confirmed to a reporter from the Beijing News that the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou's downtown district confirmed that the girl was indeed the beneficiary of the fundraising campaign, but that this kind of behavior was not worthy of praise. After being admonished, the girl left the local police station the next day.
The girl's street- side " target " fundraising was discouraged.
The picture shows a girl with long hair standing in front of a large wooden board with black ink writing "human flesh target, 10 yuan per shot" on it. There is another wooden board in front of her with her bank account number and micro-blogging, WeChat and Alipay account numbers written on it.
The picture went viral after it was posted on the internet.
There are some netizens who believe that this was an act of begging for attention. There are also many netizens who sympathize with him.
" Around 10 o'clock in the morning of the 23rd, they were patrolling around the square when they noticed the situation. at that time, the crowd of onlookers had already become quite large. "
The incident took place near the Tianshui police station, where local media interviewed a police officer who said that the two girls were aged between 20 and 25 years old and were dressed in a youthful manner.
One of the girls was crying and begging passers-by to play a game with her, while another was on the sidelines asking for help to raise money for her friend's sister who was suffering from white blood disease and needed surgery.
"They contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's bone marrow treatment. "
The spokesperson for the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou's downtown district told the reporter of the New Beijing Daily newspaper yesterday that the name of the girl was Ji Guilin. She was the sister of Ji Guilin.
However, due to the treatment still costing 30 million yuan, at the time, he could not think of a good way to raise funds,, so he resorted to this kind of behavior.
He said that during the entire process, two young girls were used as targets, one as the target and the other as the shooter, but neither of them were involved. During the entire process, no one shot an arrow, but there were people watching and taking photos, which were later posted on the microblogging site Weibo.
After the police examined the bows and arrows used, it was determined that they did not fall under the ammunition control category.
The responsible person said, " I don't advocate taking this kind of fundraising approach. "
After being warned by a police officer at the police station, she has left the police station.

What was most popular in 2021.
The 2020 Summer Olympics were held in Tokyo, Japan.
He thought that only Olympic athletes could win awards.
A few months ago, a piece of writing titled "a project manager can win a gold medal at the Olympic Games" was very popular. It mentioned that project managers in many projects are in a position to be the first to win a gold medal, and there is no one who can compete with them. Project managers' daily routine consists of hauling bricks, going on business trips and staying up all night. Saving the day and apologizing are also part of their daily routine.
It seems like a joke, but the essence of the article is that project managers have to deal with a lot of hardships in their daily work. what is behind it is a lack of enthusiasm for the current project management work.
And those involved in project management work are also gradually choosing to use some actions to get themselves out of the dilemma of their work..
As the number of PMP (internationally recognised qualification for project management professionals) applicants increases each year, more and more project management professionals are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the China project management 20-year development report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of people who applied for the PMP® certification was nearly 6 million, the number of people who passed the PMP® certification was about 4.2 million, the number of people who held the PMP® certification was about 3 million, accounting for 31.2% of the world's total PMP® certification holders.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified people has increased year after year. This shows that more and more project managers are realizing that relying on the old ways of doing things is no longer possible, as the work environment is constantly changing. Standing on the shoulders of scientific giants, project managers must learn to explore the path ahead.
However, obtaining the PMP certification does not guarantee that project management work will run smoothly.
Many project management novices said that after studying the PMP or IPMP course, they could systematically master the ten major areas and five major process groups of project management, but when they actually started working in project management, they were still in the dark.
Many project managers often complain about the following issues: 1. a lack of project management awareness, which is based solely on personal experience, 2. a lack of a system of project management theory, 3. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 4. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 5. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 6. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 7. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 8. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 9. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 10. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 11. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 12. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 13. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 14. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 15. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 16. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 17. a lack of a system of project management procedures, 18. a lack of

Jie Xin " Double 12 " eve urged consumers to be rational in their consumption - the Economic Observer - a professional financial news website.
This year's " Double 11 " shopping frenzy, the total amount of transactions in the nation's online payment industry reached 17.7 billion yuan, a new record.
The flower-like variety of red packets, the eye--catching livestreamed shopping, and the recurrence of this phenomenon once again make consumers feel benefited. This wave of consumer enthusiasm, on the one hand, makes people marvel at the strength of national consumerism, and on the other, makes them reflect on the influence of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group.
On the eve of " double 12 " , Jie Xin Consumer Financial Co., Ltd. ( hereinafter referred to as " Jie Xin " ) issued a call for rational consumption, urging young people in particular to cultivate a good sense of consumption and consumption habits, to avoid blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the People's Bank of China's 2019 Consumer Financial literacy survey analysis report, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
In general, the Chinese people's performance in financial consumption is good, but there is a large disparity in terms of different aspects of financial behavior and skills. there is still a need to improve the basic level of financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and the young is relatively low, " one old, one young " will continue to be a focus of continuous attention in the field of financial education. Nielsen's " 2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report " and CCTV- 16's " 2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report " show that the young generation has a huge potential for consumption, and the consumption of credit products has become a means of consumption upgrading. 86.6% of the young generation use credit products, and nearly half of them do not have a debt accumulation. Although the young generation as a whole shows a trend towards rational consumption, the young generation's " overconsumption " and " follow the crowd " behaviors still exist, and because of this, some young people have developed a large amount of financial pressure and debt risk. As a result of this, social problems have begun to increase, and businesses should be willing to take on the responsibility of society.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always strived to provide high quality and caring services to help the people build their own happy lives and promote the formation of a correct and proper consumption mindset. it has also actively responded to the government's call to promote the formation of a correct and proper consumption mindset among the people, especially among the younger generation.
In the past decade, Jiexiang has repeatedly targeted young people, including university students, with a wide range of financial literacy awareness campaigns, and, through collaborations with China's top universities, launched a variety of initiatives, such as a financial literacy quiz, an entrepreneurship competition, and an entrepreneurship competition, all of which were aimed at influencing young people's consumption habits, encouraging them to develop a rational outlook on consumption, plan their consumption needs, and thereby assisting them in accumulating personal wealth.
In the run-up to Double 12, Jiexin reminded all consumers to cultivate a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct understanding of money, to resist impulsive and excessive consumption and to avoid entering the consumption debt zone, in order to avoid affecting one's personal credit record and one's future economic life.
Consumption time must be planned in advance, that is, it must be done in proportion to one's ability to pay back the debt on time..
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the individual's credit report, which may have a negative impact on his or her future economic life, such as buying a car or purchasing a house.
At the same time, while enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose legitimate institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have the necessary operating permits.
In the future, Jie Xin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and improved financial products to provide consumers with more tailored and diversified services, continuously assisting them in raising their level of financial knowledge, helping them to develop a rational approach to consumption and moderate borrowing practices, and making them their lifelong trustworthy partner in consumer finance.

Viet Nam People's Army Newspaper - The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is facing common challenges.
The Saudi king's visit included stops in Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Noteworthy is that this is the first time since Saudi Arabia and its Arab League allies imposed a ban on Qatar in 2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis, that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has visited Qatar.
In the midst of this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed their diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed an all--embracing trade embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
the tightening of diplomatic relations had a serious impact on the internal unity of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries closed all land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the 2021 January 1st Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit, when all GCC countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards " unity and stability " in the region.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors.
The resolution of the dispute between the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and Qatar, aimed at restoring relations between the countries based on their mutual interests and the stability of the region, is based on the need for the countries to unite in order to face common challenges.
During the Saudi King's visit to Oman, the two countries agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf nations.
The 725 km long roadway connecting the two countries will facilitate the outbound travel of the citizens of the two countries and the supply chain integration of the two countries.
The Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia will invest 500 million USD in Oman, and 300 million USD worth of 13 memorandums of understanding were signed between Omani and Saudi companies.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf Arab countries coincided with Iran's negotiations with the world's major countries to save the name of the " Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action " ( JCPOA ) - an agreement reached between Iran and the world's major countries because the Gulf Arab countries could not solve the issue of Iran's ballistic missiles.
The countries of the Persian Gulf have always viewed Iran as a long--term " rival " and have viewed Iran's nuclear program as a threat to the region's security.
The countries of the Persian Gulf believe that without resolving the issue of Iran's missiles, it is not possible to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the failure of the nuclear talks between the major powers and Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its objective is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming ASEAN summit will be the first of its kind since the dispute between some member countries and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to re-evaluate its efforts to promote cooperation among its member states, and at the same time propose a number of measures to ensure that its member states work together to meet common challenges in order to contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is claimed to be the new mountain area's fastest and loudest jet engine.
This time, the team brought this car to the public, which is many men's dream.
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago, the Aventador LP700-4.
A bargain price of 20 million rupees, a year's road tax of 11,000 rupees, four- wheeled drive, why it is called the LP700.
because it has 700 horsepower, one can imagine how fast it is.
That's it, even the small editor does not know, the data says that the acceleration from 0 to 100 km/ h only takes 2.9 seconds, approximately, the small editor's Myvi has to reach 30 km / h before the Myvi reaches 100 km / h. Yep.

There is no need to say too much about the car's specifications, it is enough to look it up on Google. the editor has compiled a list of some of the Google search results that are not conclusive.
Too much attention, going to where everyone is looking, very uncomfortable (in fact, it was quite enjoyable)
1km of fuel costs around RM1 ( the car owner doesn't care at all )
Getting in and out of the car requires practice, otherwise it can be a bit awkward ( because it is difficult to climb out of the car and get stuck halfway in )
The engine noise is too loud, after getting off the car, they will suddenly suffer from deafness. (but they are still very hot).)
The car body is too large, parking in a regular parking spot is very narrow, it is very afraid of being hit by the neighbor's car opening the door at that time.
There is a bit of loneliness, because there is no opponent on the road ( the small editor himself said, it has nothing to do with the car owner, ha ha ha )
Don't misunderstand, the supercar in the video is not for sale,, I'm sorry.

to make the spirit of a great university and the spirit of the times resonate at the same frequency - Xinhua News Agency
The so-called spirit of a great university is a set of academic principles and values that a great university has developed over a long period of time. these principles and values are the soul of a great university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been crucial to the development of politics, economics, culture, science and technology, as well as a nation's progress.
From the birth of the first modern university in the world, the mission of the university has been different from that of other social organizations. For China,, the university was born in the autumn of the national crisis, and its spirit has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changing of the times. It advocates the values of "promoting virtue and benefiting the world" and " strengthening science and strengthening the country. "
At present, the trend towards informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more apparent, and the global competition for education, science and technology, and human resources is becoming more and more intense. The higher education sector, which is one of the most important " supply side " of education, is undergoing a structural reform that is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the issuance of the " Overall plan for comprehensively advancing the construction of world--class universities and world--class academic disciplines " has shown China's confidence and determination to move from a great country in higher education to a strong country in higher education. At the same time, it has also set higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
to become one of the world's top universities in a relatively short period of time, while still lagging behind in some areas, and to accelerate the construction of a number of world--class universities and a number of world--class academic disciplines.
In addition to the unwavering self--confidence in the goal, in the path, and in the ability,, the universities should also make full use of three types of advantages: the advantage of being a latecomer, the advantage of borrowing the experience of the world's top universities, and the advantage of the country's socialist system. The universities should make use of the advantage of being a latecomer to hire overseas outstanding academic talent, learn from the experience of the world's top universities, and improve their academic and educational quality. The universities should also make use of the advantage of the country's socialist system to rally around a common goal, pool their resources, improve their image, and make use of the country's socialist system's inherent superiority.
In particular, it is important to note that building a world--class university cannot be done by a hundred schools, each of which has to play to its strengths, while at the same time developing its own identity and character.
The school's special characteristics must have a common Chinese characteristic, while also reflecting each school's unique objectives, educational traditions and resource endowment.
In the case of Zhejiang University,, it has emphasized the development of three aspects of its distinctive characteristics: one is the distinctive characteristics of the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talent, the construction of a science- education integration and a school- industry collaboration environment, the formation of a complete chain of innovative and entrepreneurial education and the establishment of an innovative and entrepreneurial education ecosystem; two is the distinctive characteristics of the cultivation of science disciplines, the optimization of the science disciplines system, the establishment of an innovative and entrepreneurial science disciplines environment, and the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial science disciplines and innovative and entrepreneurial science disciplines breakthroughs; and three is the distinctive characteristics of the bureaucracy and social services, the deepening of international cooperation and collaboration, and the formation of a wide-- ranging Zhejiang University bureaucracy and social services body.
During this process, it is especially important to keep the spirit of the university alive, to make the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For the part of Zhejiang University, "seeking truth and pursuing knowledge" is the school motto, " diligence, morality, discernment and perseverance " constitute the common value system, and " welcoming the sea and embracing the river, cultivating true virtue, opening up the frontiers of knowledge, and building a prosperous homeland " constitute the most recent expression of the Zhejiang University spirit.
This is the school's commitment to upholding the correct path of education, continuously accumulating a high level of culture and consolidating the spirit of unity. it is rich in meaning and has a profound impact.
Among them, the " Sea of ​​ the River " emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, which expresses the spirit of " taking the world's best and brightest as one's own " and the spirit of " taking the world's best and brightest as one's own " and the spirit of " taking the world ' s best and brightest as one ' s own " and the spirit of " taking the world ' s best and brightest as one ' s own " and the spirit of " taking the world ' s best and brightest as one ' s own " and the spirit of " taking the world ' s best and brightest as one ' s own " and the spirit of " taking the world ' s best and brightest as one ' s own " and the spirit of " taking the world ' s best and brightest as one ' s own " and the spirit of " taking the world ' s best and brightest as one ' s own " and the spirit of " taking the world ' s best and brightest as one ' s own " and the spirit of " taking the world ' s best and brightest as one ' s own " and the spirit of " taking the world '
This series of spiritual ideals and value pursuits is exactly what makes the 120 years of Wenzhou University's existence.
"The wise hear without hearing, the intelligent see without sight. "
China's universities should continue to focus on the overall development of the socialist society with Chinese characteristics, deepen their understanding of the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world--class university.
At the same time, it is committed to upholding the values of humanity and independence, thereby allowing the spirit of a great university and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation, and the spirit of mankind to intermingle, thus providing an inexhaustible source of energy for achieving the prosperity of the country and the rejuvenation of the nation and the realization of the common aspirations of mankind.

A group of Asian American students have filed complaints against Yale, Princeton, and other members of the elite group of eight colleges known as the " Ivy League " for discriminating against them in the admissions process.
On May 23, the New China News Agency reported that 130 Asian American groups submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice protesting that three of the nation's most prestigious liberal arts colleges, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian American applicants in their admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance held a news conference in Washington, D.C. on the day of the filing of the lawsuit.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yulong, said at a press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission criteria of American top universities increased by the hundreds, but in these three American top universities, the proportion of Asians remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these elite universities engage in long--term, systematic discrimination against Asian- American applicants in their admissions process.
According to Zhao Yulong,, in 2014, research by Sander and other scholars showed that among these three universities, the acceptance rate for Asian Americans was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
The data from the US Department of Education also show that among all the members of the Association of the Eight Ivy League universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest acceptance rate for Asian students, while Yale University and Brown University had the lowest acceptance rate for Asian applicants for 20 years or more.
Zhao Yulong told a reporter from the Xinhua News Agency that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would investigate and, after determining the facts, take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students.
They also hoped that colleges and universities would actively address this issue and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
As of now, the 3 universities that have been sued have yet to respond.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it filed a complaint against Harvard University's admissions process, but the U.S. Department of Education ruled that the process was not discriminatory.
This time, in addition to the American Chinese group, the American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani American educational group participated in the petition.

In September 2020, Mr. Lai learned from a real estate agent about a factory building located in the Beizhou Town of Yueyang County in Zhejiang Province. After several visits to the site, Mr. Lai decided to buy the factory building.
On the same day, Mr. Lai negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory with the owner of the house, Lin Xiang, and transferred 20 million yuan as a deposit to the bank.
Lin Xiang signed the receipt of the deposit contract as the recipient of the deposit money. It stated that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit money would go to the seller, and if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit money would be doubled back to the seller, and the two parties agreed to sign a factory purchase contract within a week.
However, the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the terms of the contract for the sale and purchase of the factory, and the contract for the sale and purchase of the factory was delayed for a long time..
Giving consideration to the fact that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the terms of the contract, a few days later, Lin Xiang returned 2 million yuan of the deposit to Mr. Lai.
After a long search, the house was found, the deposit was paid, the money for the house was also ready, all that was left was to sign the contract, but the seller changed his mind and refused to sell the house. This made Mr. Lai angry and frustrated.
For this reason, Mr. Liu sued Mr. Lin to the Beiluo District People's Court.
The court, after reviewing the case, concluded that the two parties were not able to sign a formal contract and that the defendant was not solely responsible for the breakdown of negotiations, and that the case should not apply the double the deposit penalty clause, and that the defendant did not have to pay double the deposit as compensation for the breach of contract.
After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed.
In recent days, the second court of appeal upheld the original verdict.
The lawyer warns that in the course of a transaction, it is necessary to pay attention to the duty to exercise due diligence.
When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is the buyer's duty to exercise due diligence, such as verifying the owner of the property, whether the property is occupied by someone else, and so on. The contract should also specify the exact time and place of the delivery of the property to avoid disputes between the two parties.
After the end of the " People's Democracy Summit " on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Sunday (11 December) that the United States hosted the " Leadership Summit of the People's Democracy " , which was " using ideology as a dividing line, turning democracy into a weapon, using the name of democracy to carry out anti-- democratic acts, stirring up divisions, diverting domestic tensions " 。
The Chinese government believes that " for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and its own value system on others, imposed " democratic transformation " on others, implemented single-- sided sanctions, instigated " color revolutions " and caused catastrophic consequences.
" democracy " has already become the US's " weapon of mass destruction " to interfere in the affairs of other countries.
This biannual summit is a fulfillment of Biden's election pledge.
The two--day conference was held in a video format and was attended by the leaders of 111 countries, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
Internationally and in the United States, there are also doubts about the motives of those invited to attend the summit, including some of the leaders of authoritarian regimes, such as those of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, who are suspected of having ulterior motives that are not for the sake of democracy, but for the sake of geopolitical interests.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is sick, the politics of money, the politics of identity, the politics of the political parties, the politics of polarization, the politics of extremism, the social fissures, the racial tensions and the poverty-- rich divide are becoming more acute. " The American democracy is based on the foundation of the politics of money, the politics of identity, the politics of the political parties, the politics of polarization, the politics of extremism, the social fissures, the racial tensions and the poverty - rich divide.
US President Barack Obama said in his speech that " as government leaders, they have a responsibility to listen to their citizens, strengthen the democratic shield, push for reform, achieve transparency in governance, and more effectively resist the pressure and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who seek power before the interests of the public. "
He stressed that democracy is not a given, "In my view, this is the defining challenge of this generation, to constantly renew it in every generation of people ," he said.
Mr. Biden also said that " democracy and human rights " are facing " persistent and worrying challenges " at a time when " democracy needs champions to defend it " .
The US side pledged to launch a one--year campaign after the Democratic Summit, including a $424 million initiative to strengthen democracy in the world and to support independent news media.
The United States hopes that each country will make a specific, public commitment before the end of 2022 to improve its democratic system.
Biden said, " Let's make sure that all countries fulfill their commitments and report their progress by the end of next year " 。
I'm afraid he sent the letter to the wrong address.

The red card drinking law is what.
Everyone's hobbies are different. Some like collecting, some like fine food, and some like drinking whisky. Of course, there are also those who like to drink whisky. Red Label is currently the best--selling Scottish whisky in many countries, and it won the gold medal at the international whisky competition.
Every bottle of red label whisky has its own distinct taste, but if one does not know how to savour it, it would be a waste of its sweet aroma..
So, how to drink red card whisky.
For the sake of simplicity, the small editor will explain it to the readers..
The red card drinking law is as follows:
The biodiesel is made from about 35 varieties of Scottish whisky, and has a distinctive pungent aroma with hints of sweetness and smokiness.
The entrance is rich in ethanol, with a slight hint of grass and a strong smell of burnt malt.
The alcohol can be directly mixed with ice to be used as a drink, or mixed with the most liked drink to be used as a drink.
Red- carded whisky enters the country, in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, red- carded whisky mixed with carbonated beverages such as Coca- Cola or Fanta became a long- lasting fashion.
Theses sweet- tasting beverages, apart from being able to neutralize the acidic taste,, in the visual sense, can give people a sense of pleasure, by adding them to the beverages, they have the effect of neutralizing the taste of alcohol and changing the taste of the mouth.
The combination of red wine, a slice of lime and sugar is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it. (sandsugar can also be used).
The original red wine has a slightly acidic taste, the addition of sugar can neutralize its acidic taste, lime juice can give the wine a fresh aroma, of course, the sweetness of the acidic taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
All three of these are the best ways to drink the red- carded whisky, and people can use them as a reference to try them out. The editor hopes that his explanation will help people.

In the case of a group with so many different characteristics, it is inevitable that there will be different perceptions of the situation.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type and are repeated too often, they are too simple, they will give rise to a different kind of feeling.
The lazy student may be able to get a passing grade by studying hard before the exams,, but if he wants to try other ways, he may be able to achieve the effect of doubling the effect of half the effort..
As a result, " study slackers " who do not put much effort into their studies are able to pass their exams and even achieve high grades. " study superstars " who do not miss classes, homework, and notebooks are able to pass their exams and even achieve high grades.
It can be inferred that the students of Lanzhou University of Aeronautics and Astronautics did not protest the university entrance exam for no reason. It can be inferred that this kind of situation also exists in Lanzhou University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
From this perspective, it is necessary to give a thumbs- up to the three students who wrote the open letter.
In fact, those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university are well aware of the fact that those who have graduated from university
In the author's view, the quality of a university's examinations can be judged by the extent to which its professors are able to comprehensively understand the relationship between teaching and learning, as well as the extent to which they are able to formulate scientific questions.
Entering the bachelor's degree at the university, the specialty begins to specialize, many specialty courses are based on basic knowledge..
There is no doubt that whether or not the basic knowledge points of a particular field of study have been mastered is what is examined in university entrance examinations.
On the other hand, undergraduate knowledge is based on the foundations of the respective disciplines and basic common knowledge. in terms of knowledge points, there is not much variation, they are basically fixed..
just like what a teacher said, " 20 years ago, the basic knowledge of university- level mathematics was the same as now, and it is still being studied. it is still a focus. "
However, the knowledge points remain the same and do not represent a single type of test question or a repetition of test questions.
In many universities, examinations are generally composed of test papers, which are then scrutinized by a committee of professors, and the exam papers are then scrutinized by a committee of professors. In this way, a certain degree of repetition of test papers can be avoided.
However, it is necessary to devise a set of test questions that are in line with the realities of teaching and learning, that are based on the actual situation of the student's study, that have a normal distribution of difficulty, that also take into account the overall situation of the student's study, and that are based on a comprehensive assessment of the situation of the teacher's teaching and the overall situation of the student's study, thereby making it possible to devise test questions that take into account the difficulty of the test and the type of the test, while at the same time taking into account the assessment of the basics of knowledge and the assessment of the student's ability, while at the same time making it possible to devise test questions that take into account the assessment of the basics of knowledge and the assessment of the student's ability, while at the same time making it possible to devise test questions that take into account the assessment of the basics of knowledge and the assessment of the student's ability, while at the same time making it possible to devise test questions that take into account the assessment of the basics of knowledge and the assessment of the student's ability
The university entrance exam is the baton of university education. the nature of the university entrance exam determines the nature of the preparation for the entrance exam. if this continues, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The suggestion letter from the students was taken seriously by the Fujian University of Technology and Applied Sciences campus authorities, who have implemented a comprehensive rectification plan across the entire campus.
To require all teaching units to organize lecturers to carry out research and classroom examinations and to compare them with self--examinations, to draft examination papers and related regulations, at the same time to strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination paper drafting and reviewing phases, to fine--tune the scoring and grading process, and to strengthen the assessment of all teaching phases.
From the perspective of the mechanism, solving the problem of a single type of test and the repetition of the same test is a problem that the university examination service needs to deal with., of course, it is necessary to enact the corresponding regulations,, but the hard work lies in the daily routine. It is necessary for the teachers to have a full grasp of the situation in the classroom, not only to eat through the content of the curriculum, but also to eat through the situation of the student's study. The two sides eating through each other will form a better interaction between teaching and learning, and the test will be more in line with the actual situation, so that the "studious student" and the " studious slacker " will get what they deserve.

The Sandakan National Registration Office said that because of the special anti- counterfeiting paper used for the stamps, it was unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October. As a result, 3,200 people have been affected.

At a press conference, he addressed the issue of the newspaper's paper and printing problems, which lasted for more than 10 months, by making a clarification.

The New China News Agency in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, reported on December 11, that the President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Krešić said that the Bosnia and Herzegovina was looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and was confident that China would be able to organize a successful Winter Olympics in a special time period.
A few days ago, the Chinese ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Tie Ping, met with the president of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Krešić.
At the time of the meeting, Čelović positively evaluated the relations between the two countries and said that he had visited China in 2008, during the Olympic Games in Beijing, and that he was impressed by China's excellent organizational work, and that he believed that China had the ability to organize the Olympic Games well in a special time period.

Čelović said that he hoped to use this as an opportunity to expand the scope of cooperation between the two countries in the field of sports.
Cui Ping said that China and Poland have a special " Olympic bridge " between them.
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were a success here, and two months later, in 2022, the Beijing Winter Olympics will be held here and will present the world with a simple, safe and spectacular event.

48 hours of nucleic acid negative results, set up a " buffer zone " - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency - Xinhua News Agency
The Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11 December 2012 (reporters Dong Renbo and Tian Tengcheng) The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a notice on 11 December 2012 to strengthen the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in borderline coastal cities ( those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirement was from the date that each province, autonomous region, and municipality determined the port city area and announced it, to March 15,, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that conditional port cities can study setting up quarantine areas for the prevention and control of infectious diseases within their jurisdictions.
The National Health and Family Planning Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau said that for some border cities, cross-- border trade is the main economic pillar of the city, and people from both sides of the border go back and forth frequently.
It implements a differential management policy based on the division of districts, from one line of defense against outbreaks to two lines of defense, with the aim of moving the front line of infection control forward, compressing the risk of outbreaks, and achieving the maximum effect of infection control with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
In recent times, there have been many outbreaks of local epidemics in China, all of which were transmitted through the mouth of the border city.
The above--mentioned notice points out that this exposed some shortcomings in the early detection of epidemic outbreaks, inadequate management of high--risk personnel, irregular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of cold chain goods, inadequate management of quarantine facilities, inadequate handling of epidemic outbreaks, and inadequate management of quarantine facilities.
The notice called for, from strengthening the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epidemics in border cities, completing the prevention and control of epide
The notice stressed that all border city municipalities should carry out epidemic prevention and citizen welfare protection work in parallel, publish and facilitate the citizen welfare protection hotline, periodically inspect the supply of basic necessities of life, prices, and other aspects, to quickly resolve and respond to the public's emerging problems.
According to the notice, the cities with open land and water routes, airports, counties (cites, districts, autonomous prefectures) in which they are located, the cities ( districts, autonomous prefectures, autonomous regions ) in which they are located and the special administrative districts in which they are located are among the cities with open land and water routes, airports, and the counties (cites, districts, autonomous prefectures ) in which they are located, the cities ( districts, autonomous prefectures, autonomous regions ) in which they are located and the special administrative districts in which they are located. The provinces ( autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, autonomous prefectures ) have to determine and announce the specific areas according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.
Color : like the color of the photograph ( color discrepancy is unavoidable, the color of the real object is the closest to the color of the garment, the color of the garment can become brighter due to the outdoor lighting, the color of the garment should be checked before purchase. )
This product is a vintage item, the first time a vintage item is purchased, the buyer should look up the word "vintage" or " antique " in the Baidu dictionary.
loneliness.
A single piece of ancient clothing will inevitably have small imperfections, so if one decides to buy a single piece of ancient clothing, one must have this kind of preparation in mind. If one is a perfectionist, one should be cautious, and the more obvious of these imperfections will be explained by the seller, which is a characteristic of ancient clothing. The individual believes that good things do not have to be perfect, and does not care about these small imperfections.
In the shop, old products are not returned or exchanged..
So--called vintage, antique, design all carry a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era, also known as a wistful yearning for the past. This is also the reason why vintage clothing is so popular, as well as the quality of the clothing.
However, some inexperienced young women do not know how to handle themselves and cannot say that the clothes are old--fashioned, they can only say that they are not suitable.
There is absolutely no resistance to the risk of shopping on the Internet, shopping on the Internet is risky, shopping needs to be done with caution..
If the item is not suitable for the buyer, he does not like it, and so on,, the shop owner can take it off the shelf and sell it. Once it is sold, it cannot be withdrawn or exchanged. people should cooperate.
On June 11,, 2021, part of the circle was sold.
Looking good, numbered down to order, antique goods are sold out without refunds or exchanges.

Oil pipeline video reveals the truth of the US military's 20 years of bloodthirsty killings - Xinhua News Agency.
( video source from oil pipeline )
On 11 December 2011, the oil pipeline platform posted a micro documentary called "Killing Machine" which attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States, under the guise of fighting terrorism, waged a war in Afghanistan for 20 years, through which it tried to forcefully export American- style democracy. Through 20 years of war, the United States committed numerous crimes against humanity.
The indiscriminate use of drone air strikes on hospitals, schools and other civilian sites has twisted human nature, established a kill squad.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up " black jails " to subject detainees to various forms of torture and humiliation.
A series of crimes against humanity has led to more Afghans hating each other.
Just as the video says, the American " war on terror " is " more and more terrifying " 。
The war in Afghanistan has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity and hope to the people of Afghanistan. It has only brought destruction to the country and countless acts of violence.
Let's watch the video together to expose the true nature of the United States, which uses the pretext of anti--terrorism to slaughter innocent people, expose the false face of American democracy.
Inadvertently, he saw the following article, from a commercial perspective as well as from the perspective of the preservation period, talking about why this customer wants to have the inland container terminal's logistics company help with canister filling, even though canister filling is considered deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the inland container terminal's logistics company. This article may also explain why the customer wants to do this.
He went to many milk powder factories and saw many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the powdered milk formula and the pouched milk formula are the same. there is no difference between them.
So naturally, people will ask why the bagged product has a shelf life of one year, while the canned product has a shelf life of two years or more.
or, they ask why the difference in price is so great between the two types of packaging.
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or motherly in nature, believe that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality is much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but people believe that the more expensive ones are the better ones.
There are also consumers who have this mindset who eat it afterward and say that the taste or flavor of the food is different.
First of all, I would like to say to the audience that the reason for the hearing loss is that it is located in the ears.
Their raw materials are the same, but the difference in price is so great.
Because the manufacturer considers the price at the time of determining the price, most of them consider that if the bagged price is too high, consumers find it difficult to accept, which means that the manufacturer's profit is very low, or that there is no profit at all. This means that the manufacturer relies on what to survive.
This means that they were able to increase their profit margins by a large amount due to the large increase in the price of their tickets.
As a result, the majority of manufacturers are promoting the use of hearing aids, rather than the use of earplugs.
and there are so many factories that spend a few hundred million or even a few billion yuan each year on advertising. where this money comes from.
Everyone can imagine it for themselves.
With the development of society and the promotion of the market, expenditures, for example, such as the salaries of promoters in shopping malls, the expenditures on displays in shopping malls, the expenditures on freebies, advertising expenditures, and so on, are increasing continuously.
So, each manufacturer is continuously releasing new products, which are all ready--made, and their prices are continuously rising, which is due to the increase in production costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the increase in raw material costs will not exceed 3 to 4 rupees.
There is also a part of the brand that, in order to promote its own product, does not hesitate to resort to any means, to hook up with a doctor at a hospital and have him help promote the product, from which it earns a profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan, depending on the quality of the product.
However, China's relevant laws prohibit this type of operating method. In fact, this type of operating method is in violation of the rights of consumers.
It is suggested that people who have cans at home should buy powdered milk in bags and put it into the cans. this way, they can save money and increase the durability and sealability of the powdered milk. there is no adverse effect on small children.
Also, people should not think that the shelf life of the bags is longer than that of the tubes, as the shelf life of the bags is the same as that of the tubes after the bags are opened. The bags are not as easy to preserve as the tubes after they are opened, they are susceptible to moisture.
The lunch was late, the food was all cold, it was cold after that, it was hard and stiff, there was no way to eat it.
and the soup also spilled out.

Don't scare people to death at the starting line - Xinhua News Agency
When visiting the book market, it is often possible to feel the success of the "how- to succeed" type of books.
Today's best-selling self--help books are full of " best practices " — that is, they assume or imply that the reader can " do it " and then go on to tell the reader " what to do " .
This is equivalent to saying that he jumped over the "how to do it" part, which is actually the most important and fundamental part.
This is the reason why all these books have a common feature: they either try to do their best or they try to do nothing at all. They either try to climb to the top of the mountain or they try to stay in the same place. They either try to score 100 points or they try to score 0 points. They either try to climb to the top of the mountain or they try to stay in the same place. They either try to score 100 points or they try to score 0 points.
This principle of " the best of the best " ， which makes everyone agree that it is " absolutely correct " , but 99% of people will be scared off before the starting line.
because this theory is based on the idea that one has to make a " 180- degree turn " in one's life, and this is something that many people are unable to do.
For those who insist on sticking to old ways of doing things, you have to shout in their ears " they have to change " , which is self--deception and an act of foolishness.
The overwhelming majority of people will face the two--word phrase "turnover" with trepidation, hesitate to take a step forward, and hesitate to make a final decision. They may or may not make a decision based on a momentary impulse, and then courageously take the first step, but they often fail to hold out for more than a few minutes and give up.
Mr. Ma's famous " From tomorrow onwards " skit from the film " From tomorrow onwards " perfectly illustrated this " universal human nature " in a classic way.
The biggest problem with the " most important principle " is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, leaving them " gaping at the door in despair " 。
or perhaps, " second- best principles " are a kind of path that can lead more ordinary people to relative success.
The core of the " second good principle " lies in " lowering the threshold " — — it encourages a theory of " accumulating small victories as big victories " — that is, if one does not reach 100, it is enough to reach 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if one does not climb to the top of Mount Tai, it is enough to climb to the top of the small sand dune in front of one's house, because it is always greater than the original place of standing.
In the end, doing something is better than not doing anything..
Due to the lowering of the threshold, the possibility of ordinary people to persist has increased, and so has the likelihood of success. All that is required is perseverance, and the likelihood of success will increase.
Only following the " second best principles " of success, its path is slightly longer than that of success.
In the end, the " best " principle, although it flies the banner of making all people successful, can only motivate a small number of people. On the other hand, the " second best " principle can motivate more people to benefit as much as possible.
Now, whether it is necessary to re-order.
The telephone is not manned.
no end to the delay.
it has not yet been sent.
When it will be delivered.

The stock of the Qinghai Lake carp resource increased by 71,000 tonnes this year - Xinhua News Agency.
The New China News Agency reported on December 11, 2012 from the Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the Province of Qinghai that the latest monitoring results showed that the stockpile of the Qinghai Lake Amur carp resource has increased by 71,000 tons compared to the previous year and reached 1.085 million tons, which is 40 times more than the initial protection period in 2002.
The naked trout, also known as the Laba River fish, is a rare fish species found in the waters of Lake Qinghai. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological chain of water, fish and birds in the Qinghai River basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, as a result of large--scale fishing, the environment around the lake deteriorated and the population of the lake trout declined sharply. In 2002, the stock of lake trout in the lake was only 2,592 tonnes.
In the 2004 edition of the Chinese Red List of Endangered Species, the greenback cutthroat trout was listed as an endangered species.
Since 2003, the province of Qinghai has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main tributaries, prohibiting any organization, collective, or individual from fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main tributaries. The ban also prohibits the sale of fish from Qinghai Lake and its tributaries.
At the same time, through artificial breeding release and cleaning up of the main inflowing rivers of Qinghai Lake, as well as designing scientific and reasonable " fish passages " and other measures, the protection efforts for the Qinghai Lake sturgeon resource have been stepped up year after year.
The Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin said that as of now, more than 180 million juvenile fish have been released into the waters of Qinghai Lake, contributing to the restoration of the Qinghai Lake carp resource at a rate of more than 23 percent.

In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Springs area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, to protect the water wildlife of the Three Rivers Springs area and to protect the biodiversity of the Qinghai- Tibet Plateau, since the beginning of this year, Qinghai has successively issued a notice banning fishing in the Three Rivers Springs area, a notice banning fishing in the Yellow River and a notice banning fishing in Qinghai Lake. It has established a "one river, one river, one lake" comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

I just saw an example of a fake article that was too long..
Giving a male science popularization to a man who does not know anything about it.
The vast majority of female teenagers will experience their first period between the ages of 13 and 15 at some point during that period, and menopause usually occurs between the ages of 50.
In the case of a healthy person, menstruation will occur more or less regularly every month.
However, it is not regular enough to be able to accurately predict for a week or two in advance, with a margin of error of about a week. it needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes bad luck also causes a flip-flop (suddenly having to leave earlier than a few days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, the intensity of the menstruation varies from person to person, some people for three days, some people for a week; some people bleed little, some people bleed a lot; some people do not have any reaction, some people are so painful that they need to be transported by ambulance; the intensity of the menstruation changes with time, what was not painful before does not necessarily mean that it will not be painful in the future.
The menstruation is not able to be controlled, begins to end in a few days, 24 hours of continuous flow of blood, the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or sanitary cotton rods to absorb the blood to prevent it from flowing onto clothes, chairs.
Menstrual pain is mainly caused by the release of prostaglandin, the first phase of the menstrual cycle has not yet started, it is too late to relieve menstrual pain by eating birth control pills. Menstrual pain starts after the first phase of the menstrual cycle, eating birth control pills has no effect.
During the premenstrual period, the uterus is filled with blood and progesterone is released in excess, making it easy to get a stomach ache.
If the period is overdue, for no apparent reason, the stomach starts to ache within two days, and the menstruation comes within two days.
A sanitary napkin should be changed every two to three hours, not otherwise, it is easy to breed bacteria. The worst case is to change a sanitary napkin 6 times a day for one day, 7 times a month, which is 42 pads, not counting the pre-packed pads.
(Here, it is necessary to modify a bit, the change of the sanitary cotton rods is not necessary to be done constantly, five or six hours is enough, the longest is eight hours. )
During the menstrual period, the hormone hormone may be more aggressive, the ovulation period may also be affected because of the hormonal changes in the body, causing the body to be unstable. that is very unlucky, the body is giving itself a hard time.
However, official crime statistics show that women still have a high ability to control their emotions and do not use emotional problems as an excuse.
The flow is not only blood, it includes the shedding of the endometrium.
After the end of the menstruation, the thickness of the endometrium is the thinnest, it gradually thickens, which can be understood as the uterus is like a house, every month it builds a new house ( the endometrium thickens ) to welcome guests, but the guests do not come, so the whole thing is dismantled ( the menstrual blood is expelled ) and a new house is built again the next month.
The menstrual cycle is very inconvenient, it has been going on for several decades, every month for a few days 24 hours a day there is blood flowing, there is also abdominal pain and pains in the lower back., who wants it.
However, human beings are able to be born because their mothers have menstruated. Menstruation is for the purpose of preparing the body for the first time to be born into this world. people should thank their mothers for having regular menstruation.
In the past, many aspects of women's lives were repressed, society brainwashed women into believing that they were dirty and shameful, but the times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is bad, feels that the female body is preparing for the birth of a new life, it should not be said in the open in the presence of a large audience. The young girls stood up and said that they should not think this way, that they have never experienced it, and that they do not understand the men. They should not have this attitude towards their mothers, and they should not have this attitude towards their children.
Lastly, sisters should try using sanitary pads. they are really useful..
Today is the day of the winter solstice, it is customary to send gifts that disappoint people.
To order a separate meal for the children to eat.
I hope that shopkeepers, who are so busy,, will take a look at the product.
A footbath basin is not leaking electricity.
Choosing a suitable footbath basin can have a very good effect on foot therapy, and today, the small editor of the People's Republic of China will explain this issue. I hope that this will be helpful to friends.
As people's awareness of their health has increased, the popularity of the footbath has grown, and in the market, a wide variety of footbaths, ranging in price from 100 yuan to 1,000 yuan, have emerged, giving consumers a wide range of choices.
In terms of related data, the sales of footbaths and other health- related household appliances are booming compared to traditional household appliances, but footbaths do not have a specialized industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk.
" to swim in electrically charged water is too dangerous. "
Mr. Li told the reporter that he bought a footbath basin as a birthday gift for his father, but when his father bathed his feet, he felt his feet go numb.
At first, Mr. Li thought that it was the vibrations of the footbath that caused the sensation, but he did not think that the vibrations were turned off and his father still felt the sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li used an electric pencil to test it, to his surprise, the electric pencil lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the footbath was electrically charged.
Later, he contacted shop owners, shop owners' attitude was not bad, although he had to give up the foot bath basin, Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied.
Because of this, this ancient footbath basin, which has been in use for a long time, is now set at the highest temperature, and is suitable for all kinds of people, all kinds of materials, and is free of harm in many ways. However, there is no clear and detailed industry regulation for any of these aspects.
However, in general, the foot bath basin does not have an electrical problem, but it is not excluded that a small number of products, when leaving the factory, were not subjected to strict quality control.
As a result, at the time of purchase, he chose a separate foot bath basin.
The separation of water and electricity has no safety concerns.
At the same time, he can take an electrical pen test at will.

The tea industry experts in the province say that after the harvest of green tea, the harvest of red tea and black tea will provide the tea farmers with income throughout the year, and the production value of the tea plantation will rise in a straight line.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises granted the right to use the "Lushan Red Tea" trademark, as well as the "Lushan Red Tea" trademark.
In the new tea exhibition hall in Fujian, tea merchants from Fujian signed a contract for a high mountain tea called "Iced Spring" on the spot.

The branch of metaphysics called "form and substance" includes, among other things, the doctrine of the natural god, and the problem of its extension.
The body theory is " the study of which nouns represent real entities, and which nouns only represent a concept. "
Formalist metaphysics, which denies the existence of God.

Ding Zi Liang : Letter to a friend.
This person sincerely thanks all his friends and relatives for the help they have given him over the past 30-plus years, especially since he appealed for humanitarian assistance in his name in 1994.
Nowadays, the vast majority of the victims' old parents have already passed away, the orphans have also grown up and become independent.
It is their generosity that has helped them through the most difficult time of their lives..
At present, the new coronavirus epidemic is wreaking havoc all over the world, and most of the donors have reached the age of retirement.
Therefore, I plead with them to stop giving money to the Tiananmen Square mothers group, the humanitarian aid activity that should have ended long ago.
I will forever remember their love and believe that their good deed will be recorded in history..
Due to various reasons, he can only express his intention in this way, and asks his friends to understand.
I offer his sincere blessing.
The Tao Bureau said: Let me use this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32- year history of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation (MCDF) in carrying out humanitarian assistance.
In the process of conducting humanitarian relief efforts, the American Red Cross and the Minnesota- Dakota Chinese Democratic Foundation are two parallel organizations, the project's implementers often have overlapping responsibilities.

Assistance funds are often not able to be delivered to the hands of the victims of the June 4th incident..
In 1994, after the suggestion of Mr. Ding, a special committee was established by the "Mothers of Tiananmen Square" to coordinate and supervise the receipt and distribution of relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the " June 4th Orphan Education Fund " and, after 11 years, in 2009, when all of the June 4th orphans had graduated from university, MCDF set up the " June 4th Orphan Aid Fund for the elderly " and has continued to operate to this day.
The funding for these projects came mainly from donations from the 1989 campus and society fundraising, from individual donations, and from the support of the Tsinghua University Democratic Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre had not received any compensation for 31 years, until they finally received part of the donations raised in Hong Kong in the name of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.
During this period, the China Human Rights Defenders also carried out their humanitarian aid project independently.
We understand that Professor Ding's call for a halt to the 6/4 donation is for the benefit of the donor, and that they are not as wealthy as they were before retirement. This is also the case for Professor Ding's "thank you" letter to his " friend " .
They will respect the decision of the people of Hong Kong, to end the project within two years, and, if necessary, immediately reinstate it.
For those who have been steadfastly contributing to humanitarian aid for many years, risking their lives, they deserve to be thanked and respected.

This photography workshop is really great. it is highly recommended for all small friends to attend..
No matter from reception, make-up, costumes, lighting, photography to post--production, there is nothing to criticize..
The make-up artist is particularly meticulous, he chooses make-up that is appropriate to the style of the person, and uses make-up products from the first line of major brands.
Tian Liang, the teacher, is not even worth mentioning. photography is a very specialized field..
The entire workshop has an artistic atmosphere, and there are also two small cats playing around..
They are working in Beijing, the best film studios in Beijing need to reserve half a year in advance to stand in line, one of their colleagues was shooting in Beijing and looked at the finished film and thought it was just so- so.
He specifically sought out this workshop, a place with a soul and attitude.
Their facial expression management is poor, they also believe that this is the short version of most people, the photographer, bright boy will take pictures and record the natural and brilliant moment.
a makeup artist, a photographer, a post--production designer, a skilled team.

He has already recommended a girlfriend in the past, and his girlfriend was also very happy with the film..
I hope that this kind of workshop will not be forgotten, that more people will discover it, and that they will be able to develop their own distinctive style..

I want to know how to give money.
The delivered lunch has already been delivered.
there was no bicycle courier to receive it.
Now the restaurant staff are giving me a phone call.
a programming novice who wants to share his experience.
If one intends to enter this industry, it is possible to choose to go to a place for training. However, if one does not have this intention, it is still better to study on one's own. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it also takes six months to study.
However, for those who are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with low self--control and weak people. Training is indeed a very good choice..
If the person's self--sufficiency is strong, he or she can also choose to study on his or her own,, but it will be more exhausting.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
The first thing to look at is the strength of the faculty of this training institution. if the strength of the faculty is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning at all. Of course, some new training institutions do not have a particularly strong faculty.
Secondly, before choosing a tutoring institution, it is advisable to find out about the institution's graduates. After all, only the graduates of the institution know how good or bad the institution is.
Hello, in fact, he himself did not know how to answer this question, because he did not make a certain introduction about his own situation, and the study of this thing and his own situation has a very big relationship.
For example, specialization, age, the language one wants to study, even the city in which one wants to study it, all have a connection to one's field of study or the profession one wants to pursue.
If he is a student and has not yet graduated,, or if he is a computer science graduate who has already graduated,, then if he has enough time, he should study on his own,, which is the most efficient and cost--effective way. Now, there are a lot of in--person and online tutoring institutions that are actually very good,, but the cost of learning is high, and the amount of time required to learn is also high, and it takes 3 to 6 months of intensive training.
However, if it was me who said these things, self--study is very convenient. there are a lot of free study resources available on the internet, and there are also a lot of study resources available on b- stations. if he does not know where to find the resources, he can contact me and obtain free resources, or he can ask for more detailed advice.
There are also a number of classic books that can be combined with video to study in a more comprehensive way..
If he is not a computer science specialist, but is able to pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, he is advised to go to a training institution to study. This way, studying does not require a lot of effort, the lecturer's explanation is very detailed, there are people who specialize in solving problems, and there is also help in terms of study planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal hiring quotas, and recommend students to companies after they have completed their studies. As a result, the process of finding a job after graduation is also much easier..
The above are some of my views, which were not detailed because he did not know the situation of the person he was talking to. However, if he had any other thoughts he wanted to discuss, he could contact him at any time to exchange views.
1 point earlier, I had said that I had seen the same thing in all apps.
What is called
I haven't finished saying what I wanted to say yet, and he has done what he wanted to do..
Personally, he accepts all kinds of ( installation, cleaning, maintenance ) of boilers, hot water heaters, purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stove heads, oil smoke exhausts, lighting fixtures, cleaning glass, housekeeping services.
Thanks to those who silently gave him a thumbs up, for the sake of life, they struggled hard to make a living. Life is hard, but they have to continue.
Life does not punish every effort made by a person, and the person who likes it should pay attention to him, and the person who silently gives him a thumbs up should be thanked.
Life is like this. Others only look at the result, but the self---sustaining process. In the face of life, apart from being strong, the only option is to continue. The path can be turned back to look at, but cannot be turned back to walk. ...
Cleaning is work, it is also a duty, life is beautiful because of service and service is beautiful because of sincerity.
Although the job of a cleaner is the dirtiest, they do it with the most serious attitude, cleaning every nook and cranny of the customer's house until the customer is satisfied with a smile on his face and a raised index finger, at that moment, all the exhaustion is worth it, the effort is rewarded..
My daily work.
—— His request, his service.
With a sincere service, with a sincere cleaning, to keep the beauty.
The details that concern him, the housekeeping services provided by the Beijing Fangcheng family are " clean " and " love the house. "
To ensure that every house is clean, to build a family political banner, to serve to perfection and to keep the house clean.
indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work.
A crystal chandelier may be beautiful, but if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will lose its lustre and can only shine brightly after being cleaned. life is also like this.
In order to succeed, it is necessary to work hard, in order to create something beautiful, it is necessary to be meticulous; we are sincere.
Giving me a chance, there is no doubt that he will be satisfied with the quality, because the professional value deserves to be trusted, his recognition is the most encouraging for him..
The current situation in all fields of work is not good at all.
However, I still believe that as long as he is sincere in his approach, as long as he is determined, as long as he is determined, as long as he is determined, he will be better than others, at least better than those who sit around and complain. "
One day's fortune depends on the morning, all good things begin in the morning. Hope that he carries happiness, good luck, good health and good luck with him when he starts a new day and maintains a good mood throughout the day. Good morning.
As a child, happiness was a thing, having it made one happy; as an adult, happiness was a goal, achieving it made one happy; as an adult, one realised that happiness was a state of mind, understanding it made one happy..
To be the most authentic and good--natured version of oneself, to act according to one's heart, without regret for the present life; to have two treasures in one's life: a healthy body and a good mood, to live a lively life until old age.
Every stage of a person's life is marked by different challenges..
Often, it is not the lack of ability that binds one, but the courage to face it..
As there is no way to avoid it, it is better to face it boldly..
The more afraid he is, the more he will be overwhelmed by difficulties; the more he dares to face difficulties, problems will eventually be overcome..
The Saudi Arabian cultural center in Beijing, in cooperation with the Saudi Ministry of Culture, is organizing the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News Agency.
12 December 2012, the New China News Agency reported that the first Contemporary Art Biennale of Saudi Arabia was officially opened to the public on 11 December in the Dirab Art District of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries participated in the exhibition.
The 2010-2011 Saudi Arabia Diriyah Biennale was organized by the Saudi Arabia Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Contemporary Art Center in Beijing, China. UCCA Contemporary Art Center curator Ting Yuan was the artistic director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of the 2016/ 2017 biennial exhibition is " crossing the river by touching a stone " , which is a metaphor for the social and economic transformation strategy adopted during the current period of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This year's biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and consists of six exhibition halls, each of which is connected to each other. The exhibition is divided into six sections: " Touching the Stone to cross the river " " Art as an experiment " " Thinking on the edge " " Towards the public " " A beautiful new world " and " The spirit of art. "
In particular, 27 works by Saudi artists accounted for more than 40 percent of the total number of exhibited works, including paintings, installations and performance art. 12 works by Chinese artists also attracted attention, some of which used recycled materials in innovative ways, such as in the series of paintings in the " Back of the Story " series by Xu Bing titled " Skek Mountain " ( 2014 ) .
The chairman of the board of directors of the Dariyah Biennale Foundation, Barclay, said that he hoped that this biennale would be able to establish an international dialogue and give the global audience a chance to understand Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural industry and creative community and strengthen the exchange of visits.
Tianyuan Yu said: "The goal of the biennial exhibition is twofold: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to become part of the contemporary art world. "
It is understood that during the period of the biannual exhibition, there will also be a series of lectures, artistic leaders, curators and creative industry leaders will discuss topics such as cross--cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan : coordinating and standardizing the management of public welfare jobs in the countryside – Xinhua News Agency
The Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 12 December 2019 (reporter Lin Bifeng) The Yunnan Province government recently issued a policy to continue to support the employment of poverty- stricken people and to consolidate and expand the achievements of the poverty reduction campaign.
The Yunnan Provincial Bureau of Labour and Social Affairs said that at present, Yunnan has developed 4.483 million public service jobs in rural areas, for the purpose of relocating poverty--stricken labor force, among other things. These jobs have played an important role in helping the poverty--stricken population to achieve employment and income growth, consolidate the achievements of the anti- poverty campaign, and improve the ability of rural areas to provide public services.
This new regulation was jointly issued by the People's Government of Yunnan Province, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Ministry of Science and Technology. It mainly covers the scope of recruitment, the management of funds, the development of job positions and the management of job positions.
In terms of job position development, the new regulation clarifies that the principle of " according to the need to set a job position, according to the job position to hire a person, dynamic management and overall control of the number of job positions" should be followed, as well as the principle of " one person, one job position, voluntary public recruitment and unified management " should be followed.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the announcement, the application, the scrutiny, the public announcement, the hiring, the pre--service training and the deployment..
In addition, the new regulation also specified the specific duties of the departments responsible for the development of public service jobs in rural areas, the standards for the wage subsidies for rural public service jobs, and the way in which the departments responsible for the development of rural public service jobs should purchase accident insurance for rural public service job placement personnel. It also stipulated that the departments responsible for the development of rural public service jobs should periodically monitor the distribution of wage subsidies for rural public service jobs.

Hello.
it is possible to cancel the order.

Although the right wing has had a period of success in history, it has been short--lived, so it is because it gets a little bit of sunshine that it becomes bright and because it drinks a little bit of water, it sweats; if it has a period of success, it will look to Sichuan and suffer a setback.
However, in reality, the right wing played a positive role in the process of social progress..
From the end of the era of the Cultural Revolution, defining the true meaning of truth, the development of the economy, the advancement of science and technology, the promotion of the institutionalization of the government and the protection of human rights, among other aspects,, the right wing's positive meaning should not be denied.
As for me, although I do not agree with some of Lee Wei- Dong's statements, he is a serious person, he is serious about China, he is serious about China's social problems.
However, he opposes his anti-communist ideology, he believes that a necessary revolution will lead to social turmoil, damage to the people's livelihood, and the mingling of political factions. Furthermore, foreigners will take advantage of the chaos to enter the country.
Fourth, to change or improve China, it must have patience and the attitude of being responsible for the country and the people, that is, it must not be a rightist, but a scoundrel.
Talk about it again.
Left, in fact, is a gang of time and political orphans.
If the right has a positive impact on society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right--wing rhetoric and analyse their thoughts from time to time. However, the left does not have this advantage, because what the left wants is exactly the opposite of what the Communist Party has discarded.
Lately, I have seen some of his friends berating the anti-- thieves while denouncing the leftists, and doing so in a very energetic manner. I feel that this is not necessary.
Talking reason with a traitor and a leftist is like talking reason with a piece of string, there is no logic to be found..
Also, they should not try to prove that they are right, and they should not try to make the anti--pirates and leftists admit that they are right.
This is what he told his friends: when the counterfeiters insulted him with five cents, when the leftists insulted him with the right-wingers, it proved that the path in the middle is correct.
Many young people also had ideals when they were young, but when they grew old, they forgot their ideals, or they pursued their ideals, but they became fanatics.
And the ideal and the ideal move farther and farther apart, even to the point where a young dragon becomes an evil dragon..
Left and right, in general, refer to constraints and freedom. China, from its historical and cultural heritage, has a genetic predisposition to be more left--handed than the rest of the world. Therefore, China, as a whole, should be more left--handed than the rest of the world.
However, in China, the right--wing focuses on efficiency and development, while the left- wing focuses on fairness and safety.
In the current society, the overall desire is to pay more attention to fairness. at the same time, China and the United States are at odds with each other, and the leftist tendency is certain. it is likely to continue for many years.
EVen though he does not understand, he will still give a thumbs up.
I don't want to talk about it anymore, Flower Flower is just like that.
In the past two years, the American Empire's blockade and encirclement of Huawei's chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also resulted in huge losses for "American companies".
The United States of America's empire is putting pressure on China's semiconductor industry, demanding that its own businesses and allied countries' businesses simultaneously blockade China's semiconductor industry, which directly led to the result that the supply of semiconductors from all over the world was disrupted, causing the research and development investment and production capacity of semiconductor manufacturing companies to decrease, which in turn led to a shortage of semiconductors in the global supply chain.
The shortage of semiconductors now affects all major industries around the world, including the suspension of production by car manufacturers and the increase in the price of mobile phones. almost all industries that use semiconductors have been affected.
In order to gain " chip " self--sufficiency, more and more of the country's science and technology giants are going down the " de- Americanization " path.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry, the United States has been conducting a series of actions in recent months. The United States has hosted a semiconductor summit, invited 64 countries to form a semiconductor alliance, and provided financial support to American--born technology giants, such as Intel, the United States's oldest technology giant, to regain its leadership in the semiconductor field. For example, the United States's oldest technology giant, Intel, has invested $200 million in Arizona to build two semiconductor fabrication plants. It has also opened up semiconductor manufacturing business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC, and that it might steal TSMC's " dinner plate. "
That's why they are so confident, because Intel, as the United States's oldest technology giant, has been plowing in the field of semiconductors for several decades and has a large number of talented personnel and a large amount of technology reserves, which means that it will be able to quickly rise up and defeat TSMC in a short period of time.
However, in regard to Intel's decision, the founder of TSMC, Zhang Zhiyong, does not take it into consideration.
At the 2021 Great Master Intellectual Forum held in April, Zhang Zhongguo's language was outrageous. Regarding Intel's investment to build a semiconductor fabrication plant, Zhang Zhongguo spoke his mind without reservation: Intel 's investment to build a semiconductor fabrication plant is a slap in the face.
The reason why Zhang Zhongguo is so reluctant to allow Intel to enter the semiconductor wafer sector is because he still holds a grudge against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) and Intel from 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the shining jewel of the American manufacturing industry and was the world's undisputed leader in the field of semiconductors.
In the 1980s, the world's high--end semiconductor chips were in the hands of a small number of strong players.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where the chip was designed, manufactured and tested by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era..
However, this type of business model has made some small businesses unable to bear the burden of heavy production costs, and many semiconductor start-up entrepreneurs, faced with the enormous cost of building a production line, have only been able to look on helplessly.
Driven by market demand, after the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to see the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, after hearing that there was a company that specialized in designing semiconductor chips, Zhang Zhuzhong realized that if there was a company that specialized in manufacturing semiconductor wafers, it would be possible to establish a factory that specialized in manufacturing semiconductor wafers.
Sometime later, Zhang Zhiqing's idea became a reality with the founding of TSMC.
TSMC focuses its main business on " wafer fabrication " this single stage, without design, it only provides wafer fabrication as a subcontracting service.
At that time, the newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) in front of Intel was just a small fry.
In order to gain capital support, Zhang Zhiqing once approached Intel for investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC only manufactures semiconductor chips, had a high opinion of itself and looked down on TSMC, it refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhuoji also believes that Intel at the time looked down on wafer fabrication service.
I didn't expect that the giant of semiconductor wafer manufacturing services would one day also have to start doing semiconductor wafer manufacturing..
Therefore,, Zhang Zhuoguang felt that it was ironic for Intel to enter wafer fabrication outsourcing.
In the meantime, the market value of TSMC has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong offensive, Intel, of course, is not able to stand still.
In the meantime, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) is already pushing for 3-nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14 nm.
It is not easy to overtake.
I've been waiting for this for a long time.
By 19:06, two hours had passed since the first order was placed. 😅
Taking a look at some of today's hottest topics.
what is normal public opinion.
It randomly chooses three of the hottest topics: the two--headed dragon, the rise in the price of good friends and the Pang La La incident, which creates a peak in the spread of public opinion. Then, the index falls ( a smooth curve line ) and eventually dissipates. if there is a second generation of public opinion, there will be a small peak again.
They look the same as the ones shown on the official website of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of
what is the abnormality of public opinion.
Randomly selecting six hot searches from the same incident, they show "isosceles triangle" " serrated " and " cliff " shapes.
The "isolated peak" is the result of man--made heating, and the " sawtooth " is the result of periodic heating, and the " cliff " is the result of collective withdrawal, and the " hot topic " has fulfilled its " function " and has been assigned to a new task and is heading towards a new battlefield.
In event 9, the peak of one event's heat wave coincides exactly with the trough of another event's heat wave, and the time difference is only a matter of seconds, which means that the same batch of water troops received the task and launched a new round of assault.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen clearly: dozens of hot searches at the same time made it to the top of the rankings, some of which attract attention, some of which are responsible for science popularization, some of which generate war propaganda, some of which divert attention, some of which influence perceptions, some of which mislead judgments, some of which incite emotions, some of which influence decision--making, black public relations accounts are divided into batches and divided into stages, almost all of the elements of public opinion dissemination are taken into account.
Propaganda is a science, discarding all subjective factors, only from objective data, even black public relations will have no place to hide..
Everyone who has passed through has left a mark, and this mark has been unearthed by the two of them.
The data comes from the hot search time machine.
Mauritius and other countries have discovered the first case of infection with the Omicron virus strain - Xinhua News Agency
Maldives, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported their first cases of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant on 10 December.
According to the Minister of Health, Kailash Vijayvargiya, one of the infected was a traveller from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27, and the other was a Mauritian citizen who had been in contact with a person who had recently visited South Africa and then returned to Mauritius. Both of them tested positive for HIV on November 30.
After treatment in isolation wards of the hospital, the two infected persons' nucleic acid tests turned out to be negative, and they have since returned to their respective places of residence.
On the 10th day of the month, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Cyprus announced the first confirmation of three cases of the Omicron variant in the country.
All three of them are students, they returned to the country from overseas travel in the beginning of this month and were diagnosed with mild illnesses, so they did not enter the hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Senegalese government has continuously increased the strength of the anti- epidemic effort.
From 6 December 2019 to 10 January 2020, all passengers aged 12 and above entering the country by air were required to undergo a nucleic acid test at the airport after arrival.
The Serbian Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it would begin vaccinating the country's 5 to 11-year old children with the H1N1 vaccine produced by Pirey.
On the 9th of September, Malawi's Health Minister, Kwaneen Chicchom, said that the country had discovered its first three cases of the Omicron strain of the HIV virus.
The country's health department carried out genome sequencing of 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected between November 9 and December 2 and discovered the three cases of infection.

The big beauty 360 integrated house furnishings
Address: No. 156 on Inner City South Road and No. 12 on the 12th floor of Happiness Garden.
At the beginning, a friend introduced him because of trust, so he chose to come to look at it initially his budget was 7 million to do a basic renovation.
When he arrived at the shop, he started a series of fraudulent tricks.
This was his first visit to the shop, he only showed them his floor plan, they did not go to the site to measure the house, but they were able to give him a price of 7 million yuan for a house of 135 square meters. They showed him a rough estimate of their materials, but they did not know what kind of materials they were using.
Their second trick is that if you go to the shop, they will drag him to pay the deposit (and this money is never returned, unless he has enough experience and is able to negotiate with them).
When I was hesitating whether or not to pay the deposit, they invited their so-called manager to tell him that if he paid the deposit today, they would give him a certain amount of discount.
This is a big pit, and I'm just an example of a person who was tricked into paying a deposit of 100,000 yuan in a moment of impulsiveness.
He gave me a price of 7 million, which did not include water and electricity renovations, did not include any doors or kitchen cabinets, and did not include the cost of bathroom renovations, which are the most expensive part of a basic renovation.
In addition to this, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company from the very beginning, nothing was explained clearly and he made me sign a contract..
When I went to get his money back, they acted as if they had a lot of experience, as if they had a special little group of people to deal with him.
whichever way you look at it, the customer is always right is the client's problem and they are completely innocent..
There are a lot of shifting the blame, and a lot of details. I don't want to say all of them, because his friend chose them to do the renovation of his house, and the quality of the work is not good, and there are a lot of fees to be paid afterwards.
Cave--in, they are the original dragon head decoration, now they have been changed to become big and beautiful, just like they have been shut down again and have been changed to become other ones..
Therefore, everyone should not choose such a deceitful construction company.
In the future, when people are choosing, they should go to Baidu to look at these things and check them out because renovation is not a small amount of money.
In order to ask a question to a merchant, one must first register or log in.
It is forbidden to publish all kinds of forms of commercial enterprise ratings,, which is detailed in the commercial enterprise recording declaration.
360 integrated house decoration channel provides the address, telephone, working hours and other latest business information for the mall, so that it is easier for people to find a decoration company to decorate their houses.
This is so scary, if it takes more than 30 minutes, the order should be cancelled.
It seems that there is no other way now, for example, changing the address.
If 5 to 10 days go by and he hasn't paid, I'm going to pursue it.
I asked for 15 minutes not to be cancelled.
The mouth watering chicken should have been cooked, but what was delivered was raw meat. there was no way to eat it.
The starry sky has about 14 days of double star constellation meteor shower - Xinhua News Agency
The New China News Agency, Tianjin, 12 December 2012 ( reporter Zhou Rui Jin ) According to the astronomy popularization expert, the North Hemisphere's third major meteor shower of 2012, the Gemini meteor shower, will peak on 14 December. Meteor enthusiasts can observe the meteor shower after midnight on 14 December.
In 2018, Beijing city amateur astronomer An Kun photographed a meteor shower in the constellation of Gemini on December 13 in the province of Qinghai.
The vast majority of the parent bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Double- Nugget meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apophis- type asteroid.
The Taurus meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not caused by a comet.
The Tianjin Astronomical Society vice president and astronomy popularization expert Zhao Liangping said that just like the meteor shower at the end of the year, the meteor shower in the constellation of Gemini usually appears around the end of the year, and the " screening period " can last from December 4 to December 17.
This flow of meteors is characterized by its large flow rate and stability, along with the flow of meteors from the constellation of Coma Berenices and the English constellation of Ursa Major, which are collectively known as the three major flow of meteors in the Northern Hemisphere.
One of the distinctive features of the Taurid meteor shower is the relatively slow speed of the meteoroids, their rich colors, and the presence of fireballs. This shower is suitable for both amateur astronomy and amateur astronomy photography.
Tianjin city amateur astronomer Yang Geng on December 13, 2020 photographed the meteor shower of the Gemini constellation in Tianjin county.
The meteorological forecast shows that the meteor shower of the Gemini constellation will peak at 12:15 p.m. on December 14, with a maximum hourly rate of 150 meteors per hour.
a flow of meteors from the constellation of Gemini.
Last year' s " Pleiades meteor shower " left a deep impression on people, but this year ' s " Pleiades meteor shower " will be affected by the moon ' s light interference, which will reduce the intensity of the shower.
On the 14th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, the lunar month is in surplus, the moon is bright and the moonlight will interfere with observations. However, by the end of the night, the moon will set and the flow of meteorites in the constellation of Gemini will rise.
Friends who like to watch shooting stars can observe them in the last half of the night after the moon has set, but they should take care to protect themselves from the cold and keep warm. "
How to be able to observe as many shooting stars as possible.
"It is not advisable to carry out observations in the city, but it is possible to do so in the outskirts or in the countryside, by choosing a high- altitude site with a small amount of light pollution, facing east-northeast, and waiting patiently for the moon to set, after which a visual observation can be carried out.
It is important to note that the flow rate of the double star stream is very high in all directions, so it is not necessary to constantly watch the double star stream's radiation point during observation.
Friends of photography who like to take pictures should try to take pictures with a large field of view and a large aperture lens. They should use high ISO and maximum aperture while taking pictures.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, the three-- legged tripod, the standby battery and the fast shutter cable are also indispensable. "
Mr. Zhu said.
The difference between laser television and traditional television in terms of market positioning.
According to the author's understanding, the term "traditional television" refers to the liquid crystal television, while the difference in the market positioning between the laser television and the liquid crystal television is mainly due to the following two points.
The first is that the laser television is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the all--encompassing market positioning of the liquid crystal television, the laser television is clearly more focused on the large screen market, or the laser television itself is a product of the large screen market.
At present, the mainstream size of liquid crystal televisions is between 55 and 65 inches, while the size of laser televisions is generally between 75 and 100 inches, and some even exceed 100 inches, fully meeting the demand of users for large screen color televisions..
In recent years, the outgoing volume and sales volume of laser TVs worldwide have increased continuously and now account for more than 60 percent of the total television sales volume in the 80-inch and above category.
According to a forecast by the company, the sales volume of laser TVs in 2020 would increase by more than 140 percent, continuing to maintain a high rate of growth.
The reason for its success in the large screen market is due to its outstanding performance in the field of protecting the eyes.
Based on the principle of the mirage, the light from the laser light source does not directly hit the eyeball, as opposed to the backlight source of the liquid crystal television. The process of the formation of the image is more similar to the natural conditions of the formation of the image of the object, and the irritation to the eye is also smaller.
The China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute's Sai Xi laboratory and the Beijing Dongzhong Hospital's Ophthalmology Department conducted a strict comparison test between a laser television and a liquid crystal television under the same conditions on a group of people. 144 sets of test data were obtained.
The data proves that the laser television has a very strong protective eye feature, in some respects even having a certain improvement effect.
With the increasing awareness of eye health in today's society, laser TVs, which have the advantage of protecting the eyes, have attracted more and more users, and have also opened up a new market for color television.
The second is that the laser television is more focused on the high--end market.
Unlike the price of liquid crystal televisions, the price of mega- laser televisions is constantly going down. Currently, the price of mega- laser televisions sold in the market is mostly more than RMB 100,000, but as the size and light source are upgraded, the price is gradually going up.
The reason why the price of laser television is so high is because of the laser.
There must be something to it..
With the development of light source and technology, the mega laser television has many advantages over liquid crystal television and projection television that cannot be achieved.
thanks to the super short projection distance of the laser television, the projection distance of the laser television is relatively short compared to traditional projection equipment, it can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance of 100 inches, and the space required is small, and the main machine is small and compact, it takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach 2000 lumens or more.
In addition, the heat output is lower, resulting in less wear and tear on the equipment, resulting in a longer lifespan of the television.
In addition to this, many high--end laser television sets have also been equipped with true 4K ultra high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, biomimetic screens, and other cutting-edge technologies, which will give viewers a more powerful visual and auditory experience.
It's not a fake demand, but rather a demand for a product that is subdivided by the quality of the picture and the ratio of output to input. the laser television does not appeal to film and television enthusiasts because it does not meet the requirements of a large screen and a viewing environment. It is possible to try it out, but there are advantages and disadvantages, and one must judge for oneself after weighing the pros and cons. one should not be swayed by one--sided opinions.
In simple terms, the ultra- wide- angle near focus laser television projector - the laser television projector that uses the most expensive ultra- wide- angle lens and reflector lens, which does not conform to the best optical design.
In order to filter out some of the ambient light, a micro-structured phospholipid screen was used, at a high cost, the price of 80 inches was basically able to replace a 65 inch liquid crystal screen..
And there is one more thing that I particularly dislike about the projection equipment manufacturer's use of the mirage effect as a selling point: the light rays that reach the eye from the screen are the same as the light rays that reach the eye from the ceiling. The light rays that reach the eye from the screen are the same as the light rays that reach the eye from the ceiling. The light rays that reach the eye from the screen are the same as the light rays that reach the eye from the ceiling. The light rays that reach the eye from the screen are the same as the light rays that reach the eye from the ceiling. The light rays that reach the eye from the screen are the same as the light rays that reach the eye from the ceiling. The light rays that reach the eye from the screen are the same as the light rays that reach the eye from the ceiling. The light rays that reach the eye from the screen are the same as the light rays that reach the eye from the ceiling. The light rays that reach the eye from the screen are the same as the light rays that reach the eye from the ceiling.
More importantly, a projection screen without a matt finish will not produce an image..
The high gain screen's hot spot ( light spot ) effect was overlooked, at a certain angle, a large amount of light is reflected to the eye, which is really uncomfortable.
The visual aesthetics of photography museum, the best quality store, temporarily does not have a branch.
She added a pre--reservation date to her WeChat, and then sent the available time slots to me. the response time was quicker than usual.
Previously, he went to the studio to look at the wedding photos shot there, more of which were outdoor wedding photos, shot in a very beautiful way. The shooting style of the wedding photos was also very diverse.
On the same day, he arrived and had a brief conversation with the little lady about his ideas. he was very patient in helping her try on two sets of clothes that she was unsure about, and eventually decided to start the makeup, hairstyling and photography. Before the shoot, the photographer would set up some props, give instructions, and pay attention to many details.
However, it is possible that because he did not communicate his specific filming ideas with me, he ended up filming something that was not what he wanted,, but that was still good to look at. 🙊 🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help choose the photos, discuss the post--production style, the photographer was quite attentive..
The finished film takes about half a month to be ready, waiting for the effect.
The second time he hit the photo shoot class of the tyrannical lunch - most of the clothes in the room could choose one piece of clothing to be photographed..
In the end, she chose a black chiffon dress, to experience different styles.
The entire filming process took about two hours, including makeup and filming, the filming director was a 95er who was the nephew of a photographer. He was a little bit shy, but he gave good advice when it came to posing. The filming process was a lot of fun.

It is now on the first page, so it is time to see Queenie as well..
He first filled in his name, telephone number, then chose the type of clothing and the wedding dress. He changed three or four sets of clothing, but he was very patient. After choosing, he did his makeup for a long time, and the service attitude was also good. After that, the photographer taught him how to pose and how to pose. The result was that the face looked big, the photographer said it would take half a month, but it only took three or four days to get the photos. He felt that the photos did not differ much from the original film.
The overall situation is still good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are three possible positions for make--up: in the middle of the room, in front of the photographer's studio, and in front of the photographer's studio in the middle of the room.
They are very enthusiastic and also very attentive.
The hairstylist was very patient..
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching him the movements.
If the photographer is not satisfied, he will ask for a retake.
【 experience ] the makeover may have gone a bit too far, the original double eyelid was plastered with three eyelids..
The eyebrows were also shaved, for those who do not paint their eyebrows on a daily basis, it is a bit awkward.
The photos were sent to him about ten days ago, but the photo effect was not satisfactory, he felt that the double eyelid surgery was still very obvious.
Because he wasn't sure what kind of style he wanted, he tried on two sets. He went back and forth until he finally settled on a black suit. The lady said that this set was more in line with the old--fashioned retro style.
After choosing the clothes, the makeup and hair styling started. The makeup artist and the hairstylist were very patient in helping her to do the makeup and hair styling. The result was very satisfactory.
After the make-up was done, the photographer started taking pictures. the photographer guided her to pose in different positions throughout the shoot. It was a very relaxed and harmonious process.
After the shoot, he carefully selected four photos that he liked the most for the post--production. he said that the film was 15 minutes long and that he was very satisfied with the ending.
Already three days have passed without a response. because their system is unable to recognise his credit card, he is unable to join the #PRS - Org # plus monthly fee scheme.
The most bizarre thing is that he uses the same credit card every time he makes a payment.
I have to pay the transportation fee every time.
They can first exempt him from paying his monthly rent, until they have finished their investigation, and then collect his monthly rent afterwards., he said.
A small umbrella to buy insurance is not a good idea.
A small rain umbrella is an internet- based insurance agent recruitment platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions,, according to the 2015 amendment of the regulation on the supervision of insurance agency companies,, it is necessary to meet three key words in order to become an insurance agency company: the shareholders, the founders must have no major violations of the law in the past three years, and the minimum amount of capital must be 500 million yuan. In addition, the approval of the Ministry of Public Security must be obtained.
These three clauses are in fact very strict, when summarized, they mean that the company must have real power, that it must have been approved by the Ministry of Public Security, that the company's shareholders must have a good reputation, and that as an insurance agency, the company must have the approval of the Ministry of Public Security, that the company's shareholders must have a good reputation, and that as an insurance agency, the company must have the approval of the Ministry of Public Security, that the company's shareholders must have a good reputation, and that as an insurance agency, the company must have the approval of the Ministry of Public Security, that the company's shareholders must have a good reputation, and that as an insurance agency, the company must have the approval of the Ministry of Public Security, that the company's shareholders must have a good reputation, and that as an insurance agency, the company must have the approval of the Ministry of Public Security, that the company's shareholders must have a good reputation, and that as an insurance agency, the company must have the approval of the Ministry
In this respect, it is not bad, it is worth trusting.
From the point of view of the insurance product, the small rain umbrella insurance is a supermarket for insurance products. Many companies' star disability insurance products are sold at this platform,, such as the recently launched and Tay Super 5 disability insurance by Tay People's Life Insurance. Small rain umbrella insurance is only a third party intermediary, so there is no reason to doubt its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment model,, the Internet platform's product, because of the lack of the cost of the operation of the retail outlets and the salary of the businessmen, so that the Internet platform's product has a high cost--benifit ratio, and the payment method is flexible, it allows for monthly payments, reducing the pressure on the people to pay for the insurance. At the same time, the Internet platform's product can maximize the use of the leverage of the insurance.
This point is still very good..
it can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the business staff, this point is particularly important, because the insurance industry is an industry that requires a very high level of professionalism. As a result, many Internet-based products can be self--insured by the customer, which means that there are a lot of misconceptions in the area of health declaration and vocation. In the area of health declaration and vocation, non- insurance professionals tend to think that they are healthy or fit for the job, which means that there is a high risk of being denied compensation.
I used to work as a telephone salesman for "Tengteng micro-protection" (and the little umbrella is the same, it is an internet- based insurance agency) and he was very responsible in telling people about the importance of insurance.
The Internet's insurance is genuine and trustworthy, but people are not. The Internet's channel does not have any professional from the industry, and it also has a lot of salespeople who mislead.
For example, 1 yuan of insurance protects 60 million, buy insurance and get a mobile phone for free, receive 6 million yuan of redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable re
The insurance company will pay 600 million yen (US$6.0 million) to compensate for the damage. (US$600,000,000).
Free of charge sent mobile phone, is the tail number of the insurance certificate, for example, 6666, 8888, these special segments of the insurance certificate number are sent free of charge, and if the winning short message is sent out, the owner does not exchange it, and no one has reminded him.
(for the person who applies for protection, this is another pitfall ) free to receive 6 million ringgit in redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable
Currently, the government is cracking down on the misleading advertisements for Internet insurance sales.
So, when viewed as a whole, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the lack of professionalism and professional ethics on the part of the businessmen..
It is suggested that the subject of the essay should take a careful look at the matter, in fact, many line- down insurance agency companies' products are more comprehensive and the customers can choose from a wider range of opportunities and products, and some of the products have a better cost- benefit ratio than the Internet products.
He himself has assisted 59 Internet customers in securing line--down products, saving 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per person per year.
If anyone has any doubts, they are welcome to talk to him and exchange views.
Mingyu, an insurance agent, has three years of experience in business management training, has served nearly 1,000 businesses, has cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, and before signing a contract, he will design a customized insurance product for the customer based on the customer's needs. During the signing of the contract, he will compare three insurance companies to get the best result for the customer. After signing the contract, he will organize the customer's insurance certificates, take care of them, and make the customer feel at ease.
to accompany each customer in their lifelong development.
I hope that the answer given by the author will help the original questioner.
According to the definition of the insurance supervisory department,, the Internet insurance is the insurance business in which the person who clicks on the insurance link can complete all the insurance procedures on his own.
In this process, the mover does not need to sign his name and the insurance advisor does not need to sign his name. All steps can be completed by the mover alone.
Although the online insurance contract does not have much " ritualistic " feeling, it may even not have a printed paper version of the contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is similar to that of "telephone sales" in that it is a production line operation, but it also has a fatal flaw in that it may not be able to provide adequate after--sales service.
Insurance is usually a long--term contract that lasts for several decades, and when one buys insurance, he or she should seriously think about choosing a "protector" that can accompany him or her for a long period of time, and also provide services to him or her in many years to come.

It is enough to redeem the discount code.
There is no problem, he remembers that he has already bought another one and does not want to waste it.
Thank you for helping him.
From the past to the present, he has always opposed any form of defamation and slander, and has not been able to tolerate this type of attack on his person.
In a civilized society, they can tolerate everything, but they will not tolerate this kind of scoundrel..
If we don't take into account political parties and factional groups, the first thing that needs to be resisted is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From the moment he started sending Facebook friend requests, then posting provocative messages, and then trying to reveal her home address and her father's name on social media, she has adopted a non-- responsive attitude.
Latterly, he has become more and more intense in his tagging of me, not only on a daily basis, six times a day,, but also on Facebook, with his so--called friends continuing to discuss about him in a veiled and humiliating manner, such as his appearance, figure, lifestyle, whether or not to have sex, and so on. I have had enough..
Latterly,, however, more of his friends began to send him pictures of his Facebook friend's page with a picture of him and sexually suggestive language.
As a woman, I can no longer remain silent..
When the news of his arrest was reported, he did not calm down at all, on the contrary, he became even more aggressive.
I don't care who he is or what his political background is, I don't care what his social status is, in our society, respect for both sexes is needed.
Yes, they can continue with this kind of rhetoric, which is full of double meanings, innuendos, humiliation and insults, they can continue to say that they only care about and are interested in me, they can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and they can even continue to deny that this is their own creation.
There's no way I can stop them, and I don't have the power to stop them.
I don't know him, and he doesn't want to know him, and his appearance and physique do not require him to be judged.
I don't even think that there is a single female student who would be willing to allow herself to be humiliated in such a way in order to gain fame..
A friend asked him how he was doing.
I say yes, he won't either..
I don't think there is a single female student who would have been subjected to such harassment and still be able to say that she was doing well..
Whether in the workplace, in society, in the political arena or in the business world, only those who do not even have the basic sense of decency will choose to use this method to hurt any woman.
I believe that public opinion is in the hearts of the people.
I translated part of the comments for the public to judge.
His own post should have no one who can pretend to be him now.
I can only say that he is the public enemy of civilization.
a hearty laugh.
Vietnam People's Newspaper - Vietnam Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Minh attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
During the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held on the themes of digital technology enterprises and national digitalization transformation, digital technology enterprises and the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic and post- epidemic economic recovery and development.
The Minister of Information and Communications, Nguyen Xuan Thang, said that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, the number of digital technology companies in Vietnam and their revenues continued to increase by nearly 10 percent.

Secretary of the Ministry of Information and Communications, Nguyen Búi Thieu called on digital technology enterprises to take responsibility for the development of the country's digitalization turnover platform. The task of developing the country's digital turnover platform is to fulfill the country's mission.
At the forum, the leaders of the various departments and government agencies discussed the research, development, application, and transfer of digital technology among businesses, organizations, and individuals, and shared their efforts to mobilize and gather all of society's resources to develop Vietnam's technology companies, work together to push the country's digitalization transition, and come up with breakthrough ideas and solutions to deal with the aftermath of the AIDS epidemic, the post--war economic recovery, and other issues.

The digital transformation needs to participate in the preservation and propagation of the country's cultural values, its historical traditions, its national folk culture and so on, as well as the establishment of a database for these areas. It also needs to push forward the digital transformation of the banking, taxation, land management and development sectors, as well as the transportation sector.
The most important goal of the digital transformation is to make the people happier and to make the country more prosperous.
Prime Minister Fang Xinjian demanded that all levels of government, all levels of government agencies and enterprises involved in the development of digital technology should increase their leadership and supervisory capacity, raise their awareness of the need for a digital transformation, continue to draft and complete regulations on digital transformation, strengthen national management, and push forward the development of digital technology enterprises in a spirit of respecting each other, communicating, listening and being proactive and active.
During the forum, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Minh attended the 2021 "Viet Nam Made" Excellent Digital Products Award ceremony and the " Viet Nam Made " Digital Products Exhibition opening ceremony.

The establishment of the water-borne green comprehensive service area is another milestone in the construction of the green navigation of the Yangtze River. the ability of the Yangtze River ship to receive and dispose of pollutants and to provide navigation services has been significantly enhanced.
According to the introduction, the water- based green comprehensive service area is for the benefit of the large number of ships and sailors to provide all--round production and living services and to help the sailors to solve their " urgent, difficult, worry and longing " problems.
This time, the two inland waterways in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have been completed and put into operation, which are a combination of living, production, and government services, with the theme of environmental protection, specialized in ship maintenance and emergency rescue services, and which allow ships to dock once and offer multiple services, which will make the work of the ship's crew more efficient and their lives more convenient.

Talking to a friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock value and the loss of 2.51 billion dollars in market value, Zuckerberg responded " facing unprecedented competition. "
Meta (formerly Facebook) is a company that is primarily an advertising company, which earns most of its income from advertising. Today, advertising companies that have their own flow channels are making money.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and others, regardless of the type of function they have,, are Meta's flow of traffic channel.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest " advertising alliance ", with many apps outsourcing their advertising to Meta's advertising platform, through which they can earn money.
However, the times have changed.
Firstly, due to the change in the privacy policy of Apple, Meta is no longer able to obtain user data, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
The current privacy policy of Apple is very friendly to the user and clearly indicates to the user whether or not the app is allowed to obtain information about him or her. Most people's normal reaction is to not allow the app to obtain information about him or her.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth also weakened (the proportion of this factor is not known with certainty, but it does exist).
In everyday life, everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not correct..
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing business overseas.
Meta's office in Hong Kong has about 300 people, in mainland China there are several large agents.
Chinese companies want to expand their markets overseas, Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel, most of the money is given to Meta..
Interestingly, TT nowadays is one of Meta's main competitors, but two years ago, Meta made a lot of money from TT.
All the local agents are helping Zenith go to Meta to advertise, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region is also very good.
Recently, he has not specifically studied it, but it is certain that it will not be as good as before.
The time when Chinese companies were burning a lot of money in overseas markets has already passed..
The third is that the expansion of the new flow channel has not gone smoothly.
Facebook has become increasingly old, new platforms such as TT are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in current income, but also in future prospects.
It is obvious that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zack Braff talked about " the metaverse ".
The concept of the " metaverse " is certainly one of the future directions, but the implementation period of the " metaverse " is quite long, and the story of the " metaverse " in these two or three years is not enough to support the market value of Meta.
Therefore, in the next two years, it should be a difficult period for Meta.
Despite the fact that Facebook is now making a lot of money and has an annual income of 1 billion to 2 billion dollars, the company is actually in a lot of trouble. Compared to other internet companies and high--tech companies, it does not have a good safety barrier.
Although his several social networking software have a relatively high number of daily users, they are the mainstream of social networking software, such as Facebook, Whatsapp, etc., but in the face of TikTok's rapid development, Facebook has no confidence and is being overthrown by it. they are just a blink of an eye..
However, the idea of creating a virtual world, the so-called " metaverse " is a concept that is impossible to achieve in the short term, and therefore has no chance of success. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg has changed the name of his company and is constantly searching for a new race track. However, his choice of race track is wrong, it is a road that leads nowhere. This is my own thoughts, for reference.
