At the Zhejiang University Academic Year Conference, students sang the main role in presenting research results that made people's brains open wide - Xinhua News Agency.
Using air to wash one's hands, pronouncing a disease based on the sound of one's throat, searching for the source of the fog and smog, yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of scientific achievements were awarded.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, the research areas include the environment, mechanical engineering, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities education, and many other major fields. The students started from a point of curiosity and created many high--end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards both in China and internationally.
Biological sensors : his home doctor.
A team of biomedical engineering doctoral students led by Zhang Tingming demonstrated a smartphone- sized biological sensing device on the spot.
"All he needs to do is to blow a small amount of air into the device, and it can detect the composition of the air he exhales and make a preliminary assessment of his health condition.. "
Zhang Tingming said that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and when it detects gas, a health report will be displayed on the smartphone.
On the market, there is a smart ring that is able to detect the wearer's health status, which usually measures temperature, pulse and other physical parameters..
This set of biological sensors uses a new type of material, graphene. Its target substance is chemical elements, and its keen sense of smell allows it to more deeply and accurately detect the state of a person's health.
Smart surgical light : the doctor's high energy eyes.
Besides the smartphone, the surgical room also used the smart surgical light..
This invention won a silver award at the 44th International Geneva Inventions Exhibition in 2018.
The graduate student of the Department of Optoelectronic Sciences and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Zhu Yu Lin and Shen Jun Feng team opened a new path in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented the smart LED surgical no-- shadow lamp.
"A lot of early- stage disease detection and cutting out is not done properly, this is related to the light used in the surgery room. "
According to Shen Junfeng,, for example, when cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, if the doctor is not able to see all of the cancerous tissue, then the cancerous cells will continue to spread..
This type of smart surgical light has four light discs, which can adjust the light spectrum to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light illumination.
During surgery, the surgeon can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness of the light, the light spectrum, the uniformity of the color, and the lack of shadows according to the needs of the surgery and his own habits.
This type of smart surgical light has already been used in the affiliated hospitals of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine's affiliated Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine's affiliated Huashan Hospital, among other hospitals, and received positive feedback.
Last year in October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Using air to wash their hands: saving water and cool at the same time.
ordinary people wash their hands by simply splashing water on them, perhaps rubbing some soap on their hands, or squeezing some hand sanitizer,, while Liu Bicheng and his peers have invented a " hand-washing device that uses air " ã€‚
Just by standing on the wash basin of the equipment, their body weight would compress the air and force it out.
"it's like a blow- up balloon.
The compressed air, at the water faucet, forms a stream of liquid, which merges with the water.
This way, we can wash their hands clean. "
This method of hand washing has been proven to have the same effectiveness as the conventional method of hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on its own gravitational force as a driving force, while still ensuring cleanliness, it also saves 90% of water. The entire process is completely energy- efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second global summit on major challenges, this invention emerged from among the world's top universities and was awarded the only gold medal..
He should send it back to me as soon as possible, thanks.
cancel the order and return the money, without points, and not to use PRS Organization in the future.
Bones and spicy pickled cabbage are not suitable for small friends to eat.
If so, it should be ordered as soon as possible.
There are none at the moment, thank God.
He told me to tell them where he was #PRS Org #
I didn't want to wait, cancelled the order.
I#PRS Org# bought it, but he wrote the wrong address.
it can be changed.
or cancel the order.
It's good, it's a pain in the neck.
A very meaningful certificate - the first aid certificate.
This is the only one of his certificates, apart from his driving license, that he considers important.
In a nutshell, emergency first aid measures are actually emergency first aid measures to be carried out in the event of an emergency, i.e. before the arrival of the ambulance.
Everyone knows that in the process of the ambulance arriving at the scene of the accident, there is still a period of time,, and it is this period of time that is the most crucial..
This is the time when urgent help is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a stroke, a cerebral haemorrhage and stopped breathing, his life's window was only four minutes and four seconds, the golden four minutes and four seconds.
So it is very important for people around me to know how to give first aid..
When someone collapses in front of them, they can use their professional knowledge to try to revive him, rather than standing there helplessly and doing nothing, which is too frightening.
"In China, official data shows that every year there are three million people who die unexpectedly, the most dangerous of which is heart failure..
In the United States, the national average is 15 percent.
In the Las Vegas gambling hotel, 78 percent of those rescued could be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing were below one percent. "
This was the first reaction of the founder of the first reaction, Liu Lei.
If a person's heart stops beating, their breathing stops, their heart stops beating, chest compressions are of no use.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compressions in order to bring the person back to life..
I find that there are still very few people who have this kind of awareness to learn emergency first aid, but when a situation arises, they are not able to react in time. Therefore, it is still necessary to urge everyone to learn a little bit of this skill so that they can react immediately in the event of an emergency.
It may still be able to save one person's life.
First Aid certificates can be obtained at their local Red Cross training centers by registering at the Red Cross training center in Pusan. Students are also eligible for discounts.
PS: the last picture is a record of his own 25-year-old goal, to add the emergency first aid certificate to his list of goals, which was done a few months ago, but he did complete it anyway..
After that, he had to go to take other certificates he wanted to take, he planned to take a scuba diving certificate, which he saw on a small red book before,. It turns out that in order to be able to take a scuba diving certificate, he had to have a scuba diving emergency certificate. Therefore, the scuba diving emergency certificate is still very useful.
He ordered # # Number #.
The 13 rupee prawn dumpling is one of them..
I haven't tried it.
I don't know why #Name # doesn't write clearly.
One costs 13 euros.
Yesterday, the PRS Organization sent the wrong meal, this time it was just one shrimp dumpling for me to eat..
because the previous time when he entered the code, he saw that it was effective.
To start with the conclusion, in my opinion, the movie " Four Seas " is a bad movie from all aspects.
However, the film itself is not a shining point either, and the choice of music is not as good as it could have been.
There are many types of bad films. falling asleep in a cinema hall while watching a film is one type, watching a film to the end and being angered by it is another type. the film " Four Seas " is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, it can ignite the audience's anger in many different ways.
When it comes to insulting the audience, no one is as talented as Tran Hong Nguyen.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creature from the world of CK's novels, hard to name, with many holes in it, just like the windcoat on the body of Little Mama.
Even after watching it, one may doubt whether the director had a hidden metaphor in mind, but when one thinks about it carefully, it turns out to be just a load of bullshit..
First of all, it is very difficult to understand some of the plot points.
The male protagonist lives in a small island in the south, with his grandmother as his caretaker.
Her grandmother has a wish is to see snow, and then the storyline arranges a neighbor to take her to the northeast to see snow.
An elderly person sits in a bread truck from the south to the northeast to see snow.
He and his father are still very relaxed about this.
Then this old man just disappeared..
opening a bar on a derelict ship with a female main character and her brother getting a liquor license.
The mountain road was transformed into a closed road because of the actions of a small gang of hoodlums on the island.
The cement truck then stopped in the middle of the road and the cement truck driver couldn't find any of the cement truck drivers around.
This sense of theatricality is too obvious now.
A small--fry criminal with a bad reputation and a history of violating the law who becomes a deputy police officer for some reason.
In the face of high--interest loans, why they did not report to the police, in the film, the police officer specifically asked whether there was a difficult situation.
A grown-up person knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to use a room card to open the door of a dormitory, and then forcefully arranges to find the owner of the dormitory and sleeps outside the room door for a night..
This kind of nonsensical storyline pervades the entire film, because the storyline is so nonsensical that, when he remembers it, he feels pained by it.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about the film is its main theme,, or rather, the fact that this film has no main theme at all, and is nothing but a grotesque monstrosity.
At the beginning of the film, it seems that he wanted to make a comedy film, 20 minutes later, it seems that it could also be a motivational film. Halfway through the film, it seems that it could be a drama depicting the struggles of small--town youth. After watching the film, it's hard to say whether it was a comedy, a motivational film or a drama depicting the struggles of small--town youth. This is followed by a deep sense of self--doubt.
For the most part, most people are already very familiar with the formula of most films, for example, a film about a motorcycle racer would be about an underdog who overcomes adversity to achieve success.
If he wants to make a romantic film, he will tell the story of a young man from a small town who falls in love with a waitress.
If he wants to depict the real world, the least he can do is to make sure that his story does not contain things that are out of place with the normal world.
(e.g. the character played by Ajit Vadakayil, the new motorbike that was burnt, but still able to sing,) cannot go to open some of the holes in the brain that Kennedy looked at.
As for the female lead, she is not a weak- minded person, but in some ways she behaves like a 5- year old child, and I don't know whether it is due to her acting skills or the director's request.
There is also one thing that I don't quite understand about him, as a race car driver,, why he is so passionate about adding crash scenes to his own films..
The film's release during the Spring Festival holidays is a clear indication that the filmmakers are trying to give audiences a hard time.
