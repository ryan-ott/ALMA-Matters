whether there is a way to punish him.
to prevent it from happening again.

At the academic year conference of Zhejiang University, students sang the main role in presenting research results that made people's brains open wide - Xinhua News Agency.
Using air to wash one's hands, using one's mouth to diagnose a disease, and accurately searching for the source of smog and fog, were among the achievements awarded at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year Conference of the Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these achievements were all students, the research covered a wide range of fields, including the environment, mechanical engineering, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities education, and so on. Students started from a simple curiosity and created many high--end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards in China and internationally.
Biological sensors : his home doctor.
A team of biomedical engineering doctoral students led by Zhang Tingming demonstrated a smartphone- sized biological sensing device on the spot.
"All he needs to do is blow lightly into the device, and it can detect the composition of the air he exhales and give a preliminary assessment of his health condition.. "
Zhang Tingming said that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and when it detects gas, a health report will be displayed on the smartphone.
On the market, there is a smart ring that is able to detect the wearer's health status. it usually measures temperature, pulse and other physical parameters..
This set of biological sensors uses a new type of material, graphene, and its target substance is chemical elements. its keen sense of smell allows it to more deeply and accurately detect the state of a person's health.
Smart surgical light : the doctor's high energy eyes.
Besides the smartphone, the surgical room also used the smart surgical light..
This invention won a silver award at the 44th International Geneva Inventions Exhibition in 2018.
The graduate student of the Department of Optoelectronic Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Zhu Yu Lin and Shen Jun Feng team opened a new path in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented the smart LED surgical no-- shadow lamp.
"A lot of early- stage disease detection and cutting out is not done in the right place, and this is related to the light used in the surgery room. "
According to Shen Junfeng,, for example, when cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, if the doctor is not able to see all of the cancerous tissue, then the cancerous cells will continue to spread..
This type of smart surgical light has four light disks, which can adjust the light spectrum to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light illumination.
During surgery, the surgeon can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness of the light, the light spectrum, the uniformity of the color, and the lack of shadows according to the needs of the surgery and his own habits.
This type of smart surgical light has already been used in the affiliated hospitals of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine's affiliated Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine's affiliated Huashan Hospital, among other hospitals, and received positive feedback.
Last year in October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Using air to wash their hands: saving water and cool at the same time.
ordinary people just wash their hands with water and rub some soap on top, at the most, they apply some hand sanitizer. On the other hand, Li Bicheng and his peers have invented a " hand washing device that uses air " .
Just by standing on the hand washing station, the weight of their bodies would compress the air and force it out.
"It's like a blow- up balloon.
The compressed air, at the water faucet, forms a stream of liquid, which merges with the water.
This way, we can wash their hands clean. "
This method of hand washing has been proven to be as effective as hand washing with soap and water, and as effective as hand washing with soap and water.
This device only needs to rely on its own gravitational force as a driving force, which ensures cleanliness and also saves 90% of water. The entire process is completely energy- saving and environmentally friendly..
Last year, at the second global summit on major challenges, this invention stood out among the world's top universities and was awarded the only gold medal..
He should send it back to me as soon as possible, thanks.
Cancel the order and return the money, without points, and not to use PRS Organization in the future.
there is no bone and spicy pickled cabbage is not suitable for small friends to eat.
If it is,, it should be ordered as soon as possible.
There are none at the moment, thank God.
He told me to tell them where he was #PRS Org #
I didn't want to wait, cancelled the order.
I#PRS Org# bought it, but he wrote the wrong address.
it can be changed.
or cancel the order.
That's good, I'm sorry to have bothered him.
A very meaningful certificate - the emergency first aid certificate.
This is the only one of his certificates, apart from his driving license, that he considers important.
To make it clear, the emergency measures are actually the emergency measures to be taken in the event of an emergency, i.e. the emergency measures to be taken before the arrival of the ambulance.
Everyone knows that in the process of the ambulance arriving at the scene of the accident, there is still a period of time,, and it is this period of time that is the most crucial..
This is the time when urgent help is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a stroke, a cerebral hemorrhage, a cardiac arrest, his life's window was only four minutes and four seconds, the golden four minutes and four seconds.
So it is very important for the people around me to know how to give first aid..
When someone collapses in front of them, they can use their professional knowledge to try to revive him, rather than standing there in a state of helplessness, unable to do anything,, this feeling of helplessness is too scary.
"In China, official data shows that every year there are three million people who die unexpectedly, the most dangerous of which is heart failure..
In the United States, the national average is 15% that can be rescued.
In the Las Vegas gambling hotel, 78 percent of those rescued could be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing were below 1 percent. "
This was the first reaction of the founder of the first reaction, Liu Lei.
If a person's heart stops beating, their breathing stops and their heart stops beating, chest compressions are of no use.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compressions in order to have a chance of bringing the person back to life..
I find that there are still very few people who have this kind of awareness to study emergency first aid, but when a situation arises, they are unable to react in time. Therefore, it is still necessary to call on everyone to learn a little bit of this skill, so that they are able to react immediately in the event of an emergency.
It may still be able to save one person's life.
First Aid certificates can be obtained at their local Red Cross training centers by registering at the Red Cross training center in Pusan. Students are also entitled to discounts.
PS: the last picture is a record of himself 25 years ago, when he wanted to complete his goal of obtaining a first aid certificate, which was also a matter of a few months ago, but he actually managed to complete it..
After that, he wants to go for other certificates he wants to get, he plans to go for a diving certificate, he saw on a small red book that there is also a diving emergency certificate that he wants to get. Apparently, to be able to get the diving emergency certificate, he needs to have the diving certificate first. Therefore, the diving emergency certificate is still very useful.
He ordered # number #.
The 13 rupee prawn dumpling is one of them..
I've never tried it.
I don't know why # Name # does not write clearly.
one costs 13 euros.
Yesterday, # PRS Organization # sent the wrong meal, this time only one shrimp dumpling was given to me to eat..
because the previous time when he entered the code, he saw that it was effective.
To start with the conclusion, in my opinion, the movie " Four Seas " is a bad movie from all aspects.
However, the film itself is not a shining point either, and the choice of music is not as good as it could have been.
There are many kinds of bad films, falling asleep in a movie theater is one of them, watching a film to the end and being filled with disgust is another. " Four Seas " is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can use many different ways to ignite the viewer's anger.
When it comes to insulting the audience, no one is as talented as Tran Hong Nhieu.
The most painful part of this film is that it seems to be a creation of the CK universe, a creature that is hard to name and has many holes in it, just like the windcoat on the body of Little Mama.
Even after watching it, you will doubt whether the director was actually hinting at a hidden meaning, but when one thinks about it carefully, it turns out that it is actually just a load of bullshit..
First of all, it is very difficult to understand some of the plot twists.
The male protagonist lives in a small island in the south, with his grandmother.
Her grandmother has a wish to see snow, and then the storyline arranges for a neighbor to drive her to the northeast to see snow.
An elderly person riding a bread cart travels from the south to the northeast to see the snow.
He and his father are still very relaxed about this.
Then this old man just disappeared..
opening a bar on a derelict ship, how the female protagonist's brother managed to get a liquor license.
The mountain road has become a closed road thanks to the efforts of a small gang of hoodlums on the island..
The cement trucks then stopped in the middle of the road and the cement truck drivers were unable to find a place to park their trucks.
The feeling of the object is too obvious now.
A small--time criminal with a bad record and a history of violating the law who becomes a deputy police officer for some reason.
In the face of high--interest loans, why they did not report to the police, in the film, the police specifically asked whether they were in a difficult situation.
A grown-up person knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to use a room key to open the door of a dormitory, and then forcefully arranges to find the owner of the dormitory and sleeps outside the room door for a night..
This kind of nonsensical storyline permeates the entire film, because the storyline is so nonsensical that, when he remembers it, he feels pained by it.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about the film is its main theme, or rather, the fact that the film has no main theme at all, and is nothing but a collection of grotesque characters..
At the beginning of the film, one will think that he wants to make a comedy film, 20 minutes later, one suspects that it may be a motivational film. Halfway through the film, one thinks that it may be a drama depicting the life of a small- town youth, and after the film is over, one does not even know what kind of film he actually watched. This is followed by a deep sense of self--doubt. It was a waste of time to go to the cinema to watch the film.
For the most part, most people are already very familiar with the standard formula for most films, such as the story of a motorcycle racer, which involves a coming- of age story with a comedic twist.
If he wants to make a romantic film, he should make a film about a young man from a small town who falls in love with a waitress girl..
If he wants to depict the real world, then at the very least, his storyline should not contain things that are out of sync with the normal world.
(e.g. the character played by Ajit Vadakayil, the new motorbike that was burnt, but still able to sing a song) cannot open some of the holes in the brain that cannot be resisted by Kennedy..
As for the female protagonist, she is not a weak- minded person, but in some ways she behaves like a 5- year old child, and I don't know whether it is due to her acting skills or the director's request.
There is also one point that I do not quite understand: why, as a Formula 1 driver,, Håkan Nørgaard is so keen to include crash scenes in his own film..
The film's release during the Spring Festival holidays is a clear indication that the filmmakers are trying to give the audience a hard time.

Checking well lining concrete block module manufacturing and processing equipment in Zhengzhou.
The masonry block machine is widely used in the construction of underground structures for coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas. it is a new type of construction material.
e.g. all types of inspection wells, drainage and rainwater outlets, ditches, sewage tanks and small--scale constructions, wing walls of bridges..
The advantage of using prefabricated concrete blocks to build a drainage inspection shaft is that the four sides of the blocks have a concave and convex groove structure, which, when combined, form a chain lock.
The masonry walls of the dam have a much higher resistance to shear force than the masonry walls of the embankment.
The module is made of a hollow structure, when put together, the vertical holes are connected and the horizontal holes are connected. After the core is filled with concrete, a network of reinforced concrete is formed, providing a second strengthening and waterproofing effect.
Both the longitudinal and transverse ribs have a groove for reinforcing bars, which increases the structural strength of the entire structure.
In addition, the use of concrete inspection and drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage drainage

The wall of the well body is made of a modular mechanical hydraulic system using a single piston hydraulic system and a double piston hydraulic system.
The independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the impact of the main machine vibrations on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The masonry inspection shaft module cement block machine equipment fabric bag hopper advancing mold, dismantling mold, hopper storage hopper door closing, self-- propelled by a hydraulic system independent of each other, thereby reducing the wear and tear of machinery and maintenance.
The concrete inspection shaft module molding machine uses imported computer and electrical equipment, seals, hydraulic components, which ensures that the overall performance of the machine is stable and reliable.
The body of the vibrating plate is made of a whole plate of steel, the surface of the platform is cut with a laser, and there are no welding points. This allows the gravel box to move freely in the direction it is guided, minimizing mechanical wear and tear.
This reduces the weight of the mold, increases the amount of filler, and reduces the amplitude of the vibrations by combining the vibrations of the mold and the vibrations of the mold into a single unit, ensuring that the vibrations achieve the desired effect.
The wall of the bunker is made of a modular body of a mechanical vibrating machine, a vibrating machine with computerized automatic control of the vibrating amplitude, which adjusts the vibrating amplitude according to the characteristics of the raw material, and which does not wear out the brake, thereby prolonging the lifespan and reducing the cost.

The Chongqing vocational school pilot modern apprenticeship system entered the company's apprentice - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, a reporter from the city education bureau learned that from this year onwards, the city will try out the modern apprentice training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. The students enrolled in these schools will receive the apprentice title at the same time, and they will be recruited by the companies after graduation.
The Beijing Education Commission demanded that the standardize the recruitment and acceptance of students at vocational schools and the hiring of workers at enterprises. The dual identity of students at vocational schools and workers at enterprises should be made clear, the recruitment and acceptance of students at vocational schools and the hiring of workers at enterprises should be done in accordance with the principle of mutual selection, and a three--way agreement should be signed between the student, the school, and the enterprise. Students who are 16 years of age or older but not yet 18 years of age must sign a three--way agreement between the student, the guardian, the school, and the enterprise. The agreement must specify the rights and responsibilities of each party, as well as the details of the student's on- the job training.
To encourage the trial schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and to cooperate with the enterprises to carry out pre--employment training and post--employment training.
The pilot schools must reform the way they educate their students.
the college and the company jointly designed the curriculum for the cultivation of human resources, jointly formulated the curriculum standards, the course standards, the position standards, the master craftsman standards, the quality control standards, and the corresponding implementation plan.
The trial period is based on a bachelor's degree curriculum, and the time of the internship in a company is determined according to the specialist training plan, and the top- job internship usually lasts for six months.
In the practice of the enterprise, the enterprise should implement the management model of the apprentice system, according to the characteristics of the different professions, one master could lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that the apprentices would be able to master the skills required for each of the training positions.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to 2019 August, the city established three batches of 60 city- level modern vocational high school apprentice training trial points, with each trial point having 50 or more apprentices and a total of 3,000 or more apprentices trained.
In accordance with the principle of first trying out the pilot and then rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the principle of going from point to point and then gradually rolling it out to the rest of the country, the

A South African doctor says the Omicron variant is highly contagious but tends to cause mild illness.
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those of the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to a report by the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus in South Africa, the spread of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus in South Africa's Limpopo province, a group of 5,000 doctors in the province reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, symptoms similar to those of the flu.
The group's chief medical officer, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he saw dozens of patients each day, but none required hospitalization.
Pile said ： " They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation 。 "
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more susceptible to severe illness from a coronavirus infection.
He said, in contrast, in the previous wave of the Delata infection, he treated a new coronary patient who " had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people are admitted to the hospital within a few days.
In the first two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect sufficient data, the doctor's observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) summary, only 30% of the hospitalized new coronavirus patients were severely ill, which is half of the proportion of severe illness in the first wave of the epidemic. The average length of stay in the hospital was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days. Only 3% of the hospitalized new coronavirus patients died, while in the first wave of the epidemic in South Africa, 20 % of the patients died.
The head of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports to say, "at the moment, all the evidence points to this being a relatively mild disease. "
He also said: "It is still early days and we need to gather more data.
Normally, hospitalization and death occur later, and the time of entering this wave of the epidemic is only two weeks.. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still the world's most prevalent strain of the new coronavirus, cases of Omicron have been reported in more than 30 countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the province saw a 400% increase in new cases in the first week of December, tests showed that 90% of the cases were caused by the Omicron variant.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes were all sent out.

Election time assessment: what it takes to rescue kidnapped children.
If the class- comparison "there is no buying and selling, there is no killing" of the famous public welfare advertisement slogan, then, in the absence of " trafficking " demand, in a favorable environment, group prevention and group punishment, and all-- citizen anti- trafficking, this type of crime would not be profitable, dangerous, and costly, and would not occur frequently.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency platform for the dissemination of information on missing children.
This was created to establish an authoritative channel for the dissemination of information on missing children, and to quickly reunite abducted children with their families.
Hearing the name of this app as " circle of friends " makes one feel warm.
The new technological means are not only named "artistic" but also informationized use is appropriate, realistic and effective.
The main objective of kidnapping law enforcement is to recover kidnapped children, to protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, to social prevention and law education, can be listed with many " big words " 。
However, before the child trafficking case is solved, the safety of the victim's person should be prioritized.
In the face of the urgency of the "search for rescue" mission, issues such as " whether kidnapped children should be subject to the death penalty " and other controversial topics can be temporarily set aside, discussed cautiously. However, the issue of rescuing kidnapped children, for example, should not be discussed.
According to the experience of investigating this type of case, human traffickers are accustomed to leaving the scene as soon as they get their hands on the victims..
Every minute that the search and rescue operation is delayed, the distance between the child and his or her parents may increase by one step, and the difficulty of the investigation also increases by one step..
In this case, the use of such a direct method as the "Bumiputera Bersatu" (Bumiputera United) platform is an effective way to solve the case and find the missing children.
After all, " retrieval " is a task that requires the entire law enforcement system to work well.
To prevent crime, protect children and safeguard the rights of parents, everything from legislation to judiciary and law enforcement needs to be carried out in accordance with the principle of "protecting the weak and vulnerable".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking from the family to the society can still be improved.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is taking a break at a train station, the parents are sleeping and only realize that the child is missing when they wake up..
One cannot expect a two- year old child to have enough self- protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, one should at least have the same level of protection awareness.
The parents take turns to rest, or the child is placed under the protection of a safe place, are the most basic measures to prevent children from being kidnapped.
From the other side of the police's fight against child trafficking, the other side of the child traffickers should also be investigated and punished.
A single act of misconduct is often only one link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the minimum punishment for kidnapping and selling children is 5 years, and the maximum punishment is the death penalty, with confiscation of property.
The crime of kidnapping and selling children is obviously one of the crimes that are punished more severely in the trend of "lightening the punishment".
To this day, there are still many cases of child trafficking..
It can be seen that some people's views on raising children are outdated and their legal awareness is thin..
The law and order education of this part of the population should keep pace.
In order to effectively control the crime of child trafficking, it is not enough to rely solely on the strict enforcement of official regulations.
If the " market " for kidnapping is widespread, the kidnappers' greed will drive them to continuously invent new kidnapping methods, creating a situation of a " battle of law enforcers " with the kidnappers. The kidnapping operation will inevitably become ineffective.
As a result, the elimination of outdated notions, the popularization of legal common sense also helps to root out child trafficking and child prostitution.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, with five grades.
The first pressing of olive oil or called as virgin olive oil, is directly extracted from fresh ripe olive fruits by mechanical cold pressing, after removing impurities, it becomes olive oil.
According to the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra virgin olive oil is the highest grade of olive oil. It is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, it has a mild herbal aroma, the acidity is less than 1%..
high quality first press olive oil ( Fine Virgin ) : the acidity is slightly higher than 2%,, but not exceeding it, the taste is pure and fragrant.
ordinary first press olive oil ( Virgin Olive Oil ) : the taste and flavor are still good, the acidity is less than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3% after the refining process.
refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Pure olive oil (Olive Oil ) : a mixture of refined olive oil and olive oil with a certain proportion, to blend the taste and color, its acidity is below 1.5%, and it is transparent with a pale yellow color.
refined olive- pomace oil ( Refined Olive-Pomace Oil ) is obtained by extracting and purifying the oil from the oil mash.
One who has studied the acidity classification of olive oil should have already discovered that the acidity of olive oil is one of the most important indicators.
After all, the production of olive oil from olives is similar to the production of wine from grapes, which come from different regions and different varieties of olives. As a result, olive oil of different standards is produced.
The olive tree's best growing areas are:
The coastal areas of the Mediterranean have the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive trees, with the most suitable soil and climatic conditions
except for the coast of the Mediterranean, other areas can only be planted sporadically in suitable habitats.
The main production area is the Mediterranean region.
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan and Lebanon, as well as countries with similar climates in the Southern Hemisphere, such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc.
Olive harvesting month:
From 3 to 6 June each year, the olive tree flowers and bears fruit. From 7 to 10 October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, changing from green to red, purple and finally black.
From November to the following February is the fruit harvesting season ( the freshness of the olive oil is very important ).
The nutritional value of olive oil :
Olive oil is rich in fatty acids such as monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all oils found so far.
The democratic summit ended, Biden said that the flame of freedom would never be extinguished.
The Summit for Democracy, which was called by US President Barack Obama and attended by leaders from 110 countries, as well as representatives of the government, civil society and private sector,, ended on Friday (Dec. 10).
Biden said in his closing speech that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and cannot be extinguished by an authoritarian regime.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global " democratic summit " next year.
The Taiwanese government representative and political affairs commissioner Tang Fang and the currently in exile in the United Kingdom Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, Ro Cunningham also spoke at the second day of the summit.
Biden said: "We know that the work that lies before them is daunting.
But they also know that they can face challenges, because they have previously said that the world of democracy is everywhere, just as the recent APEC summit has shown.
The autocratic political regime can never extinguish the small flame of freedom, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world..
Mr. Biden also said that the defense of democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said: "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to their citizens, to strengthen the democratic shield, to push for reform, to achieve transparency in governance, and to resist the pressure of authoritarianism and the force of those who want to grab power in the name of public interest. "
The second day's theme was defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering digital authoritarianism, as well as reaffirming the value of democracy.
This day coincides with " International Human Rights Day " 。
The Secretary General of the United Nations, Guterres, also said in his opening speech on the same day that the democratic cause is facing challenges all over the world, especially in the face of the new challenges posed by the emergence of new digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm common values and standpoints and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving the problem of inequality, cracking down on corruption, updating the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also needs to condemn all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.  "
The Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, Roo Cunyu delivered a pre--recorded speech at the summit, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the situation of Hong Kong and the Uighur and Tibetan ethnic minorities in China.
He said ： " For a long time, the world has been affected by China's rise, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable.
This is why political leaders and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use all the resources they have at their disposal ( resources ) to ensure that the restoration of democracy is their first priority. "
Roh also called on the free world to unite against the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party..
He said: " perhaps some of them are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of them do not want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps they are not aware of ( the Chinese Communist Party's ) threat to their democratic values.
And this is the reason for their failure.
This is also the reason why they have to change 。 "
Tao Fang, a member of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of the Executive Council of
He also shared his experience of how information transparency and building mutual trust can be used to counter the new coronavirus epidemic..
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in full bloom, we have always stood firmly on the front line of the world's struggle against authoritarianism, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the period of the epidemic, the bureaucratic governments of each region used the pretext of public health and collective interest to legitimize the infringement of human rights, and the global democratic movement showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, it is not necessary to seal the city to control the spread of the disease and it is not necessary to shut down the airwaves to defeat false information. "
The United States Department of the Treasury announced on the second day of the " People's Democracy Conference " that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and a few other countries, and that it would also impose sanctions on a Chinese company that uses surveillance technology to assist in the violation of human rights.

Hello, the chicken sent by the dining hall was alive.
He wanted to try tennis, but he was afraid that he would not be able to keep it up, so he wanted to first find a similar price to practice his hand.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often in inverse proportion to the friendliness level, if not able to differentiate, the expensive one is actually the normal one, while the cheap one is actually industrial waste. This type of " entry level camera " is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, the ball hits the racket's head and the vibrations are very strong, the hard ball cannot withstand it and the top players have a hard time controlling it.
Their logic and subtext is that tennis is so difficult, that they don't know how to play, and that they don't want to spend a lot of money on it, and that they play two times and then they don't want to play anymore.
when he can tell the difference between good and bad, that means he has made progress, then he can come back later to buy more expensive things, and he will earn twice as much money..
The suggestion is to buy a second--hand racket similar in quality to a new one for the same price, to choose between Prince or Ding Junping's, these two brands are not well known, so a good racket can be sold for the same price. A new racket costs 500 or 600 yuan, a second- hand racket costs 200 yuan, the enjoyment of a 1,000 yuan racket is the same.
The game is friendly to new players, but after the new player phase, it becomes useless, but the majority of people, especially female players, cannot pass the new player phase.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed several times.
Asked if they could follow up on it a bit more,.
postponed

In fact, there are a lot of things to be taken into consideration when dressing up for a woman with a small figure.
The skirts worn by fat girls should not be too short or too long. they should be long enough to cover the thighs, just enough to cover the fattest part of the legs.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the thighs will be exposed.
If they are too long, they give the impression of being short and fat.
If the outfit is divided into three segments, the upper, middle and lower sections, it gives the impression that the wearer has grown taller, with the upper, skirt and long socks in different colours giving the impression of a long, slim figure 。
In fact, a lot of dark--colored clothing is the standard attire for slender young women, and dark colors are a good way to conceal a pudgy body. a black short skirt is the first choice of slender young women.
Wearing dark- colored clothes, especially black shorts, will make people think that they are slimmer..
If the thighs are very fat, the socks and shoes should not be worn too conspicuously.
The more popular it is, the better, and the color should not be too bright.
to avoid people paying attention to his legs and feet, he wanted to make people feel fat and plump.
For a girl who is slightly overweight, it is necessary to talk about how to dress in a way that suits her.
A fat girl should not wear a tight--fitting short skirt, nor should she wear an upper garment that is too short or is tucked into the skirt, which makes her feel uncomfortable. If she has thick legs, she should wear a black long stocking or a patterned stocking ( the kind with small squares ) , and she should wear a skirt with a floral print, and she should wear an upper garment with a ruffled collar, which can hide her shortcomings.
Needless to say, a short skirt worn by a petite girl also has its own rules..
A pudgy girl should wear a top that matches the color of her short skirt, which will make her pudgy body appear taller..
A short skirt paired with high heels can make the wearer's legs appear more slender, this is the most fashionable way to dress in the summer.
If the upper body is fat, but the legs are thin, the MM, the recommendation is to choose a glamorous look with a short skirt.
Not only able to cover a big belly, it can also show off one's assets..
A short skirt would be very revealing and would be more suitable for thin girls. a tight--fitting top would create a layered effect, which would make the wearer look slimmer.
A simple white T--shirt paired with a short skirt can also be tried by plump Ms.
A small, plump girl is also able to wear outfits that give off a sense of fashion..
As long as they are able to master the rules of dressing, women with a small figure will also be the focus of the gaze of a million people..
In terms of clothing, there have been some changes, but in daily life, it is also necessary to be more active and try to get out of the micro-fat girl label as soon as possible.

The girl was shot as a target for her sister's fundraising: " I thought it was just a flesh wound, so it was not so bad " - Xinhua News Agency.
At the Hangzhou Martial Arts Square, a young girl stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan per shot" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a girl from Hangzhou who was willing to be a " target " for her sister's fundraising went viral on social media.
The photographs show a young girl standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan per shot" written on it.
This action sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Yesterday evening, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou's downtown district confirmed to a reporter from the Beijing News that the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou's downtown district confirmed that the girl was the beneficiary of the fundraising event, but that this kind of behavior was not worth promoting. After being admonished, the girl left the local police station the next day.
The girl's street-side "arrow target" fundraising was discouraged.
The picture shows a girl with long hair standing in front of a large wooden board with black ink writing "human flesh target, 10 yuan per shot" on it. There is another wooden board in front of her with her bank account number and her WeChat and Alipay account numbers written on it.
The picture went viral after it was posted on the internet.
There are some netizens who believe that this is a " begging for sympathy " act, and there are also many netizens who sympathize with him.
" Around 10:00 a.m. on the 23rd, they were patrolling around the square when they noticed the situation. at that time, the crowd of onlookers was already quite large. "
The incident took place near the Tianshui police station, where local media were allowed to interview the two female teenagers, who were aged between 20 and 25 years old, and were dressed in a youthful manner.
One of the girls was crying and begging passers-by to play a game with her, while the other girl was standing on the side asking for help, saying that her friend's sister was suffering from white blood disease and was in need of surgery. she was begging for help.
"They contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's bone marrow treatment. "
Yesterday evening, the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou's downtown district announced that the girl's name is Ji Guilin, and that she is the sister of Ji Guilin.
However, due to the treatment still costing 30 million yuan, at the time, he could not think of a better way to raise funds than this.
He said that during the entire process, two young girls were used as targets, one as the target and the other as the shooter, but that neither of them took part in the process. During the entire process, no one shot an arrow, but there were people watching and taking pictures, which were later posted on microblogging websites.
After the police examined the bows and arrows used by the perpetrators, it was found that they did not belong to the category of prohibited weapons.
The responsible person said, " We do not encourage this type of fundraising. "
After being warned by a police officer at the police station, she has left the police station.

What was most popular in 2021.
The 2020 Summer Olympics were held in Tokyo, Japan.
He thought that only Olympic athletes could win awards.
A few months ago, a piece of writing titled "A project manager can win a gold medal at the Olympic Games" became very popular. It mentions that project managers are able to win gold medals in many projects, as they are the only ones who are able to do so. They are able to do so because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to do so, because they are the only ones who are able to
A seemingly playful piece of writing, it also reveals the daily hardships faced by project managers, which represent a lack of enthusiasm for the current project management work..
And those who work in project management are also gradually choosing to use some actions to get themselves out of the predicament of their work..
From the yearly increase in the number of PMP (internationally recognized certification for project management professionals) applicants, it can be seen that more and more project management professionals are improving their project management skills by studying.
According to the China project management 20-year development report (1999-2019), the total number of people who applied for the PMP® certification was nearly 6 million, the number of people who passed the PMP® certification was about 4.2 million, and the number of people who had the PMP® certification was about 3 million, which accounted for 31.2% of the global PMP® certification total.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMPs has increased year after year. This indicates that more and more project managers are realizing that relying on the old ways of doing things is no longer possible in the face of a constantly changing work environment. they must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the path ahead.
However, obtaining the PMP certification does not guarantee that project management work will run smoothly.
Many project management newcomers said that by studying the PMP or IPMP course, they could systematically master the ten major areas and five major process groups of project management, but when they actually started working in project management, they were still in the dark.
Many project managers often complain about the following problems: 1. a lack of project management knowledge, which is based solely on personal experience, 2. a lack of a systematic project management theory, 3. a lack of support from a system of project management procedures, 4. a lack of the ability to implement project management on the ground, 5. an inaccurate assessment of the project, 6. a lack of the ability to coordinate between departments, 7. a lack of the ability to coordinate between departments, 8. a lack of the ability to coordinate between departments, 9. a lack of the ability to coordinate between departments, 10. a lack of the ability to coordinate between departments, 11. a lack of the ability to coordinate between departments, 12. a lack of the ability to coordinate between departments, 13. a lack of the ability to coordinate between departments, 14. a lack of the ability to coordinate between departments, 15. a lack of the ability to coordinate between departments, 16. a lack of the ability to coordinate between departments, 17. a lack

Jie Xin " Double 12 " eve urged consumers to be rational in their consumption - Economic Observer - a professional financial news website.
This year's " Double 11 " shopping frenzy, the total amount of business transactions in the nation's online payment industry reached 17.7 billion yuan, a new record.
The flower-like variety of red packets, the attention-- grabbing livestreamed shopping, the phenomenon of direct selling once again made consumers feel the benefits, which, on the one hand, made people marvel at the strength of national consumption and, on the other hand, made them reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group.
On the eve of " double 12 " , Jie Xin Consumer Financial Co., Ltd. ( hereinafter referred to as " Jie Xin " ) issued a call for rational consumption, urging young people in particular to cultivate a good sense of consumption and consumption habits, to avoid blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the People's Bank of China's 2019 Consumer Financial literacy survey analysis report, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
On the whole, the Chinese population's performance in the field of financial consumption is good, but in terms of different aspects of financial behavior and skills, there is a large disparity, and there is still a need to improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
2020 China's young generation consumption report and 2019 – 2020 China's young generation debt situation report published by CCTV- Money and Finance reveal that the young generation has enormous potential for consumption and that consumption upgrades are taking place through the use of credit products. 86.6% of the young generation are using credit products and nearly half of them do not have any debt accumulation. The young generation are susceptible to being swayed by advertising and marketing campaigns.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jie Xin has always strived to provide high quality and considerate service to help the people build their own happy lives and to encourage the people, especially those in the younger generation, to develop a sense of rational consumption. Jie Xin has also actively responded to the government's call to promote a sense of rational consumption among the people, especially those in the younger generation.
Over the past several years, Jiexiang has continuously targeted young people, including university students, with a wide range of financial literacy awareness campaigns. It has also collaborated with China's top universities to launch a wide variety of financial literacy awareness campaigns, including creative, multi--faceted initiatives, such as a financial literacy awareness competition. These campaigns have helped young people to develop a rational view of consumption, plan their consumption needs, and help them to accumulate wealth over the course of their lives.
In the run-up to Double 12, Jie Xin reminds all consumers to cultivate a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct understanding of money, to resist impulsive and excessive consumption and to avoid entering the consumption debt zone, in order to avoid affecting one's personal credit record and one's future economic life.
Consumption time must be planned in advance, that is to say, it is necessary to make the most of the time available. It is also necessary to be punctual in paying back the debt.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the individual's credit report, which may have a negative impact on the individual's future economic life, such as buying a car or purchasing a house.
At the same time, while enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose legitimate institutions and channels, and also pay attention to ensuring that the relevant institutions have the necessary operating permits.
In the future, Jie Xin will continue to rely on its mature and dependable consumer finance system and continuously updated and improved financial products to provide consumers with more tailor-made and diversified services, continuously assisting them in raising their level of financial knowledge, helping them to develop a rational approach to consumption and a moderate approach to borrowing, and making them their lifetime dependable partner in consumer finance.

Vietnamese People's Newspaper - The Bay of Bengal Cooperative Mechanism responds to common challenges.
The stopover of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman included Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Noteworthy is that this is the first time since Saudi Arabia and its Arab League allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in 2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis, that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has visited Qatar.
In the midst of this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed an all--embracing trade embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
the tightening of diplomatic relations had a serious impact on the internal cohesion of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries closed all land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the 2021 January 1st Gulf Cooperation Council summit, when all Gulf nations signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move toward " unity and stability " in the region.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors.
The resolution of the dispute between the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and Qatar, aimed at restoring relations between the countries for mutual benefit and the stability of the region, is based on the need for the countries to unite in order to face common challenges.
During the Saudi King's visit to Oman, the two countries agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf nations.
The 725 km long roadway connecting the two countries will facilitate the outbound travel of the citizens of the two countries and the integration of the supply chains of the two countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest 500 million USD in Oman, and 300 million USD worth of 13 memorandums of understanding were signed between Saudi and Omani companies.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf Arab countries coincided with Iran's negotiations with the world's major countries to save the name of the " Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action " ( JCPOA ) - an agreement between Iran and the world's major countries that was condemned by the Gulf Arab countries because they could not solve the issue of Iranian missiles.
The countries of the Persian Gulf have always seen Iran as a long--term " rival " and have seen Iran's nuclear program as a threat to the region's security.
The countries of the Persian Gulf believe that, without resolving the issue of Iran's ballistic missiles, without taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region, it is inadequate.
Against the backdrop of the failure of the nuclear talks between the major powers and Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
Its objective is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming ASEAN summit will be the first since the dispute between some member countries and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to reassess its efforts to promote cooperation among its member states, while also proposing a series of measures to ensure that its member states work together to meet common challenges in order to contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago, the Aventador LP700-4.

Getting in and out of the car requires practice, otherwise it can be a bit awkward ( because it gets stuck halfway in and out of the car )
The engine noise is too loud, after getting off the car, the ear suddenly becomes deaf. (but it is still very hot).)
The car body is too large, parking in a regular parking space is very narrow, it is very afraid of being hit by the neighbor's car opening the door at that time.
There is a bit of loneliness, because there is no opponent on the road ( the small editor himself said, it has nothing to do with the car owner, ha ha ha )

to make the spirit of a great university and the spirit of the times resonate at the same frequency - Xinhua News Agency
The so-called spirit of a great university is a set of ideas and values that a great university has developed over a long period of time. it is the soul of a great university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been crucial to the development of politics, economics, culture, science and technology, as well as a nation's progress.
From the birth of the first modern university in the world, the mission of the university has been different from that of other social organizations. For China,, the university was born in the autumn of the national crisis, and its spirit has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changing of the times. It advocates the values of "promoting virtue and benefiting the world" and " strengthening science and strengthening the country. "
At present, the trend toward informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more apparent, and the global competition for education, science and technology, and human resources is becoming more and more intense. The higher education sector, as an important "supply side" of the economy, is undergoing a structural reform that is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the release of the " Overall plan for comprehensively advancing the construction of world--class universities and world--class academic disciplines " has shown China's determination to move from a country with a large number of universities to a country with a large number of strong universities. At the same time, it has also raised the requirements for the development of universities.

In particular, it is important to note that building a world--class university cannot be done by a hundred different schools, each of which has its own strengths, but which must at the same time show individuality and distinctiveness.
The bureaucracy of the school must have a common Chinese characteristic, but must also reflect the unique characteristics of each school in terms of its mission, tradition and resource endowment.

In the course of this process, it is especially important to maintain the spirit of the university, to make the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For the part of Zhejiang University, "seeking truth and pursuing knowledge" is the school motto, " diligence, piety, discernment and perseverance " constitute the school's common value system, and " welcoming the sea and embracing the river " constitute the school's newest expression of its spirit.
This is the school's commitment to upholding the correct path of running the school, constantly accumulating the school's high level of culture and consolidating the school's spirit of unity and solidarity. meaningful and far--reaching.

This series of spiritual ideals and value pursuits is exactly what has made the 120 years of Wenzhou University's existence what it is.
"The wise hear without hearing, the intelligent see without sight. "
China's universities should further focus on the overall situation of the socialist society with Chinese characteristics, deepen their understanding of the historical mission of higher education, and speed up the construction of a world--class university.
At the same time, the university adheres to its humanistic and independent spirit, which allows the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times, the spirit of the nation, and the spirit of mankind to intermingle, thereby providing an inexhaustible source of energy for achieving the prosperity of the country and the rejuvenation of the nation and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

A group of Asian American students have filed a complaint against Yale, Princeton, and other members of the elite group of eight colleges known as the " Ivy League " for discriminating against them in the admissions process.
On May 23, the New China News Agency reported that 130 Asian American groups submitted a petition to the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice protesting that three of the nation's most prestigious liberal arts colleges, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian American applicants in their admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance held a news conference the same day in Washington, D.C. to announce the filing of the lawsuit.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yulong, said at a press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top universities has increased by the hundreds, but in these three American top universities, the proportion of Asians is basically the same.
Many studies have shown that these elite universities engage in long--term, systematic discrimination against Asian- American applicants in their admissions process.
According to Zhao Yulong,, 2014 research by Sander and other scholars showed that among these three universities,, Asian Americans had the lowest acceptance rate among all ethnic groups.
The data from the United States Department of Education also shows that among all the members of the Association of the Eight Ivy League universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest acceptance rate for Asian students, while Yale University and Brown University had the lowest acceptance rate for Asian applicants for 20 years or more.
Zhao Yulong told a reporter from the Xinhua News Agency that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would conduct an investigation and, after determining the facts, take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students.
They also hoped that colleges and universities would actively address this issue and change their admissions policies for Asian Americans.
As of now, the 3 universities that have been sued have yet to respond.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University's admissions process, but the U.S. Department of Education ruled that the process was not discriminatory.
This time, in addition to the American Chinese group, the American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani American educational groups participated in the petition.

In September 2020, Mr. Lai learned from a real estate agent about a factory building located in the Beizhou Town of Yueyang County in Zhejiang Province. After several visits to the site, Mr. Lai decided to buy the factory building.
On the same day, Mr. Liu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory with the owner of the house, Lin Xiaoming, and transferred 20 million yuan as a deposit to the bank.
Ling signed the contract as the recipient of the deposit money, which stated that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit money would go to the seller, and if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit money would be doubled back to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign a factory purchase contract within a week.
However, the two sides were unable to reach an agreement on the scope of the sale of the factory, the payment method, and other major terms of the contract, which delayed the signing of the factory building purchase contract.
Giving consideration to the fact that the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin Xiang handed 2 million yuan in advance payment back to Mr. Lai.
The house that was hard to get, the deposit was paid, the money for the house was also ready, just before signing the contract, the seller changed his mind and refused to sell the house, which made Mr. Liang angry and frustrated.
For this reason, Mr. Liu sued Mr. Lin to the Beiluo District People's Court.
The court, after reviewing the case, concluded that the two parties were not able to sign a formal contract and that the defendant could not be solely blamed for the failure of the negotiations. Therefore, the case should not apply to the double the deposit penalty clause, and the defendant did not have to pay double the deposit as compensation for the breach of contract.
After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed.
In recent days, the second court of appeal upheld the original verdict.
The lawyer warns that in the course of a transaction, it is necessary to exercise due diligence.
When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is the buyer's duty to exercise due diligence, such as verifying the owner of the property, whether the property has been occupied by someone else, and so on. In the contract, the buyer must specify the exact time and place of the delivery of the property, in order to avoid disputes when the contract is fulfilled.
After the end of the " People's Democracy Summit " on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Sunday (11 December) that the United States hosted the " Leadership Summit of the People's Democracy " , which was " using ideology as a dividing line, turning democracy into a weapon, using the name of democracy to carry out anti-- democratic acts, stirring up confrontation between nations, diverting domestic tensions " .
The Chinese government believes that " for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and its own value system on others, forced the " democratic transformation " on others, imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated " color revolutions " and caused catastrophic consequences.
" democracy " has already become the US's " weapon of mass destruction " to interfere in the affairs of other countries.
This biannual summit is the fulfillment of Biden's election pledge.
The conference lasted for two days and was held in a video format, with 111 heads of state from all over the world attending, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia did not receive an invitation.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States, saying that the United States did not have the right to host such a summit because of its own democratic problems.
Internationally and in the United States, there have been doubts about the motives of those invited to attend the summit, including some of the leaders of authoritarian regimes, such as those of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, who have questioned the motives of the Obama administration in organizing the summit.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video democracy summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is sick with the disease of money politics, identity politics, the politics of political parties, the politics of polarization, the politics of extremism, social division, racial tension, the politics of poverty and wealth disparity. " The American democracy is based on the foundation of money politics, " the game of rich people. "
President of the United States Barack Obama said in his speech that " as government leaders, they have a responsibility to listen to their citizens, strengthen the democratic shield, push for reform, achieve transparency in governance, and more effectively resist the pressure and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who seek power in the name of public interest before the naked pursuit of power. "
He stressed that democracy is not a given, "In my view, this is the defining challenge of this generation, to constantly renew it in every generation of people ," he said.
Mr. Biden also said that " democracy and human rights " are facing " persistent and worrying challenges " at a time when " democracy needs champions to defend it " .
The US side pledged to launch a one--year campaign after the end of the democracy summit, including a $424 million initiative to strengthen democracy in the world and to support independent news media.
The United States hopes that each country will make a specific, public commitment before the end of 2022 to improve its democratic system.
Biden said, " to make sure that all countries fulfill their commitments and report their progress by the end of next year " 。
I'm afraid he sent the letter to the wrong address.

It has been a long time since I came to Dayang, but the water fruit soup is still as tasty as before, and the use of genuine materials and real ingredients is still as good as ever, and the first time I had a bite of a burnt bun, it was just the way he likes, that is, the taste of the southern part of the country.

The red card drinking law is what.
Everyone's hobbies are different. Some like collecting, some like good food, and some like drinking whisky. Of course, there are also those who like to drink whisky. Red Label is currently the best--selling Scotch whisky in many countries., and it also won the gold medal at the international whisky competition.
Every bottle of red label whisky has its own distinct flavour, but if one does not know how to savour it, it would be a waste of its sweet aroma..
So, how to drink red card whisky.
The small editor explains to the public in a simple way.
The red card drinking law :
The biodiesel is made from about 35 varieties of Scottish whisky, and has a distinctive pungent aroma with hints of sweetness and smokiness.
The entrance to the whisky is rich and sweet, with hints of tobacco and smoky malted barley.
The alcohol can be directly mixed with ice to be used as a drink, or mixed with the most liked drink to be used as a drink.
Red- carded whisky enters the country, to adapt to the taste of the Chinese, whisky with carbonated beverages such as Coca- Cola or Pepsi, or bubble drinks such as Fanta or Sunkist became a long-- lasting fashion.
Theses sweet- tasting beverages, apart from being able to neutralize the acidic taste,, in the visual sense, can give people a sense of pleasure, by adding them to the beverages, they have the effect of changing the taste of the beverages.
The red- card whisky with a slice of lime and sugar is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
The original red wine has a slightly acidic taste, the addition of sugar can neutralize its acidic taste, lime juice can give the wine a fresh aroma, of course, the sweetness of the acidic taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
All three of these are the best ways to drink red- carded whisky, and people can use them as a reference to try them out. Hopefully, the editor's description will help people.
Thoughts on education: how university entrance exams make " smart students " and " dumb students " get what they deserve - Xinhua News Agency.
Three students from Lanzhou Transportation University wrote a letter to the university's leadership to complain about the difficulty of the university's entrance exam and to suggest raising the difficulty of the entrance exam, changing the type of entrance exam questions, and making the entrance exam more accurately reflect the students' actual abilities.
Indeed, for a long time, university entrance exams have been a " hot topic " 。
In a university campus, students come from five lakes and four oceans, they have different abilities and different levels of study, and the situation of studying is very different.
For a group with so many different characteristics, it is inevitable that there will be different perceptions of the situation.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type and are repeated too often, they are too simple and will give rise to a different kind of feeling.
The lazy student may be able to get a passing grade with a last--minute cramming session before the exam,, but if he wants to try other methods, he may be able to achieve a doubling of the effect..
As a result, " study slackers " who do not put much effort into their studies are able to pass exams and even get high grades, while " studious overachievers " who do not miss classes, homework, and notebooks are able to get high grades.
In this way, the students of Lanzhou University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, who protested against the university's entrance exam, did not do so out of nowhere. It is likely that this situation also exists in Lanzhou University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
From this perspective, it is necessary to give a thumbs- up to the three students who wrote the open letter.
In fact, those who have graduated from university are well aware that, in order to prepare for the exams in a short period of time,, they have resorted to all sorts of ways to obtain exam questions from their professors, have tried to expand the scope of their exams, and have even resorted to getting special attention from their professors during the exams. This phenomenon is not uncommon, and even during the exams, they have resorted to carrying small notes with them, and after the exams, they have resorted to asking their professors to give them special attention.
In the author's view, the quality of a university's examinations can be judged on the basis of how well its professors understand teaching and learning, and on the basis of this understanding, how well they are able to devise tests.
Entering the first year of a bachelor's degree, the specialty begins to specialize, many specialty courses are based on basic knowledge..
There is no doubt that whether or not the basic knowledge points of a particular field of study have been mastered is what is tested in university entrance examinations.
On the other hand, undergraduate knowledge is based on the basics of science and basic knowledge, and the knowledge points are basically the same. There is not much variation in terms of knowledge points.
just like what a teacher said, " 20 years ago, the basic knowledge of university- level mathematics was the same as it is now, and it is still being studied. it is still a focus. "
However, the knowledge points remain the same and do not represent a single type of test question or a repetition of test questions.
In many universities, the tests are generally composed by a group of professors, and the tests are then composed by a group of professors who are experts in the subject, and the tests are then scrutinized by a group of professors who are experts in the subject, and the tests are then scrutinized by a group of professors who are experts in the subject. In this way, a certain degree of repetition of the tests can be avoided.
However, it is necessary to devise a set of test questions that are in line with the actual situation of education and learning, that are based on the actual situation of the student's education and learning, that have a normal distribution in terms of difficulty, that are based on a comprehensive assessment of the actual situation of education and learning, and that are based on a comprehensive assessment of the actual situation of the student's education and learning, and that are based on a dynamic assessment of the difficulty and type of the test questions, and that are based on a dynamic assessment of the difficulty and type of the test questions, and that are based on a dynamic assessment of the difficulty and type of the test questions, and that are based on a dynamic assessment of the difficulty and type of the test questions, and that are based on a dynamic assessment of the difficulty and type of the test questions, and that are based on a dynamic assessment of the difficulty and type of the test questions, and that are based on a dynamic assessment of the difficulty and type of the test questions, and that are based on a dynamic assessment of the difficulty and type of the test questions, and that are based on a dynamic assessment of the
The university entrance exam is the baton of university education. the nature of the university entrance exam determines the nature of the preparation for the entrance exam. if this continues, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.

From the perspective of the mechanism, solving the problem of a single type of test and the repetition of the same test is a problem that the university examination service needs to deal with., of course, it is necessary to enact corresponding regulations,, but the hard work lies in the daily routine, and it is necessary for the teacher to have a full understanding of the situation of the classroom, not only to eat through the contents of the classroom, but also to eat through the situation of the students' studies., the two sides eating through each other will form a better interaction between teaching and learning, and the test will be more in line with the actual situation, so that the " academic elite " and the " academic slacker " will each get what they deserve.

The Sandakan National Registration Office said that due to the fact that the special anti- counterfeiting paper used to issue birth certificates for newborn babies is susceptible to light, since the beginning of October, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies, with a total of 3,200 people affected.
However, the head of the agency, Kailu Aminu, assured that all babies who had already applied for birth certificates had their paperwork recorded in the system, and that the anti-- counterfeiting paper would be delivered to the island in the coming week, after which the certificates would be reissued.
At a press conference, he addressed the issue of the newspaper's paper and printing problems, which lasted for more than 10 months, by making a clarification.

48 hours of negative nucleic acid test, set up a " buffer zone " - Xinhua News Agency.
The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a notice on the 11th of December to strengthen the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic prevention and control work in borderline coastal cities ( except those connected to Hong Kong and Macau ) in the near future. It required that people travelling to land- based borderline coastal cities ( except those connected to Hong Kong and Macau ) must have a 48 hour old nucleic acid test certificate, and that people arriving from land- based borderline coastal cities ( except those connected to Hong Kong and Macau ) must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arriving.
According to the notification, the time frame for the above requirement was from the date the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities determined the port city boundaries and announced it, to March 15,, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that conditional port cities can study setting up quarantine areas for the prevention and control of infectious diseases within their jurisdictions.
The head of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau said that for some border cities, cross-- border border trade is the main economic pillar of the city, and there are frequent visits between the two sides of the border.
It will implement a differential management policy based on the division of districts, which will change from one line of defense against outbreaks to two lines of defense, which is expected to move the front line of infection control forward, compress the risk of infection outbreaks, and achieve the maximum effect of infection control with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
There have been many outbreaks of localized epidemics in China recently, all of which were transmitted through the mouth of a border city.
The above--mentioned notice points out that this exposed some localities' inadequate surveillance and monitoring of infectious disease outbreaks, inadequate management of high--risk personnel, inadequate implementation of closed- loop management, inadequate implementation of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate management of cold chain logistics, inadequate management of quarantine facilities, inadequate handling of infectious disease outbreaks, and inadequate implementation of infectious disease emergency response.
The notice demanded that measures be taken to improve the disease prevention and control mechanisms of the border city, to strengthen the disease surveillance and early warning system, to implement border management measures, and to strengthen the city's disease prevention and control work, to tighten the disease prevention and control line from the outside.
The notice stressed that all border city municipalities should carry out epidemic prevention and disease control work in conjunction with the work of ensuring the basic livelihood of the people, publishing and facilitating the livelihood protection hotline, periodically inspecting the supply of basic livelihood goods and prices, resolving and responding to the outstanding issues raised by the public in a timely manner.
According to the notice, the cities with open land, water and air ports include the counties (cites, districts, autonomous prefectures) where the land, water and air ports are located, the cities ( provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities ) where the land, water and air ports are located, and the direct-controlled municipalities. Each province ( autonomous region, direct-controlled municipality ) determines and announces the specific boundaries in accordance with the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

Oil pipeline video reveals the truth of the US military's 20 years of bloodthirsty killings - Xinhua News Agency.
( video source from oil pipeline )
On 11 December 2011, the oil pipeline company released a micro documentary called "Killing Machine" which attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States, under the guise of fighting terrorism, waged a war in Afghanistan for 20 years, through which it tried to forcefully export American- style democracy. Through 20 years of war, the United States committed numerous crimes against humanity.
The misuse of unmanned drone air strikes on hospitals, schools and other civilian sites has twisted human nature, established a death squad.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up " black jails " to subject detainees to various forms of torture and humiliation.
A series of crimes against humanity provoked more Afghans to hate each other.
As the video shows, the American " anti--terrorism " war " becomes more and more terrifying. "
The war in Afghanistan has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity and hope to the people of Afghanistan. Instead, it has left the country in ruins and caused countless deaths.
Let's watch the video together to expose the true nature of the United States, which uses the pretext of fighting terrorism to slaughter innocent people, and to expose the false face of American democracy.
Inadvertently, he saw the following article, from a commercial perspective as well as from the perspective of the preservation period, discussing why this customer wanted to have the logistics company that operates in the protected area to help with canister filling, even though canister filling is considered deep processing and does not fall within the scope of operations of the protected area logistics company. This article may also explain why the customer wanted to do this.
He went to many dairy powder factories and saw many dairy powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for the powdered milk formula and the pouched milk formula are the same. there is no difference between them.
So naturally, people will ask why the bagged product has a shelf life of one year, while the canned product has a shelf life of two years or more.
or, they ask why the difference in price is so great between the two types of packaging.
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, believe that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality is much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but people believe that the more expensive ones are the better ones.
There are also consumers who eat it because of this kind of mindset, who say that the taste or smell of the food is different after eating it.
First of all, I would like to say to the audience that the reason for the high price of the tickets is that they are located in a good place.
Their raw materials are the same, but the difference in price is so great.
Because most of the manufacturers take into consideration the fact that if the bagged price is set too high, consumers would find it difficult to accept, this means that the manufacturer's profit is very low, or that there is no profit at all. This means that the manufacturer relies on what to survive.
This means that they were able to raise the price of their products to a very large extent to ensure their profit margins..
As a result, most of the manufacturers are promoting the use of hearing aids, rather than the use of earplugs.
and there are so many factories that spend millions of dollars each year on advertising. where this money comes from.
Everyone can imagine it for themselves.
With the development of society and the promotion of the market, expenditures such as those of the market's promotional staff, such as those of the market's promotional staff, those of the market's display staff, those of the market's giveaway staff, and those of the advertisement staff also increase continuously.
Therefore, each manufacturer is continuously releasing new products, all of which are hearing aids, and their prices are continuously increasing. In fact, these are new products that have been released due to the increase in production costs.
The main goal is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the increase in the cost of raw materials will not exceed 3 to 4 rupees.
There is also a part of the brand that, in order to promote its own product, does not hesitate to resort to any means, to get the doctors of the hospital to assist in the promotion of the product, from which they earn a profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan, depending on the quality of the product.
However, China's relevant laws prohibit the use of this type of operation method. In fact, this type of operation method is harmful to consumers.
It is suggested that people who have milk powder canisters at home should buy bagged milk powder and put it into the canisters. this way, they can save money and increase the milk powder's storage and sealability. it also has no effect on children.
Also, people shouldn't think that the shelf life of bags is longer than the shelf life of tubes. After opening the bag, the shelf life of the bag and the tube is the same, but it is easier for the bag to be affected by moisture and change its quality..
The lunch was late, the food was all cold, it was cold after that, it was hard and dry, it was impossible to eat.

Don't scare people off at the starting line - Xinhua News Agency
When visiting the book market, one can often feel the success of the so-called academic books.
Today's best-selling self--help books are full of " most important principles " — that is, they assume or imply that the reader can " do it " and then go on to tell the reader " what to do " .
This is equivalent to saying that he jumped over the "how to do it" part, which is actually the most important and fundamental part.
This is the reason why all these books have a common feature: they either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best or they do not do anything at all. They either do their best
This principle of " the best of the best " ， which makes everyone agree that it is " absolutely correct " , but 99% of people will be scared off before the starting line.
because this theory is based on the idea that people have to make a " 180- degree turn " in their lives, and this is something that many people are unable to do.
For people who are set in their ways, we have to be right next to them, shouting "you need to change" at them, which is self--sabotage and a cow's way of doing things.
The overwhelming majority of people will hesitate when they see the two words "turnover" in front of them. They will be reluctant to take a step forward, hesitant to make a decision; or they will make a decision based on a momentary impulse, and then courageously take the first step, but they often fail after a short while and give up.
Mr. Ma's famous " From tomorrow onwards " skit from the film " From tomorrow onwards " perfectly depicted this " universal human nature " in a classic manner.
The biggest problem with the " most stringent principle " is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's abilities and makes them " look at the closed door and sigh. "
or perhaps, " second- best principles " are a kind of path that can lead more ordinary people to relative success.
The core of the " second good principle " lies in " lowering the threshold " — — it encourages a theory of " accumulating small victories as big victories " — i.e., if one does not reach 100, it is enough to reach 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if one does not climb to the top of Mount Tai, it is enough to climb to the top of a small sand dune in front of one's house, because it is always greater than the original location.
In short, it is better to have done something than not to have done anything..
Due to the lowering of the threshold, the possibility of ordinary people to persevere has increased, and so has the likelihood of success if they persevere.
Only following the "second best principles" of success, its path is slightly longer than it should have been..
In the end, the " best " principle, although it flies the banner of making all people successful, is in fact able to motivate more people than the " second best " principle, to the extent possible, to benefit as many people as possible.

The stock of greenback carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 71,000 tonnes this year - Xinhua News Agency
The New China News Agency reported on December 11, 2012 from the Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the Province of Qinghai that the latest monitoring results showed that the stock of the Qinghai Lake Amur carp resource has increased by 71,000 tonnes compared to the previous year and reached 1.085 million tonnes, which is 40 times more than in 2002.
The naked trout, also known as the Laba River fish, is a rare fish species found in the waters of Lake Qinghai. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological chain of water, fish and birds in the Qinghai River basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, as a result of large- scale fishing, the environment around the lake deteriorated and the population of the lake trout declined sharply. In 2002, the stock of lake trout in the lake was only 2,592 tonnes.
In the 2004 edition of the Chinese Red List of Endangered Species, the greenback cutthroat trout was listed as an endangered species.
Since 2003, the province of Qinghai has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and the lake's main tributaries, prohibiting any organization, collective, or individual from fishing in Qinghai Lake and the lake's main tributaries. The ban also prohibits the sale of fish from Qinghai Lake and its tributaries.
At the same time, through artificial breeding release and cleaning up of the main inflowing rivers of Qinghai Lake, as well as designing scientific and reasonable " fish passages " and other measures, the protection efforts for the lake's sturgeon resources have been stepped up year after year.
Yuan Lin, deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Qinghai Province, said that as of now, more than 180 million juvenile fish have been released into the waters of Qinghai Lake, contributing to the restoration of the Qinghai Lake carp resource at a rate of more than 23 percent.

In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Springs area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, to protect the water wildlife of the Three Rivers Springs area and to protect the biodiversity of the Qinghai- Tibet Plateau, since the beginning of this year, Qinghai has successively issued a ban on fishing in the Three Rivers Springs area, the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the waters of Qinghai Lake. It has established a "one river, one river, one lake" comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

I just read an example essay that was too long..
Giving men who don't know much about the female reproductive system a bit of female reproductive system science.
The vast majority of female teenagers will experience their first period between the ages of 13 and 15 at some point during that period, and menopause usually occurs between the ages of 50.
As long as the body is healthy, the menstrual cycle will be more regular, will come once a month.
However, it is not regular enough to be able to accurately predict for a week or more in advance, with a margin of error of about a week. It needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes bad luck also causes a flip-flop (suddenly having to leave earlier than a few days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, the intensity of the menstruation varies from person to person. Some people bleed for three days, some for a week; some bleed little, some bleed a lot; some do not have any symptoms, some are so painful that they need to be transported by ambulance; the intensity of the menstruation changes over time, what was not painful before does not necessarily mean that it will not be painful in the future.
The menstruation is not able to be controlled, begins to end in a few days, 24 hours of continuous flow of blood that can only be stopped by using a sanitary napkin or a sanitary pad to absorb the blood to prevent it from flowing onto clothes or chairs.
Menstrual cramps are caused by the release of prostaglandin, which is a hormone produced by the prostate gland. During the first few days of the menstrual cycle, the hormone has not yet been released, and therefore does not cause menstrual cramps. However, once the hormone is released, menstrual cramps are caused by the hormone. During the first few days of the menstrual cycle, the hormone has not yet been released, and therefore does not cause menstrual cramps. However, once the hormone is released, menstrual cramps are caused by the hormone. During the first few days of the menstrual cycle, the hormone has not yet been released, and therefore does not cause menstrual cramps. However, once the hormone is released, menstrual cramps are caused by the hormone. During the first few days of the menstrual cycle, the hormone has not yet been released, and therefore does not cause menstrual cramps. However, once the hormone is released, menstrual cramps are caused by the hormone. During the
During the premenstrual period, the uterus is filled with blood and progesterone is released in excess, making it easy to get a stomach ache.
If the period is late, for no apparent reason,, basically within two days, the menstruation will come..
A sanitary napkin should be changed every two to three hours and not more than six times a day. The worst case scenario is changing a sanitary napkin every day for seven days of the month, which amounts to 42 napkins, not including the sanitary napkins prepared in advance.
(This sentence needs to be modified a bit, it is not necessary to change the sanitary napkin every five to six hours, it is enough to change it every eight hours. )
During the menstruation period, the hormone hormone may be more aggressive, the ovulation period may also be affected by the change in hormone levels, the mood is unstable and the body gives itself a hard time..
However, official crime statistics show that women still have a high ability to control their emotions and do not use emotional problems as an excuse.
The flow is not only blood, it includes the shedding of the endometrium.
After the end of the menstruation, the thickness of the endometrium is the thinnest, and it gradually thickens, which can be understood as the uterus is like a house, every month it builds a new house ( the endometrium thickens ) in preparation for welcoming guests, but the guests do not come and the whole thing is dismantled ( the menstrual blood is expelled ) for the next month to build a new house again in a cyclical manner.
The menstrual cycle is very inconvenient, it has been going on for several decades, every month for a few days 24 hours a day flowing blood, it also causes pains in the stomach and in the lower back. No one wants to go through it.
However, a person is able to be born because his mother has had a regular menstrual cycle. Menstruation is for the purpose of preparing the body for the first time to be born into this world. people should thank their mothers for having a regular menstrual cycle.
In the past, many aspects of women's lives were repressed, society brainwashed women into believing that they were dirty and shameful, but the times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is bad, feels that the female body is preparing for the birth of a new life, he should not talk about it in public, the girls stood up and said that they should not think this way, that they have never experienced it, and that they do not know how to treat their male counterparts. They should not have this attitude towards their mothers, they should not have this attitude towards their children.
Lastly, sisters should try using sanitary pads. they are really useful..

The footbath basin is leaking electricity.
Selecting a suitable footbath basin can have a very good effect on foot therapy, and today, the small editor of the People's Republic of China will explain this issue in detail, hoping that it will be helpful to friends.
As people's awareness of their health has increased, the popularity of the footbath basin has grown, and in the market, a large number of products with varying levels of quality have emerged, ranging from 100 to 1000 yuan, giving consumers a wide range of options to choose from.
In terms of related data, compared to traditional household appliances, sales of foot baths and other health related household appliances have been booming, but foot baths do not have a specialized industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk.
" to be immersed in electrically charged water is just too dangerous.. "
Mr. Li told the reporter that he bought a footbath basin as a birthday gift for his father, but when his father bathed his feet, he felt his feet go numb.
At first, Mr. Li thought that it was the vibrations of the footbath that caused the sensation, but he did not think that the vibrations were turned off and his father still felt the sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li used an electric pencil to test it, to his surprise, the electric pencil lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the footbath was electrically charged.
Later, he contacted the merchants, the merchants' attitude was not bad, although he had to give up the foot bath basin, Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied.
Because of this, this ancient footbath basin, which has been in use for a long time, is now set at the highest temperature, and is suitable for all kinds of people, all kinds of materials, and is free of harm, in all aspects, it does not have a clear and detailed industry regulation.
However, in general, the footbath basin does not have an electrical problem, but it is not excluded that a small number of products, when leaving the factory, were not subjected to strict quality control.
As a result, at the time of purchase, it was decided to choose a separate foot bath basin.
The separation of water and electricity has no safety concerns.
At the same time, he can take a test with an electric pencil.

Ding Zi Liang : Letter to a friend.
This person would like to express his sincere gratitude to all his friends and relatives for the assistance they have given him over the past 30-plus years, especially since he made an appeal for humanitarian assistance in his name in 1994.
Nowadays, the vast majority of the victims' old parents have already passed away, the orphans have also grown up and become independent.
It was their generosity that helped them through the most difficult time of their lives..
At present, the new coronavirus epidemic is wreaking havoc all over the world, and most of the donors have already reached the age of retirement.
Therefore, I plead with them to stop giving money to the Tiananmen Square mothers' group, a humanitarian aid activity that has long since run its course.
I will always remember their love and believe that their good deeds will be recorded in history..
Due to various reasons, I can only express his wishes in this way, ask his friends to understand.
I offer his sincere blessing.
Translate this from zh to en:The Taoist Association of the United States (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation (MCDF) have been involved in humanitarian aid for 32 years.
In the process of conducting humanitarian aid, the American Red Cross and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation are two parallel organizations, the project's implementers often have cross--currents.

Assistance funds are often not able to reach the hands of the victims of the June 4th incident..
In 1994, after the suggestion of Mr. Ding, a special committee was established by the "Mothers of Tiananmen Square" to coordinate and supervise the receipt and distribution of relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the " June 4th Orphan Education Fund " and, after 11 years, in 2009, when all of the June 4th orphans had graduated from university, MCDF set up the " June 4th Orphan Aid Fund for the elderly " and has continued to operate to this day.
The funding for these projects comes mainly from donations made in the aftermath of the June 4th incident, from individual donations, and from the support of the Tsinghua University Democratic Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre had not received any compensation for 31 years, until a portion of the money raised in Hong Kong in 1989 under the name of the Tiananmen Square massacre was finally paid out.
During this period, the China Human Rights Defenders also carried out their humanitarian aid project independently.
We understand that Professor Ding's call for a halt to the June 4th donations is for the benefit of the donors, and that they are not as wealthy as they were before retirement. This is also the case for the "thank you letter" that Ding addressed to his " friend " in which he expressed his gratitude.
They will respect the decision of the people of Hong Kong, to end the project within two years, and, if necessary, immediately reinstate it.
For those who, for many years, have consistently donated large sums of money to humanitarian aid, risking their own lives, they should be thanked and respected.

Thanks to bunny's point of view, originally he said that the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style, but he did not expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thanks to the recognition of Bean Bean, his satisfaction is enough to make us full of energy to continue to move forward, they will continue to fuel up.
This photography workshop is really great, it is highly recommended for all small friends to attend..
No matter from reception, make-up, costume, lighting and photography to post--production, there is nothing to criticize..
The make-up artist is very specialized, he is able to put together a make-up suitable for the wearer's style, using make-up products from the first line of major brands..
Tian Liang, the teacher, is not even worth mentioning. photography is a very specialized field..
The entire workshop has an artistic atmosphere, and there are also two small cats playing around..
They are working in Beijing, the best film studios in Beijing need to reserve half a year in advance to line up, a colleague was shooting in Beijing and looked at the finished film and thought it was just so- so.
He specifically sought out this workshop, a place with a soul and a sense of purpose..
Their facial expression management is poor, they feel that this is also the short version of most people, the photographer, bright guy will take pictures and record the natural, brilliant moment..
a makeup artist, a photographer, a post--production designer, a skilled team.
When they came out, everyone around them was praising them to the skies.

From Hohhot to Qinling, the distance between them is thousands of kilometers, but they trust each other so much. I'm very happy to get to know them. If there is a chance, they will still come to Qinling to play.
I want to know how to give money.
The delivered meal has already been delivered.
there was no rider to pick up.
Now the restaurant staff are giving me a phone call.
a programming novice who wants to share his experience.
If one intends to enter this industry, it is possible to choose to go to a place for training. However, if one does not have this intention, it is still better to study on one's own. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it also takes six months to study.
However, for those who are planning to enter this industry, babysitting is a very good choice, especially for those with low self--control and weak people. Babysitting is a very good choice.
If the self--study capacity is strong, it is also possible to study on one's own. However, it is more exhausting..
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, it is necessary to look at the strength of the teaching staff of this training institution. if the strength of the teaching staff is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning at all. Of course, some new training institutions do not have a particularly strong teaching staff.
Secondly, before choosing a tutoring institution, it is advisable to find out about the institution's graduates. After all, only the graduates of the institution know how good or bad the institution is.
Hello, in fact, he himself did not know how to answer this question, because he did not make a certain introduction about his own situation, and the study of this thing and his own situation has a very big relationship.
For example, specialization, age, the language one wants to study, even the city in which one wants to study, all have a connection to the field one wants to work in.
If he is a student and has not yet graduated,, or if he is a computer science graduate who has already graduated,, then if he has enough time,, he should study on his own,, which is the most efficient and cost--effective way., However, the cost of learning is high, and the amount of time spent learning is high., In fact, many offline and online tutoring institutions are very good,, but the cost of learning is high, and the amount of time spent learning is high., It is necessary to study for 3 to 6 months in a concentrated manner.
However, if it is I who says these things, self--study is very convenient. there are a lot of free learning resources available on the Internet, and there are also a lot of tutoring resources available on b-station. if he does not know where to find the resources, he can contact me and obtain free resources, or he can ask for more detailed advice.
There are also a number of classic books that can be combined with video to study in a more comprehensive way..
If the person is not a computer science specialist, but is able to pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, he or she is advised to go to a training institution to study. This way, studying does not require a lot of effort, the lecturer's explanations are very detailed, there is someone to answer questions, and there is also help in terms of study planning or supervision.
In addition, many vocational training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal hiring quotas, and recommend students to companies after they have completed their studies. As a result, the process of finding a job after graduation is also shortened.
The above are some of my views, which were not detailed because he did not know the situation of the other person, so he only gave a general overview. If the other person has other thoughts to discuss, he can contact him at any time to exchange views..
1 point earlier, I had said that I had seen the same thing in all apps.
What is called
I haven't finished saying what I wanted to say yet, and he has done what he wanted to do..
Personally, he accepts all kinds of ( installation, cleaning, maintenance ) of boilers, hot water heaters, purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stove hoods, lighting fixtures, window cleaning, housekeeping services.
Thanks to those who silently gave me a thumbs- up, for the sake of life, they struggle hard to make a living, life is hard but they have to continue.
Life will not punish every effort made by a person, those who like him should follow him, those who silently give him a thumbs up should be thanked.
Life is like this. Others only look at the result, while the individual is able to endure the process. In the face of life, besides being strong, one can only continue. There is no other choice, the road can be turned back to look at, but cannot be turned back to walk. ...
Cleaning is work, it is also a duty, life is beautiful because of service and service is beautiful because of sincerity.
Although the cleaners are doing the dirtiest work, they do it with the most serious attitude, cleaning every nook and cranny of the customer's house until they see the customer's satisfied smile and raised index finger, at that moment, all the exhaustion is worth it, the effort is rewarded..
My daily work.
- - His request, his service.
Serving with heart, cleaning with heart, keeping the beauty.
The details that concern him, the housekeeping services provided by the Beijing Fangcheng family are " clean " as much as he can, to serve the love of the house.
To keep the house clean, to build a family political monument, to serve to perfection, to keep the house clean.
indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work.
A crystal chandelier may be beautiful, but if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will lose its lustre, and only after it has been cleaned can it radiate light. life is also like this.
In order to achieve success, it is necessary to put effort into it. In order to create something fine, it is necessary to pay attention to the details. We are sincere.
Giving him a chance, he will definitely make him satisfied, the quality of the product is a guarantee, because the professional value deserves to be trusted, his recognition is the most encouraging for him.
The current situation in all fields of work is not good at all.
However, I still believe that as long as he is sincere in his attitude, as long as he is determined, as long as he works hard, he will be better than others, at least he will be better than those who sit around and complain. "
One day's fortune depends on the morning, all the good things start from the morning. Hope that he carries happiness, good luck, health and good fortune with him and starts the new day with a good mood. He keeps a good mood throughout the day. Good morning.
As a child, happiness was a thing, possessing it made one happy; as an adult, happiness was a goal, achieving it made one happy; as one matured, one realized that happiness was a state of mind, understanding it made one happy..
To be the most authentic and good--natured version of oneself, to act according to one's heart, without regret for the present life; that there is only one path to follow in life, to follow one's own path; that the two most valuable possessions in life are a healthy body and a good mood, and to live a lively life until old age.
Every stage of a person's life is marked by different challenges..
Often, it is not the lack of ability, but the courage to face it that binds us..
Since we can't avoid it, it is better to face it boldly..
The more afraid he is, the more he will be knocked down by difficulties; the more he dares to face difficulties, problems will eventually be solved..
The China- Saudi Arabia first contemporary art biannual exhibition was held in Saudi Arabia for the first time - Xinhua News Agency
12 December 2012, the New China News Agency reported that the first Contemporary Art Biennale of Saudi Arabia was officially opened to the public on 11 December in the PDIRIyah Art District in the northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries participated in the exhibition.
The 2012 Sharjah Biennial was organized by the Sharjah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China. UCCA Center for Contemporary Art director Yang Feng served as the artistic director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of the 2016/ 2017 biennial exhibition is " crossing the river by touching the stone " , which is a metaphor for the reform strategies taken by the Saudi society during the period of economic and social transition. It also reflects the current situation of Saudi society's cultural development.
This year's double- year exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, spread across six buildings connected to each other in a row, with six single units presenting the following: " Touching the Stone while crossing the river " " Transmission as an experiment " " Thinking on the edge " " Walking towards the public " " A beautiful new world " and " On the Spirit of Art " .
In particular, 27 works by Saudi artists accounted for more than 40 percent of the total number of exhibited works, including paintings, installations and performance art. 12 works by Chinese artists also attracted a lot of attention, some of which used recycled materials in innovative ways, such as in Xu Bing's " Skeleton Mountain " series ( 2014 ) in which he reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Dariyah Biennale Foundation, Barclay, said that he hoped that this biennale would be able to establish an international dialogue and give the global audience the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural industry and creative community and strengthen the exchange of visits.
Tianyu Yun said: "The goal of the biennial exhibition is twofold: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to become part of the contemporary art world. "
It is understood that during the period of the biannual exhibition, a series of lectures will be held, in which artists, curators and leaders of the creative industry will discuss cross--cultural exchange, contemporary art and other themes.

Yunnan : coordinating and standardizing the management of public welfare jobs in the countryside – Xinhua News Agency
The Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 12 December 2019 ( reporter Lin Bifeng ) In order to continue to do a good job in the employment of the poverty-stricken population, to consolidate and expand the achievements of the poverty eradication campaign, the People's Republic of China's Yunnan Province recently issued a policy to promote public service jobs in the countryside. This will help to push forward the comprehensive implementation of rural revitalization.
The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Affairs of Yunnan Province said that at present, Yunnan has developed 4.483 million rural public service jobs, which are used for the relocation of poverty--stricken labor force, among other things, to help the poverty--stricken group to achieve employment and income growth, to consolidate the poverty- -stricken campaign, and to strengthen the public service capacity of rural areas, among other things.
The new regulation was jointly issued by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. It mainly focuses on the scope of recruitment, the management of funds, the development of job positions and the management of job positions.
In terms of job position development, the new regulation clarifies that job positions should be set up according to the principle of " according to the need to set up a job position, to use a job position, to manage a job position, and to control the total number of job positions " " one person, one job position, voluntary public recruitment, unified management " and that the principle of " one person, one job position, voluntary public recruitment, unified management " and " one person, one job position, voluntary public recruitment, unified management " should be applied.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the announcement, the application, the review, the public announcement, the hiring, the pre--job training and the placement on the job..
In addition, the new regulation also clarified the specific duties of the departments in charge of the development of rural public service jobs, the standards for the wage subsidies for rural public service jobs, and the way in which the departments in charge of the development of rural public service jobs should purchase accident insurance for rural public service job placement personnel. It also stipulated that the relevant departments should periodically monitor the distribution of wage subsidies for rural public service jobs.

Although the right wing has had a period of success in history, it has been short--lived, so it is because it gets a little bit of sunshine that it is bright and because it drinks a little bit of water, it sweats; if it has a period of success, it is like a hairless monkey that has nowhere to cling to..
However, in reality, the right wing played a positive role in the process of social progress..
From the end of the era of the Cultural Revolution, defining the true meaning of truth, the development of the economy, the advancement of science and technology, the promotion of the institutionalization of the government and the protection of human rights, among other aspects,, the right--wing's positive meaning should not be denied.
As far as I'm concerned, although I do not agree with some of Lee Wei- Dong's sayings, he is a serious person, he is serious about China, he is serious about China's social problems.
However, he opposes his anti-communist ideology, he believes that a necessary revolution will lead to social turmoil, damage to the people's livelihood, and a mishmash of political parties. Furthermore, foreigners will take advantage of the chaos.
Fourth, to change or improve China, it must have patience and the attitude of being responsible for the country and the people, that is, it must not be a rightist, but a scoundrel.
Talk about it again.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of time and political orphans.
If the right has a positive impact on society, the Communist Party will listen to some rightist rhetoric and analyse their thoughts from time to time. However, the left does not have this advantage, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has discarded..
Recently, I have seen some friends berating the traitors while denouncing the leftists, and doing so in a rather energetic manner. I think this is not necessary..
Talking rationally with Han collaborators and leftists is pointless. they are all the same, there is no rational argument to be made with them..
Also, they shouldn't try to prove that they are right, and they shouldn't try to make the other side admit that they are wrong.
This is what he told his friends: when the counterfeiters insulted him with five cents, when the leftists insulted him with the right-wingers, it proved that the middle path is the right one.
Many young people also had ideals when they were young, but when they grew old, they forgot their ideals, or they pursued their ideals, but they became fanatics.
And the ideal and the ideal become more and more distant, even a young dragon eventually becomes an evil dragon..
Left and right, in general, refers to constraints and freedom. China, from its historical and cultural heritage, has a genetic predisposition to be more left--leaning. as a whole.
However, in China, the right--wing focuses on efficiency and development, while the left- wing focuses on fairness and safety.
In the present day, society as a whole wants more emphasis on fairness, while at the same time China and the United States are competing with each other, and the tendency to the left is certain. it is likely to continue for many years.
Although he does not understand, he will still give a thumbs up.
I don't want to talk about it anymore, Flower Flower is just like that.
In the past two years, the US embargo on Huawei's computer chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament,, but also caused huge losses for "American" companies.
The US Empire is putting pressure on China's semiconductor industry, demanding that its own businesses and allied countries' businesses conduct a blockade of the Chinese semiconductor industry at the same time. The direct consequence of this is that the supply of semiconductors from global suppliers is affected, which in turn affects the research and development investment and production capacity of semiconductor manufacturing companies, which in turn causes a shortage of semiconductors in the global supply chain.
The shortage of semiconductors now affects all major industries around the world, including the suspension of production by car manufacturers and the increase in the price of mobile phones. almost all industries that use semiconductors have been affected.
In order to gain " chip " self--sufficiency, more and more countries' science and technology giants have started to follow the " de- Americanization " path.
In order to firmly control the world's semiconductor industry, the United States has been conducting a series of actions recently, including hosting a semiconductor summit, inviting 64 countries to form a semiconductor alliance, and providing financial support to US--based semiconductor technology giants, such as Intel, the United States' oldest semiconductor technology giant, which has invested US$200 million to build two semiconductor wafer fabrication plants in the US state of Arizona.
When most people thought that Intel's move would cause TSMC to suffer a certain blow and that it would steal TSMC's " bowl of rice. "
The reason why they are so confident is because Intel, as the elder statesman of American technology, has been cultivating the field of semiconductors for several decades and has a large number of talented personnel and technological reserves, which means that it will be able to quickly rise to the top and defeat TSMC in a short period of time.
However, in the case of Intel's decision, the founder of TSMC, Zhang Zhiyong, does not take it into consideration.
During the " 2021 Great Master Intellectual Forum " held in April this year,, Zhang Zhongzhou's language was shocking. He said that the decision by Intel to build a semiconductor wafer fabrication plant was a blatant insult.
The reason why Zhang Zhongguo is so opposed to Intel entering the semiconductor wafer sector is because he still holds a grudge against the 30- year old dispute between Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel of the American manufacturing industry, the undisputed world leader in the field of semiconductors.
In the 1980s, the world's high--end semiconductor chips were in the hands of a small number of strong players.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, in which the chip went from design to fabrication to testing in one factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this way of doing business made some small businesses unable to bear the burden of heavy production costs, and many semiconductor start-up entrepreneurs, faced with the enormous cost of building a production line, could only look on helplessly.
Driven by market demand, after the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to see the phenomenon of division of labor cooperation. In 1984, after hearing that there was a company that specialized in chip design,, Zhang Zhuzhong thought that since there was a company that specialized in chip design, it would be possible to establish a factory that specialized in manufacturing wafers.
Sometime later, Zhang Zhiqing's idea became a reality with the founding of TSMC.
TSMC focuses its main business on " wafer fabrication " this single stage of the process, without engaging in design, only providing wafer fabrication as a contract manufacturing service.
At that time, the newly established TSMC faced Intel, a giant in the field,, and it was just a small fry..
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhiqing once tried to attract Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC only manufactured semiconductor chips, had a high opinion of itself and looked down on TSMC, it firmly refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhuoji also said that Intel at the time looked down on the wafer manufacturing process service.
It was not expected that the giant of the semiconductor wafer manufacturing service would look down on it, but now it also has to start doing semiconductor wafer manufacturing..
Therefore,, Zhang Zhiqing felt that it was very ironic for Intel to enter the wafer fabrication outsourcing.
In the meantime, the market value of TSMC has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of TSMC's strong offensive, Intel, of course, is not able to stand still.
In the meantime, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) has already moved on to 3 nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14 nm.
It is not easy to overtake.
I've been waiting for this for a long time.
By 19:06, 2 hours had passed since the first order was placed. 😅
Taking a look at some of today's hottest topics.
what is normal public opinion.
Select three hot searches at random: the rise of the two-- headed dragon, the increase in the price of good friends, and the Pang La La incident. a wave of public opinion was created, and then the index fell ( a smooth curve line ) and finally dissipated. if a second wave of public opinion is created, a small peak will appear again.
They look identical to the ones shown on the official website of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the
what is the abnormality of public opinion.
Randomly selecting six of the same event's "hot search"s, they show "isolated peak "s, " sawtooth "s and " cliff "s.
【isolated peak state 】 is the result of man-made heating, a rapid ascent to the top of the hot search list; 【 serrated peak state 】 is the result of periodic heating, ensuring that the hot search list is dominated by the topic; 【 cliff state 】 is the result of collective withdrawal, when the hot search list has fulfilled its function and is ready to move on to a new battlefield.
In event 9, the peak of one event's heat wave coincides exactly with the trough of another event's heat wave, and the time difference is only a few seconds, which means that the same batch of water troops received the task and launched a new round of assault.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen clearly: dozens of hot searches at the same time made it to the top of the rankings, some of which attract attention, some of which are responsible for science popularization, some of which generate war propaganda, some of which divert attention, some of which influence perceptions, some of which mislead judgments, some of which incite emotions, some of which sway decisions, black public relations accounts are divided into batches and divided into phases of the campaign, almost taking into account all of the factors involved in the dissemination of public opinion.
Propaganda is a science, ignoring all subjective factors and basing itself only on objective data, even black public relations would have no place to hide..
Everyone who has passed by has left their mark, and it is these marks that we have unearthed together.
The data comes from the hot search time machine.
Mauritius and other countries have discovered the first case of infection with the Omicron virus strain - Xinhua News Agency
Maldives, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported their first cases of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant on 10 December.
According to Maldives Health Minister Kishore Pate, a person infected with the disease left South Africa on November 27 and arrived in the Maldives as a tourist. Another person infected with the disease was a resident of the Maldives who had been in contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and then returned to the Maldives. He tested positive for the disease on November 30.
After treatment in isolation wards of the hospital, the two infected persons' nucleic acid test results turned out to be negative, and they have since returned to their respective places of residence.
On the 10th day of the month, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Cyprus announced the first confirmation of three cases of the Omicron variant in the country.
All three of them are students, they returned to the country from overseas travel in the beginning of this month and were diagnosed with mild illnesses, so they did not enter the hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Senegalese government has increased the strength of the anti- epidemic effort.
From 6 December 2019 to 10 January 2020, passengers aged 12 years and above entering the country by air were required to undergo a nucleic acid test at the airport at their own expense.
The Serbian Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it would begin vaccinating the country's 5 to 11-year old children with the H1N1 vaccine produced by Pirey.
On the 9th of September, Malawi's Health Minister Kwaneen Chicchom said that the country had discovered its first three cases of the Omicron strain of the HIV virus.
The country's health department conducted genetic sequencing of 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected between November 9 and December 2 and discovered these three cases of infection.

The big beauty 360 integrated house furnishings
Address: No. 156 on the South side of the Inner Ring Road and No. 12 on the 12th floor of the Happiness Family Garden.
At the beginning, a friend introduced him because of trust, so he chose to come to look at it initially his budget was 7 million to do a basic renovation.
When he arrived at the shop, he started a series of fraudulent tricks.
He came to the shop for the first time only to give them a look at his house plan. they did not go to the site to measure the house, yet they were able to give him a price of 7 million saying that his 135 square meter house could be finished for 7 million. They also gave him a look at their materials, but they did not know what kind of materials they were using.
Their second trick is that if you go to the shop, they will drag him to pay the deposit (and this money is never refunded, unless he has enough experience and is able to negotiate with them).
At the time of deciding whether or not to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to come and tell him that if he paid the deposit today, they would give him a certain amount of discount.
This is a big pit, and I'm just an example of being conned. I paid a deposit of 100,000 yuan in a moment of impulsiveness.
He gave me a price of 7 million, which did not include water and electricity renovations, did not include any doors or kitchen cabinets, and did not include the cost of bathroom renovations, which are the big ticket items.
In addition to this, their service point fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost confidence in this company from the very beginning, nothing was explained clearly and he made me sign a contract..
When I went to get his money back, they acted as if they had a lot of experience, as if they had a special small group of people to deal with him.
whichever way they look at it, the customer is always right is the client's problem and they are completely innocent..
There are various forms of shifting the blame, as well as a lot of minor details that I don't want to list one by one. All in all, we shouldn't choose them because a friend of mine hired them to renovate a house and the quality of the work was poor, and they demanded a lot of additional fees afterwards.
Cave--in, they are the original dragon head decorations, now they have been changed to become big and beautiful, just like they have been shut down again and have been changed to become other ones..
Therefore, everyone should not choose this kind of deceitful construction company.
In the future, when people are choosing, they should look at these and check them out because renovation is not a small amount of money.
If they want to ask the merchants questions, they should first log in or register.
It is forbidden to publish all forms of commercial establishments' ratings, which are detailed in the commercial establishments' recording declaration.

The starry sky has about 14 days of double- headed constellation meteor shower - Xinhua News Agency
The New China News Agency, Tianjin, 12 December 2012 ( reporter Zhou Rui Jin ) Astronomy popularization expert said that as the last major meteor shower of 2012, the North Hemisphere's third major meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower would peak on 14 December. People interested in meteor showers could observe the meteor shower on the night of 14 December.
In 2018, Beijing city amateur astronomer An Kun photographed a meteor shower in the constellation of Gemini on December 13 in the province of Qinghai.
The vast majority of the parent bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Double- Nymph meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apophis- type asteroid.
The Taurus meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not caused by a comet.
The Tianjin Astronomical Society vice president and astronomy popularization specialist Liu Xiangping said that just like a big meteor shower, the meteor shower of the Gemini constellation usually appears at the end of the year, and the " screening period " can last from December 4 to December 17.
This flow of meteors is characterized by its large flow rate and stability, along with the flow of meteors from the constellation of the Northern Hemisphere and the constellation of the Southern Hemisphere. Together with the Northern Hemisphere flow of meteors from the constellation of the Northern Hemisphere and the constellation of the Southern Hemisphere, it is known as the three major flow of meteors in the Northern Hemisphere.
One of the distinctive features of the Taurid meteor shower is the relatively slow speed of the meteoroids, the rich variety of colors, and the relatively large number of fireballs. This shower is suitable for both amateur astronomy and amateur astronomy photography.
Tianjin city amateur astronomer Yang Geng on December 13, 2020 photographed the meteor shower of the Gemini constellation in Tianjin county.
The astronomical forecast predicts that this year's Geminid meteor shower will peak at 150 meteors per hour at 15:00 local time on December 14.
a flow of meteors from the constellation of Gemini.
Last year' s " Pleiades meteor shower " gave people a deep impression, but this year ' s " Pleiades meteor shower " will be affected by the moon ' s light interference, the intensity of the shower will be reduced.
On the 14th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, the lunar month is in surplus, the moon is bright and the moonlight can cause interference in the observation. however, after midnight, the moon will fall down and the flow of stars in the constellation of Gemini will rise high. at this time, the radiation point of the Gemini star shower will also rise high.
Friends who like to watch meteor showers can observe them in the last half of the night after the moon has set, but they should take care to protect themselves from the cold and stay warm. "
How to be able to observe as many shooting stars as possible.
"It is not advisable to carry out observations in the city, but it is possible to do so in the outskirts or in the countryside, by choosing a high- altitude site with little light pollution, facing east-northeast, and waiting patiently for the moon to set, after which observations can be made with the naked eye.
It is important to note that the flow rate of the double-- star constellation's meteor shower is very high in all directions, so it is not necessary to keep staring at the double- star constellation's meteor shower's radiant point during observation.
Photographers who like to take pictures of shooting stars should try to take pictures of the " shooting star rain " with a wide- angle lens and a large aperture. They should use high ISO and the largest aperture during the shooting.
Based on stability and continuity considerations, the three-- legged tripod, the standby battery and the fast shutter cable are also indispensable. "
Moderator Zhu said.
The difference between laser television and traditional television in terms of market positioning.
According to the author's understanding, the term "traditional television" refers to the liquid crystal television. On the other hand, the difference between the mega laser television and the liquid crystal television in terms of market positioning is mainly due to the following two points.
The first is that the laser television is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the all--encompassing market positioning of the liquid crystal television, the laser television is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or the laser television itself was created for the large screen market.
At present, the mainstream size of liquid crystal televisions is between 55 and 65 inches, while the size of laser televisions is generally between 75 and 100 inches, and some are even larger than 100 inches, fully meeting the demand for large screen color televisions..
In recent years, the outgoing volume and sales volume of laser TVs worldwide have increased continuously, and in the total television sales volume of 80 inches and above, their share is more than 60%..
According to a forecast by the company, the sales volume of laser TVs in 2020 would increase by more than 140 percent, continuing to maintain a high rate of growth.
The reason for its success in the large screen market is due to its outstanding performance in the field of protecting the eyes.
Based on the principle of mirage television, the mirage television uses a laser light source that does not directly hit the eyeball, as opposed to the backlight source of the liquid crystal television. The process of creating an image is more similar to natural conditions than the process of creating an image in a liquid crystal television, and it causes less eye strain.
The China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute's Sai Xi laboratory and the Beijing Union Hospital's Ophthalmology Department conducted a strict comparison test between a laser television and a liquid crystal television under the same conditions on a group of people. 144 sets of test data were obtained.
The data confirms that laser TVs have a very strong protective eye feature, in some respects even having a certain improvement effect.
With the increasing attention given to eye health in the present day, laser TVs, which have the advantage of protecting the eyes, have attracted more and more users, and have also opened up a new market for colour television.
The second is that the laser television is more focused on the high--end market.
Unlike the price of liquid crystal televisions, the price of mega- laser televisions has continued to fall. Currently, the price of mega- laser televisions sold in the market is mostly more than RMB 100,000, and as the size and light source are upgraded, the price continues to rise.
The reason why the price of laser television is so high is because of the laser.
There must be something to it..
With the development of light source and technology, the mega laser television has many advantages over liquid crystal television and projection television that cannot be achieved.
thanks to the super short projection distance of the laser television, the projection distance of the laser television is relatively short compared to traditional projection equipment, it can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance of 100 inches, and the space required is small, and the main machine is small and compact, it takes up very little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach 2000 lumens or more.
In addition, the heat output is lower, resulting in less wear and tear on the equipment, extending the lifespan of the television.
In addition to this, many high--end laser television sets also feature 4K ultra high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, biomimetic screens, and other cutting-edge technologies, which will give viewers a more powerful visual and auditory experience.
It is not a fake demand, but rather a demand for a product that is divided by the quality of the picture and the ratio of output to input. the laser television does not appeal to film and television players because it does not meet the requirements of a large screen and a viewing environment. It is possible to try it out, but there are advantages and disadvantages to be weighed, and it is up to the individual to judge for themselves.
In simple terms, the ultra- wide- angle near focus laser television projector - the laser television projector with the most expensive ultra- wide- angle lens and reflector lens, which does not comply with the best optical design.
In order to filter out some of the ambient light, a micro-structured phospholipid screen was used, at a high cost, the price of 80 inches is basically able to replace a 65 inch liquid crystal screen..
There is also one thing that I particularly dislike about the projection equipment manufacturer's use of the matt reflective surface as a selling point: the light that hits the screen from the matt reflective surface is the same as the light that hits the screen from the matt reflective surface. The light that hits the screen from the matt reflective surface on the ceiling is the same as the light that hits the screen from the matt reflective surface on the ceiling. The light that hits the screen from the matt reflective surface on the ceiling is the same as the light that hits the screen from the matt reflective surface on the ceiling. The light that hits the screen from the matt reflective surface on the ceiling is the same as the light that hits the screen from the matt reflective surface on the ceiling. The light that hits the screen from the matt reflective surface on the ceiling is the same as the light that hits the screen from the matt reflective surface on the ceiling. The light that hits the screen from the matt reflective surface on the ceiling is the same as the light that hits the screen from the matt reflective surface on the ce
More importantly, a projection screen without a matt finish will not produce an image..
The high gain screen's hot spot ( light spot ) effect was overlooked, at a certain angle, a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes, and that is really uncomfortable.
The visual aesthetics of photography museum, the best quality store, a temporary one that does not have a branch.
She added the date of the reservation to WeChat, and then sent the time that could be chosen to me. the response was quicker than usual.
Previously, he went to the studio to look at the shooting works, more of which were outdoor wedding gowns. The shooting was very beautiful and the shooting style was very diverse.
On the same day, he arrived and had a brief conversation with the little lady about his own ideas. he was very patient and helped him try on two sets of clothes that he was unsure about, and finally decided to start the makeup and hairstyling. Before the shoot, the photographer would set up some props, give instructions, and pay attention to many details.
However, it is possible that because he did not communicate with me in detail about the filming style he wanted, he ended up filming something that was not what he wanted,, but that was still good to look at. 🙊 🙊
After the shoot is over, the photographer will help choose the photos, discuss the post--production style, the photographer seemed to be very attentive..
A finished film takes about half a month to be ready, waiting for the effect.
the second time he hit the photo shoot lunch, a large part of the clothes in the room were able to choose one piece of clothing to be photographed..
In the end, she chose a black chiffon dress, to experience different styles.
The entire filming process took about two hours, including makeup and filming. The filming director, a 95er, was the nephew of the photographer. he was a little shy, but he was quite talkative. During the filming process, he gave a lot of advice.
The visual arts museum of photography, the photography gallery of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality store, the store of the best quality
It is now on the first page, so it is time to see Queenie as well..
He first filled in his name, telephone number, then chose the type of clothing and the wedding dress. He changed three or four sets of clothing, but he was very patient. After choosing, he did his makeup for a long time, and the service attitude was also good. After that, he taught him how to pose and how to pose. The photos that came out were that his face looked big, the makeup artist said that it would take half a month, but three or four days later, the photos were sent. It seemed that there was no difference from the original film.
The overall situation is still good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are three possible positions for make-up: in the middle of the room, in front of the photographer's studio, and in front of the photographer's studio in the middle of the room.
They are very enthusiastic and also very attentive.
The hairstylist was very patient..
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching him the movements.
If the photographer is not satisfied, he will ask for a retake.
【 experience ] the makeup may have gone too far, the original double eyelid was plastered with three eyelids..
The eyebrows were also shaved, for those who do not paint their eyebrows on a daily basis, it is a bit awkward.
The pictures were sent to him about 10 days ago, but he was not satisfied with the photo effect. He said that the double eyelid surgery was still very obvious.
Because he wasn't sure what kind of style he wanted, he tried two sets. He went back and forth until he finally chose a black suit. The little lady said that this set was more in line with the revival of the old-fashioned style.
After choosing the clothes, the makeup and hair styling began. The hairstylist and the makeup artist were very patient in helping her with her makeup and hair styling. she was very satisfied with the final effect.
After the make-up was done, the photographer started taking pictures. the photographer guided her throughout the shoot. it was a very pleasant and harmonious process.
After the shoot, he carefully selected four photos that he liked the most for post--production. he said that the film was 15 minutes long and that he was very satisfied with the ending.
Already three days have passed without a response. because their system cannot recognise his credit card, he cannot join the #PRS - Org # plus monthly fee scheme.
The most bizarre thing is that he uses the same credit card every time he makes a payment.
I have to pay the transportation fee every time.
They can first exempt me from paying the monthly fee, until they have finished their investigation,, and then collect the fee., right.
A small umbrella to buy insurance is not a good idea.
A small umbrella is an internet- based insurance agent recruitment platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions, according to the 2015 amendment of the regulation on the supervision of insurance agency companies,, in order to become an insurance agency company, three key words must be met: the shareholders, the founders must have no major violations of the law in the past three years, and the minimum amount of capital must be 500 million yuan. In addition, the approval of the Ministry of Public Security must be obtained.
These three clauses are actually very strict, when summarized, they are to have real power, to have passed through the approval of the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security
In this respect, it is not bad, it is worth trusting.
From the point of view of the insurance product, the small umbrella insurance is a supermarket for insurance products. Many of the company's star disability insurance products are sold on this platform,, such as the recently launched and Tay super- Mary 5th disability insurance, the reinsurance company and the underwriting company are both Tay People's Life Insurance. The small umbrella insurance is only a third party intermediary, so there is no reason to doubt its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment model,, the Internet platform's product, because of the lack of the cost of running the business at the point of sale, and the salary of the businessmen, the cost--benefit ratio of the Internet platform's product is high, and the payment method is flexible, it allows for monthly payments, which reduces the pressure on the person paying the fees, and at the same time maximizes the use of the leverage of the insurance.
This point is still very good..
it can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the business staff, this point is particularly important, because the insurance industry is an industry that requires a very high level of professionalism. As a result, many Internet-based products can be self--insured by the customer, which means that there are a lot of misconceptions in the area of health declaration and occupational safety. In the area of health declaration and occupational safety, non- insurance professionals tend to believe that they are healthy or fit for the job, which means that there is a high risk of being denied compensation.
He himself used to work as a telephone salesman for "Tengteng micro-protection" (which is also an internet- based insurance agent recruitment agency) and he was very responsible in telling people about the importance of insurance.
The Internet's insurance is genuine and trustworthy, but people are not. The Internet's channel does not have any professional from the industry, and it also has a lot of salespeople who mislead.
For example, 1 yuan of insurance protects 60 million, buy insurance and get a mobile phone for free, receive 6 million yuan of redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable re
For 1 pound, the insurance company will pay 60 million ( the world is falling apart ) .
Free handover of the mobile phone, is the free handover of the mobile phone to the mobile phone with a special number plate, such as 6666, 8888, for example, and if the winning short message is sent out, the mobile phone is not exchanged and no one is reminded of it.
(for the person who applies for protection, this is another pitfall ) free to get 6 million ringgit in redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable redeemable
Currently, the government is also cracking down on the misleading advertising of Internet insurance sales.
Therefore, the platform itself is not a problem, the product itself is not a problem, the problem is the lack of professionalism and professional ethics on the part of the businessmen.
It is suggested that the title of the essay should be examined carefully, in fact, many offline insurance agency companies have a broader range of products, the customers can choose from, and some of the products have a better price- performance ratio than the Internet products.
He himself has assisted 59 Internet customers in securing line--down products, saving 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per person per year.
If there are any doubts among the audience, they are welcome to talk to him.
Mingyu, an insurance agent, has three years of experience in business management training, has served nearly a thousand businesses, has cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, before the signing of a contract, he will take the needs of the customer as a starting point and will customize the insurance product for the customer, during the signing of the contract, he will compare three insurance companies in order to get the best result for the customer, after the signing of the contract, he will organize the insurance certificates, take care of the certificates and make the customer feel at ease.
to accompany each customer in their lifelong development.
I hope that his answer can help the original questioner.
According to the definition of the insurance supervisory department,, the Internet insurance is the insurance business in which the person who clicks on the insurance link can complete all the insurance procedures on his own.
In this process, the mover does not need to sign anything and the insurance advisor does not need to sign anything. All steps can be completed by the mover alone.
Although the online insurance contract does not have much " ritualistic " feel, it may even not have a printed paper version of the contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is similar to that of "telephone sales" in general, but it has a fatal flaw that is similar to that of buying insurance in this manner, which is that the follow--up service may not be up to par.
Insurance is usually a long--term contract that lasts for several decades, and when one buys insurance, he or she should seriously think about choosing a "protector" that is able to accompany him or her for a long period of time, and is also able to provide him or her with services in many years to come.

Replacing the discount code would be enough.
There is no problem, he remembers that he has already bought another one and does not want to waste it.
Thank you for helping him.
From the past to the present, he has always opposed any form of defamation and slander, and he cannot accept this type of attack on his person.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but they must be banned..
If we don't take into account political parties and factional groupings, the first thing that needs to be resisted is this kind of uncivilised behaviour.
From the time he started sending Facebook friend requests to begin with, he went on to publish provocative posts, after which he tried to publish the alleged location of his house and his father's name on social media, which he did not respond to.
Latterly, he has become more and more aggressive in tagging me, not only on a daily basis for six meals, but also on Facebook and with his so--called friends, where he continues to discuss about me in a secretive and humiliating manner, such as his appearance, figure, lifestyle, whether or not to have sex, and so on. I have had enough. ...
Latterly, however, more friends sent me pictures of his Facebook profile, where he had posted a picture of himself and had written sexually suggestive remarks.
As a woman, I can no longer remain silent..
When the news of his arrest was reported, he did not back down at all, on the contrary, he became even more aggressive.
I don't care who he is or what his political background is, I don't care what his social status is, in our society, respect for both sexes is needed.
Yes, they can continue with this kind of rhetoric, they can continue with their jokes, they can continue with their insults, they can continue with their harassment, they can continue to think that it is not harassment, and they can continue to deny that it is their creation.
There's no way I can stop them, and I don't have the power to stop them.
I don't know him, and he doesn't want to know him, and his appearance and build are not suitable for him to judge him..
I don't even think that any female student would be willing to allow herself to be so humiliated in order to gain fame..
A friend asked him how he was doing.
I say good, he won't either..
I don't think there is a single female student who would be able to say that she is doing well after being subjected to such harassment..
Whether in the workplace, in society, in the political arena or in the business world, only those who have no basic sense of decency will choose to use this method to hurt any woman.
I believe that public opinion is in the hearts of the people.
I translated part of the comments for the public to judge.
It is unlikely that anyone can impersonate him now that he has posted his own post.
I can only say that he is the public enemy of civilization.
a hearty laugh.
Vietnam People's Newspaper - Vietnam Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Minh attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum.
During the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held on the themes of digital technology enterprises and national digitalization transformation, digital technology enterprises and the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic and post- epidemic economic recovery and development.
The Minister of Information and Communications, Nguyen Xuan Thang, said that in 2021, despite the continuing spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, the number of digital technology companies in Vietnam and their revenue increased by nearly 10 percent.
In 2021, the number of typical Vietnamese digital products increased, solving many of Vietnam's major problems, and many digital products have left the country. Vietnam's ranking in the field of digital technology has improved.
The Secretary of the Ministry of Information and Communications, Nguyen Búi Thieu called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for the development of the country's digitalization turnover platform. The task of developing the country's digital turnover platform is to fulfill the country's mission.
At the forum, the leaders of the various departments and government agencies discussed the research, development, application, and transfer of digital technology among enterprises, organizations, and individuals, and shared their efforts to mobilize and gather the resources of the entire society to develop Vietnamese technology companies, to work together to push the country's digitalization transition, and to come up with breakthrough ideas and solutions to deal with the aftermath of the AIDS epidemic, the post--war economic recovery, and other issues.

The digital transformation needs to participate in the preservation and propagation of the country's cultural values, its historical traditions, its national folk culture and so on, as well as the establishment of a database for these areas. It also needs to push forward the digital transformation of the banking, taxation, land management and development sectors, as well as the transportation sector.
The most important goal of the digital transformation is to make the people happier and to make the country more prosperous.
Primer Minister Fan Ming urged all levels of government, all government agencies and all enterprises to increase the leadership and supervising power in the development of digital technology, to increase their awareness of the transition to digital technology, to continue to draft and complete the regulations on the transition to digital technology, to strengthen the national management and to promote the development of digital technology enterprises with the spirit of respect, dialogue, listening and being proactive and active.

Talking to a friend about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock value and the loss of 2.510 billion dollars in market value, Zuckerberg responded " facing unprecedented competition. "
Meta (formerly Facebook) is a advertising company, its main source of income comes from advertising, and nowadays, advertising companies that have their own flow of traffic.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and others, regardless of their function, are Meta's flow of traffic channel.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest " advertising alliance ", with many apps outsourcing their advertising to Meta's advertising platform and earning money through it.
However, the times have changed.
Firstly, because of the change in the privacy policy of Apple, Meta is no longer able to obtain user data, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
The current privacy policy of Apple is very friendly to the user, it clearly indicates to the user whether or not an app is allowed to obtain information about the user, and most people's normal reaction is to say no.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
The second reason is that Meta's revenue growth in China also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
In everyday life, everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not correct..
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing business overseas.
Meta's office in Hong Kong has about 300 people, in mainland China there are several large agents.
Chinese companies want to expand their markets overseas, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be circumvented. Most of the money is spent on Meta..
Interestingly, TT nowadays is one of Meta's main competitors, but two years ago, Meta made a lot of money from TT.
All the domestic agents are helping Zenith to advertise in Meta's headquarters, and Zenith's business in the Greater China region is also doing very well.
Lately, he has not specifically studied it, but it is certain that it will not be as good as before.
The stage of large--scale burning of money by Chinese companies abroad has already passed.
The third is that the expansion of the new flow channel has not gone smoothly.
Facebook has become increasingly old, new platforms such as TT are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in current income, but also in future prospects.
It is obvious that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zack Braff talked about " the metaverse ".
The concept of the " metaverse " should be one of the future directions, but the implementation period of the " metaverse " is quite long, and the story of the " metaverse " in the last two or three years is not enough to support the market value of Meta.
So, in the next two years, it should be a difficult period for Meta..
Despite the fact that Facebook is now making a lot of money and has an annual income of between 1 billion and 2 billion dollars, the company is actually in a very precarious situation. Compared to other internet companies and high--tech companies, it does not have any good safeguards.
Although his several social networking softwares now have a higher number of daily active users than other social networking softwares, they are mainstream social networking softwares, such as Facebook, Whatsapp, etc., but in the face of TikTok's rapid development, Facebook has no confidence and is being overthrown by it. it is just a matter of a blink of an eye..
However, the idea of creating a virtual world, the so-called " metaverse " that is both possible and unattainable in the short term, makes Facebook very dangerous. This is also the reason why Zuckerberg has changed the name of his company several times and is constantly searching for a new race track. However, he chose the wrong race track, in my opinion.
