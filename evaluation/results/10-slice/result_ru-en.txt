In my opinion, the programme for literature was formed by women of Balzac's age on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, they preferred Danilevsky and Wolkonsky.
They wrote belletristic works, of course, from the point of view of those same mature women of Balzac's era.
Whilst psychology and suffering of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgeniev are not so interesting for teenagers..
Adolescents, in general, are not interested in the psychology of the heroes..
Thanks a lot, it was very interesting..

Also, the mattress has an extended warranty period.
The official guarantee period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in practice the lifespan of the mattress is longer.
The protection against dust and dirt is provided by the removable jacket of jacquard, supplied in the set..
A pair of orthopaedic pillows should be purchased to accompany the orthopaedic mattress – they are recommended to maintain the optimum position of the spine while sleeping..
The filler determines the purpose of the other side – coconut serves as anatomical support for the spine, latex relaxes muscles.

With horror, he remembers these drunken parties and guests in his parents' house.
Guests are at the door, and the potatoes are still being fried on the stove, while the exhausted mother finishes cleaning the floor.
O God, let him sit at the table exhausted.
And then the dishes were washed, the house was cleaned.
In the week before the holiday, food is brought in, two days are spent preparing food and a day is spent cleaning up afterwards..
And the guests what.
They are doing well, they also have a birthday cake with them..
Since then, he does not like holidays and guests.
Even for his family, he covers the table with the minimum.

GERmany - The fourth vaccination against the coronavirus is unavoidable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany is not final, and will continue with new force.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, it is unlikely that two or three doses of vaccine against the coronavirus will be enough for full protection.
According to the head of the Association of general practitioners, Ulrich Weygeldt,, he is convinced of this.
On Saturday, 11 December, Die Welt reported.
The fourth vaccination is expected to be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn, according to the expert.
In addition, Weygeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus can be carried out "in conjunction with vaccination against influenza.
This helps to achieve the best results.
In addition, intensified vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus " Omicron ".
In particular, the new variant is particularly dangerous..
This means that the risk of re-infection with the " Omicron " strain is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer planned to provide the vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new " Omicron " variant of the coronavirus.
The study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that the effectiveness of the two doses of the vaccine was significantly lower: "neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain, said BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
The experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger advocates for shortening the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, as Salzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both delta and omicron variants of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel is very convincing in this regard, " - the expert emphasized.
Pontoon 21 Vib, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21®.
She (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally designed for use in underwater fishing, and not just for trolling.
Theses vibes have a greater weight than those of similar--sized relatives, which undoubtedly has a positive impact on the use of these interesting lures..
Another recognizable feature is the upper paddle, made of strong and flexible plastic, which creates additional vibrations during vertical and horizontal casts.
As a " winter vibrator ", the Bet- A- Vib exhibits a fairly aggressive game.
Often, the most effective animation is the simple monotonous animation, i.e. the movement of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very great, which is convenient for fishing in limited space, overgrown with underwater vegetation, logs and other obstacles, behind which it is possible to become entangled.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when fishing winter pike and large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when precise and aggressive presentation of the bait is required.
Reaching the extreme point of its trajectory, Bet- A Vib immediately turns around and returns to its original vertical position.
Bet- A Vib is also used with success in winter fishing for lake trout in ponds.
In order to satisfy her whims, two modifications are available, one with a noise cancelling capsule (NS - Nano Sound) and one without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet- A Vib game is capable of attracting passive pike, which do not react even to live bait.
Bet-A- Vib shows distance and accuracy when fished in the drift.
This wobbler is easy to understand and not fussy, it combines well with both monofilament and braided lines of even large diameters..
For in-line fishing for perch, pike, eel or trout, in addition to the even trolling, the " staircase " and sometimes " chirping " on the bottom are effective.
When fishing in congested areas, it is possible to change the front triple hook to a double hook, which reduces the risk of entanglement.
Among the lures of its class, Bet- A- Vib is one of the most durable and as a result, one of the most effective.
It can be used with equal success on relatively shallow, as well as on relatively deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, it was announced that there were 7,000 Russian mercenaries.
In Libya there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagners.
This was announced by the chairman of the Supreme State Council of the republic, Khalid al--Mishri on Sunday, December 12.

They also have planes..
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet fighters at the Ghardabia airbase ( which is also used as a civilian airport in Sirte ) , " he said, as quoted by the Anadolu Agency.
Haleed al--Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries " are trying to take over the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after bringing their man to power in the Central African Republic.
Presence
According to the publication's source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in Northern Africa and " settled in Libya.
"Vagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, noted in the publication of the agency.
Russian authorities officially deny that the ChVK "Vagner" receives support from the Kremlin.
Where else there may be mercenaries
According to the agency, "Vagner" operates in nine African countries - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, the company's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the exploitation of useful minerals and natural resources, as well as for the delivery of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries, the article states.
According to the media, " Wagnerites " allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in any military or security agency, it is not listed in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not listed in the personnel rosters..
This company is under US sanctions.
Recall that the ambassadors of 27 countries of the European Union approved sanctions against " Wagner".
This decision is expected to be approved by the European Union Council on 13 December.
Situation in Libya
The de facto Higher State Council of Libya is the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions dominated by Islamists, writes Tass.
This organ repeatedly called for the postponement of the unified day of voting for the election of deputies to the parliament and heads of state from 24 December at least until February 2022.
With less than two weeks left before the elections, the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing, the article states.
In this context, the Higher Electoral Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, as reported by Sky News Arabia television channel.

" Examples of success - " in Syria they defended and restored peace there, " the decision on " Nord Stream 2 " , " the whole world was frightened by the powerful weapons, " " Crimea was annexed. "
The main failures were " the conflict with Ukraine, " the confrontation with Western countries, " and isolation from the world, " according to the study of the Foundation for Public Opinion.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper-work – all government services are now only digital.
The government of Dubai announced a full rejection of paper-work and a transition to digital technologies.
All state services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.

Production and exports of Turkish cars fell below the level of 2020.
The production and export of Turkish automobiles fell sharply in November due to the devaluation of the Turkish lira.
According to Bloomberg,, after 11 months, the industry's results were worse than the previous year's, citing data from the Turkish Association of Automobile Producers.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were manufactured in Turkey, 20 percent less than the previous year.
Approximately 75,9,000 machines were exported, more than 25 percent less than the previous year's record.
And if the automotive sector of Turkey demonstrated a positive trend in the first 10 months of the year, the production of automobiles in the 11 months of 2021 was 0.3% worse than the previous year's figure.
The reason for such a fall was a sharp decline in the Turkish lira's exchange rate, which fell by 29% in relation to the dollar in November.
This led to a fall in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 micro, small and medium--sized businesses received deferrals on credit payments in 2021.

Pulmonologist Pulrisev suggested that people with weak immune systems are able to easily tolerate the strain "Okmiron "
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be able to tolerate it better than those with strong immune responses.
Pneumologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus " omicron " may prove to be dangerous.
The cause lies in the conditions under which the virus was born.
Scientists believe that " okmiron " was born in the body of an infected with HIV or immunodeficient person.
In other words, the mutation did not meet any resistance from the immune system.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response from the immune system, he became very aggressive.
It is likely that he has more of these spike proteins, spikes, than is allowed, their antibodies were not eliminated during the mutations - commented by the pulmonologist Sergey Purosev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be able to cope with " okmiron " more easily than those with strong immune systems.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection - is not always a good thing..
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is also the case with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die, and elderly people in their 60s in the form of a cough.
The immune response to rabies in young people is completely inappropriate, it is as if a cannon was being fired at a flock of sparrows - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, it is often possible to treat only the symptoms - all hope is on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia is the onset of intoxication of the body - this is the temperature, weakness and general malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, a feeling of constriction in the throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain also may signal a developing problem..
In the meantime, in Russia, by the end of the year, vaccination of the youth from 12 to 18 years old may begin.
The virologist and head of the genomic engineering laboratory at the MFPTI Pavle Volčkov noted that this category of people suffers a lot from the flu.

Immunologists proposed a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID.
The authors studied the fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells located in the fat tissue, the macrophages, were also infected, and they showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who died of COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in attempts to evade the immune system.
Possibly, SARS- CoV-2 is also capable of this..
A biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Gološeškin named the causes of dementia and described ways to prevent it in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome is characterized by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - the person gradually loses the ability to orientate even in familiar surroundings.
Gološević noted that dementia is most often caused by degenerative neurological disorders, head trauma, certain infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
On the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and the absence of active cognitive activity may play a role, he said.
Development of dementia is also influenced by bad habits - smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, irregular sleep patterns and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first symptoms, the expert noted forgetfulness, the inability to concentrate and a decrease in abstract thinking.
Discussions are underway that hearing loss may be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, or one of the risk factors for its onset. The biologist added.
In order to prevent the occurrence of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical fitness, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously a professor of the neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics department of the RNIMU of the FGAOU VO.
N.I. Pirogov, head of the department of cognitive disorders at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30,000 artefacts illegally removed from the country.
In the last 10 years, the Egyptian government has managed to repatriate about 30,000 artefacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, 11 December in the air of the Al- Hayat television channel by the chief inspector of the department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gaouad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artefacts.
This year alone, 5,300 ancient Egyptian artifacts were discovered at the Museum of Biblical Art in Washington, he said.
Abdel Gaouad clarified that all the artefacts smuggled out illegally are recorded in the archives.
The staff of the department are currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists " monitor auctions worldwide and sales on the internet through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that after the return of cultural treasures, they are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artefacts was the ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the Egyptian civilization National Museum in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help locate a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
On 4 July, auction house Christie's held an auction, at which a 3,000- year old bust was sold for $5.97 million (around 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that artifacts were illegally removed from the Karnak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the form of the god of the sun Amen, was kept in a private collection and has not been exhibited for sale since 1985.
It is not known how the relic made its way to Europe.
Egypt has been actively pursuing the repatriation of ancient artefacts illegally removed from the country in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by " black diggers ".
"The Crimean Tatars are not considered" – and this is correct, because the Crimean Tatars (2.320,000) are a separate nation ( close to the Turks.
If they want to add, they can only add 42,000 people - that is how many Tatars ( from Kazan ) live in Crimea ( according to the census ).
The Crimean Tatars are a distinct ethnic group, and the name of this ethnic group consists of two words.
The only thing that unites them is the Turkic language group.
FT reports that Credit Suisse wants to gain access to employees' personal mobile devices.
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
This is due to the fact that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of mobile phones or smartphones from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can inspect information on corporate devices given to its employees, as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or clients.
In extreme cases, the bank has the right to inspect mobile devices, for example, if a Credit Suisse employee used it for meetings with a client that were not approved by the bank.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices used for work purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management set a deadline for employees to familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially in Credit Suisse, information about the new requirement is not commented.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 – was fruitful in terms of his creative output, but the most difficult for the poet and his "ego".
He is not a member of any literary association, he has already distanced himself from imaginism, he is a solitary figure, but he is known, popular and sometimes severely criticized by critics, but the reading public is willing to carry him on its shoulders.
Over the course of a year, more than 60 poems were written, many of which were real masterpieces, the cycle of Persian motifs was completed, the poem " Anna Snezhina " was written, eight books and a collection of Soviet Russia were published..
The main success was in the end of June 1925, when Gosizdat signed a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
None of the modern Serguey Aleksandrovich poets have been so honoured, he was the first..
In addition, this offered very good money - according to the contract, the monthly salary was 1,000 rubles for 20 months ( a factory director, for example, received 300 rubles a month, an engineer 200).
Means were needed as never before in that year.
Eseinin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofya Tolstoy, and had to set up a family home, maintain the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seemed as if life was getting back on track, there was something to celebrate, but for him, everything was tinged with dark colors, as if the nightmare from the poems "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after his death) had materialized.
My friend, my friend,
I am very and very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Whether or not the wind is blowing.
Over the empty and deserted field,
However,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September,, as in September
Alcohol oozes into the brain.
Many of his acquaintances noted that Eseinin was very ill, that he looked very ill and that he was clearly ill.
More and more often, he is prone to breakdowns and nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably not only in alcoholism ...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was ever given to Sergey Alexander,, no authentic documents remain..
E.g. those related to May 1923, when, under pressure from his fourth wife, American Ayshe Dorian, he was recuperating in a clinic in Paris under the tutelage of Professor Petr Gannushkin ( two years later, in 1925, he would return to the clinic in Moscow, this time under the tutelage of Professor Petr Gannushkin ).
However, there are plenty of testimonies of the poet's drunkenness, scandals stemming from this cause, arrests by the police - scattered across dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 20s, the terrible romance between the poet and the green snake developed rapidly.
In the late summer of 1923, Eseinin lived for a short time with his friend, imaginist Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, at Eseinin's very good income, he never had his own housing in Moscow or St. Petersburg, he lived in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
Starec recalled:
He only came to sleep, and in the majority of cases in an incomprehensible, drunken state.
One day, returning home at four in the morning, Esejnin fell on the stairway landing. ...
Falling, scraping his face and coughing.
Coming to his senses, he began to cough uncontrollably, drenching the entire blanket in blood.
And even after his tour of Europe and the United States (the United States was dry at the time, but Duncan brought along a considerable amount of alcohol), Esejnin himself admitted:
I saw nothing there but taverns and streets.
I was already at the end and people started to forget him.
And he also drank,, of course.
He drank because he was homesick.

Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a " weapon " against the EU.
Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that Belarus is using migrants as " weapons "
Poland's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Pawel Jabłoński, expressed the opinion that President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as " weapons " against the European Union and intends to return to this " operation " in the next year.
In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, the deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a corresponding statement.
According to Yablonski, sanctions against Belarus temporarily " stopped Lukašenko, but he " is actively searching for new ways.
Also, the Polish official is convinced that now illegal migrants will use themselves as a weapon in many points of the world.

"Not by Sennik's jacket ": when the baroque jacket turns a man into a laughing stock.
In 2021, baroque jackets prevailed at social events.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig..
At the premiere of the film " Not Time to Die " in September, he appeared in a purple velvet jacket and a traditional " Bond " tuxedo.
After his example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore an inappropriate green barathea jacket for the award ceremony of the Earthshot Prize and then chose a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was tried on by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo..
The footballer came to collect the seventh " Golden Ball " in a Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
In addition, his sons were dressed in the same.
Alibaba's AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for baroque male jackets in Russia.
According to the analysts of the service, their sales increased by 1.4 times.
The most popular warm baroque jackets are those with a lining and a tailored silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, bordeaux, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is between 3,000 and 6,000 rubles. Men, on the other hand, prefer to buy exclusively waistcoats - they are less likely to choose barathea suits.
They can be bought not only by online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, baroque jackets are represented in almost all brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro and Saint Laurent.
The most coveted is the Gucci model, in which actor Jared Leto, ambassador of the brand, appeared at one of the premieres of the film "The House of Gucci".
By choosing jackets from expensive brands, one can be sure that the velvet is made from silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technique, a dense fabric with a hairy outer surface and a smooth inner surface is produced.
More budgetary options are made from cotton or polyamide, but they serve for a shorter period of time.
Fashion expert for Lamoda, Ilya Vahoschkin warns that in the case of the baroque jacket, the most important thing is not its model or style, but its suitability.
"Baroque requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if one is going to a party or a festive event, - explains Vahokshin. - It is also suitable for those occasions when the invitation specifies a dress code of " black tie " or " creative black tie ".
Another important criterion, the fulfillment of which allows the choice to be made in favor of the barathea jacket is the status of its purchaser.
A man in a baroque jacket, first and foremost, needs to acquire a proper and advanced social circle with a surplus,, according to the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Krasavchik Brammelel. - Owners of baroque jackets, as a rule, belong to the cast of people who rarely buy tickets..
They are simply invited to attend related social events, where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vahoschkin proposes to combine a barathea jacket with similar festive clothing: classic trousers with stripes, plain shirts, silk bow ties, loafers with pom poms and cuff buttons.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Krasaavchik Brammeilla" are convinced that it would be inappropriate for a sergeant to appear in a barathea jacket at a corporate event, but that if it is a " manager from among those who are running the event, then " yes, he can wear such a thing.
If the subordinate is of a lower rank, and his goal is to advance to a higher rank in a complicated hierarchy of the company or to obtain financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The editors of the Telegram channel for men's fashion consider that the management will definitely assess the phrase "not according to Senechka's cap".
A very ambiguous feeling from the voice.
This unnatural tone, so laboriously dragged out.
and is not associated with the cute face of a young girl.
If I'm honest, I don't understand the admiration surrounding him.
But from the bottom of his heart, he wishes success in life.

The immunologist said that re-vaccination after 4-5 months would help protect against the " omicron " strain of the coronavirus.
Re-vaccination after four to five months may protect against the new strain of coronavirus "omikron.
Such an announcement was made by immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov, who called the six--month vaccination period "a very long period".
Under previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is better to carry out the procedure after five months, and people with chronic diseases after four months, the expert said, calling at the same time for parallel vaccination and re-vaccination campaigns.
Kryuchkov also noted that early re-vaccination ensures good titers of neutralizing antibodies.
If a person has received two vaccinations and a booster, or if he has recovered and been vaccinated, or if he has been vaccinated and recovered, then he has " hybrid immunity ", which means that he has antibodies in abundance and neutralizing capabilities. - the expert added.

The document emphasizes that "military aggression " by Russia against Ukraine " will have enormous consequences and will be expensive for Moscow, but it does not describe specific measures.
The ministers of foreign affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union are united in their condemnation of the increase in Russian military strength and aggressive rhetoric in relation to Ukraine, the statement said.
The ministers then called on Russia "to de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding transparency in military activities, as President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on 7 December.
"We confirm their support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with the aim of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the ministers of foreign affairs of the " Big Seven " also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and serious consequences in response, they warn.

The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the omicron strain.
The effectiveness of the vaccine from the company Pfizer-Biontech against the omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other diseases.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, as reported by the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was judged to be less effective on the basis of the antiviral activity of citizens who received two doses of the vaccine against COVID-19.
"We see that the majority of people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original SARS--CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the Omicron variant," Professor Malik Peyris said.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable method of protection against a severe course of infection caused by the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of a pandemic of the coronavirus with the influence of the omicron strain.
The authors of the study came to the conclusion that the omicron strain may cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and an increase in mortality, unless additional measures are taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking NATO weapons deliveries to Kiev.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Aleksei Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of lethal weapons by Kyiv within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Rезniks recalled that in the previous month, Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti--sniper systems and anti--drone weapons.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its stance on rifles, recognizing them as non- lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to achieve the acquisition of the aforementioned weaponry through bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, it concerns the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
In the meantime, FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of permitting the delivery of weapons to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrei Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect deliveries of weapons from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of escalating the military conflict in Donbass, despite the "Russian occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same " illogical " position, diplomat is sure that Germany will maintain and under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky announced that Kiev expected assistance from Berlin in equipping the maritime fleet.
In Ukraine, they expect Germany to be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense, the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of the current year, the co- chairman of the German Green Party Robert Habek visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBK.

Part of the savings can be deposited on a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for purchases in the network.
If money was stolen during purchases in shops that do not use protective technology 3D Secure, it is possible to initiate the process of returning money.
According to the rules established by the payment systems, the responsibility for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure lies with the participant in the chain of transactions who does not use this service, the representative of PROMsвяuzbank clarified.
An expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Arthur Zaremba, emphasized that the buyer has the right to file a complaint with the bank within 120 days after the purchase to contest fraudulent transactions.

Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss the Nord Stream 2 project and EU legislation.
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the increase of Russian troops near the border with Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream 2.
Although Scholz announced his intention to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for a long time, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge German Chancellor Angela Merkel to oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is intended to transport Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravezky, Russia can use the gas pipeline as a means of political pressure against Europe.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels in the resolution of this crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement..
The European Court ruled that Poland's judicial reforms, carried out by the right--wing " Law and Justice " party, violated EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation has precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, did not take public commitments to stop work on the Nord Stream 2 project in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine on Tuesday, a high--ranking congressional staffer said.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz warned of consequences if Russia violates the Ukrainian border on Wednesday, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the " Big Seven " on Sunday.

At that time, about 200,000 dollars in cash and 400,000 dollars in the form of cheques were stolen from the church's safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, a reward of 25,000 dollars was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cole was not eligible for this amount, as the time limit for the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non--profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, at one time offering a reward of $5,000 and later receiving $20,000 in donations from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the honest plumber..
He will receive 20,000 dollars.

In Brazil, citizens are obliged to present a vaccination passport when entering the country.
In Brazil, the obligation to demand covid-19 passports was imposed on those entering the territory of the state, a corresponding decision was made by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) judge Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who are exempt from the obligation to be vaccinated are those who have contraindications to vaccination.
Also on the list of exceptions are those who have arrived from countries where vaccines have been proven to be absent.
The situation is even more serious if one considers that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for the celebration of New Year's, pre--carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist traffic. - Barroso noted.
Earlier, the authorities of Brazil obligated unvaccinated from coronavirus infection tourists to observe a five- day quarantine.
The full protection from COVID-19 scheme was revealed.
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, Russian Academy of Sciences, Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the full protection scheme from coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting vaccines and using nasal vaccines.
When administered intranasally, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are formed. This does not occur when vaccines are injected.
Immunglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside the body after vaccination, the most is formed of immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if they introduce both vaccines, they will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision on double vaccination yet, the doctor said.
The main advantage of nasal vaccination together with injectional vaccination is the possibility to stop being a carrier of the COVID-19 virus.
He added that this would help those who, in such a case, the protection of the organism should become maximal.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik- Gusseynov said that the new wave of the pandemic would lead to the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.

The conversation with the dog (who died a long time ago) was like this: if he is ready to give up the warm home, food, love and games for the momentary bitch, he can go ahead.
However, the pesel was trained and, in general, more intelligent.
He chose my society and went home.
The method shown in the video works in 90 % of cases.
It is not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
He stopped many owners so that they did not run after the dog, although they considered that more than 200,000 were running away (pomskies), he grabbed them by the hand and led them in a different direction.
In the end, "200,000 " chose the owner and not the dog, which ran somewhere.
In Europe, mass protests against vaccination continue.
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the plans of the authorities to make compulsory vaccination against the flu.

The WHO found " omicron " already in 60 countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new strain of coronavirus " omicron " has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The spread of the strain was reported by the World Health Organization in a statement.
According to the organization, on 9 December, the strain had already been detected in 63 countries, in all six regions of the World Health Organization.
This is despite the fact that it became active only at the end of November.
The WHO also expressed concern about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization's experts are concerned that the new strain, based on preliminary data, may outperform the " delta " strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which currently dominates in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated that the omicron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the United Kingdom.
The experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that " omicron " will dominate in the coming months.
The number of those infected only in the United Kingdom is estimated to be around 1 million. this despite the fact that officially "omicron" is currently infecting several hundred people and up to 10,000 according to estimates.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the " Omicron " strain, with peak hospital admissions of more than 2,000 people a day.
The British system of health care will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest research, the effectiveness of vaccines from the company Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain " omicron " is 32 times lower than against other diseases.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" vaccine reacts to " omicron " - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Institute only began testing the Russian vaccine on the Omicron strain.

Russians were warned of a new scheme by fraudsters.
Criminals began to look for new ways to commit fraud in video messages.
This is reported by " Izvestia " with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's product director Zaur Abu Talimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communications is deepfakes.
In this case, the perpetrators create a fake video based on real recordings with the participation of the victims.
Thanks to this, neural networks are able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behaviour of a particular person..
Abu Talimov added that with the use of disguise, the perpetrators can call relatives of the victims by video or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person for the purpose of extortion.
" Such counterfeits can easily provoke bullying, because a well--trained perpetrator can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo- scenarios, " - said the expert.
Varonis system engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that people are more likely to trust others when they see them.
He emphasized that this may create specific risks in the case of technologies using video.
David added..
In what he wrote above, he emphasized that all of this was bought in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow for much makeup and wearing short skirts, showing stockings and tights on the legs.
This province, but such goods were available in the Býl store..
In large cities and among Muslim women, they dyed their hair and showed their legs.

Five actions that help avoid diabetes are listed.
Problems with the level of sugar in the blood are one of the most widespread in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and they are wrong to do so.
Diabetes can, over time, lead to serious complications and even death.
Prophylactic measures play the most important role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of different drinks and switching to ordinary water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet products increase the level of sugar in the blood to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the path to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
In order to reduce the risk of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Specialists recommend a low--carbohydrate diet.
Sustaining such a diet not only helps to reduce weight, but also protects against sudden fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against the disease of diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of cellulose.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the secretion of digestive juices and the increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke of " migraine on the day of rest " among workaholics.
A number of factors can lead to the deterioration of health in the weekend.
The reason for the deterioration of one's health after working days is often " migraine on the weekend, " according to the famous doctor and endocrinologist, a candidate of medical sciences, a senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the University of Moscow, the scientific director of the Systemic Medicine Clinic Zhuhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, this is especially common among workaholics, who suffer from headaches, exhaustion and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue from the previous week, there are plenty of objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to the change in conditions.
In the weekends, one's life fundamentally changes.
"Sleeping long, all day lying on the couch,, probably eating more and drinking less, - the doctor argued. - Due to the lack of coffee, a small hangover begins..
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and exhaustion.
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if standing up three hours later than usual, there is a reaction, which is called jet lag.
It arises in travellers who cross several time zones.
In order to determine which of the factors plays the decisive role in the deterioration of health, Pavlov recommended observing what changes the most in the weekends.

South African scientists announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the " omicron " variant.
In South Africa, the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against " omicron " was announced.
Scientists from South Africa conducted a study and reported the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of " omicron ") corresponds to ( the level of ) effectiveness of vaccines in 22.5% against infections with symptoms, due to which ... the ability of vaccines to protect against infections is questioned, according to the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.

Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
The amount of hidden sugar in familiar products.
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unknown word in the composition of a product, a hidden sugar – an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index – may be listed.
The label may contain dozens of names, in essence, denoting sugar.
One of the most common and frequently encountered names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other extracted sugars, such as dextrose (cassava sugar), levulose ( fruit sugar ), melasse ( black treacle ), agave syrup and so on.
These are simple carbohydrates, which belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionary products,, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, in bread and so on.
According to the Russian Food Safety Agency, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, and to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar have different tastes, but no matter what the ingredient is called in the composition of the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that fruits, vegetables and so on initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
In this way, the total amount of sugar may turn out to be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany within 25 years.
The new Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are no longer important for Germany as the country continues its transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, by 2045, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate- neutral country.
That is, after 25 years, the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role, said the Chancellor.
Sholz noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to the idea that Ukraine should transport Russian natural gas and in the future, as this resource is important for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the United States made a statement in which they affirmed Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation.
Earlier, the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annalena Berbock said that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and discussions of the coalition agreement, it was announced that energy projects should be governed by European law in the field of energy.

According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted " against ".
The turnout was 43.9%,, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participating in the elections.
According to the agency France-Presse,, these preliminary results do not leave room for doubts, as the independence supporters urged the voters not to participate in the voting.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on 12 December, considering that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago made it impossible to hold a full and " honest " pre--election campaign.
As a result, this non--participation opened the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia after the referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020, 53.3%.
According to the separatists, they do not recognise the results of the last election and are challenging them in the UN.
On Sunday, 12 December, it was announced in the Elysée Palace that President of France Emmanuel Macron would make a speech on the results of the referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has played a large part in the last few weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates voiced support for keeping the territory in French hands because it is "the last European Union presence in the Pacific Ocean."
"New Caledonia must always remain French" - Eric Zemmour repeated many times.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valérie Pecresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on Calais residents to remain French.
On the other hand, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take up the position "because it is not his responsibility".
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Premier Minister Jean Castex, on the other hand, expressed " a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians would be the choice of France".

The first in the world unmanned aircraft with laser weapons was tested in Turkey.
In Turkey, the first successful tests of the world's first drone with laser weaponry took place.
The BPLA "Eren" was tested at distances of 100 to 500 meters, according to MIR24.
The device is able to neutralize explosive devices at a distance with the help of a laser.
The maximum altitude of the new aircraft is 3,000 m.
After successfully completing the corresponding tests, the BPLA will be put into service with the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without the involvement of sappers.
The agency points out that Turkey is one of the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

Readers of the WSJ criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States.
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article of professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his view of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern about the fact that the West allegedly brings Ukraine as a sacrifice to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow, and made a number of insulting remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell's speech, he called on western countries "to unite as one front against Russia.".
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"In this article, there is quite a lot of false information," one of the readers commented to RIA Novosti.
"Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not their land..
The United States and its NATO allies would never enter a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine, another said.

Ukraine will begin to produce the new generation of unmanned aerial vehicles.
The new Ukrainian- Turkish factory will begin creating the ANka type of reusable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
This was announced on 11 December by an advisor to the head of the Ukrainian President's office, Alexei Arestovich.
In other words, they are capable of acting against airborne objects, against other unmanned aerial vehicles.
EVEN against aircraft piloted.
They will be equipped with Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the fuselage and so on," he said to Diaglog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the Anka drones, Aresstovich said that they are not piston--driven, but reactive drones.
According to him, this new generation of unmanned aerial vehicles after Bayraktar, which exceeds it "in all respects".
The first batch of BPLA should be produced by the factory at the end of the following year, concluded Aresztowicz.
The Anka was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the unmanned aerial vehicle was carried out by the Turkish government in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff declassified information about the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in military operations by the united forces in Donbass.
On 6 December, Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky announced that construction of a factory for the production of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed a contract to build a training center in the Kyiv region, where personnel would be trained, as well as the testing and maintenance of Turkish UAVs Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the memorandum "a big realistic step forward".
Two lions escaped from a shipping container at the airport.
Two lions escaped from the Changi airport in Singapore.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from the container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the aircraft.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the fugitive lions lay down on the roof of a container..
Animals could not escape from it because it was surrounded by a protective fence.
The confrontation ended after the arrival of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which oversees all of Singapore's zoos.
They immobilized lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the capital of Cambodia, Pnompenh.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, there were no casualties among people.
Specialists warned of the threat of cancer from vitamin B9.
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there are strong indications that people who do not suffer from a lack of folic acid are less likely to suffer from certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose on the other hand promotes the growth of cancerous cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Betsy Kitts advises to keep an eye on the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if it significantly deviates from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without the advice of a doctor, to pay attention to the dosage and to avoid folic acid-containg cereals and other food products.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Raechel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is also contained in avocado, Fain recommended men over 50 to eat this fruit more often.
In the United Kingdom, by April, due to the omicron strain, about 75,000 people may die.
British scientists predict that due to the spread of the Omicron strain of the coronavirus, up to 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months, if the restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian with reference to the study of experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to Tass.
According to the most optimistic prognosis of the experts who are part of the scientific- advisory group for emergencies at the British Cabinet, by April 2022, the country will have recorded at least 25,000 fatalities due to the Omicron strain, and there would have been around 175,000 hospitalized patients.
At the peak of the epidemic, 2,000 infected people would be admitted to hospitals daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent overcrowding in the National Health Service if the omicron strain turns out to be more infectious than the delta variant, while the existing vaccines are unable to exclude infection, said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the Agency for Health and Safety in the United Kingdom informed that, if the rate of spread of the Omicron strain continues at the current level, by the end of the year there will be about 1 million cases of infection in the country.
By the middle of December, the Omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom, 1,898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of the coronavirus have been detected, of which 633 were detected in the last 24 hours.
On the other hand, on 9 December, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.
She wanted to write a witty comment,, but only got as far as this sentence:

The demand for superyachts has risen by a quarter in the world.
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for the following year broke all world records, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and the fight against climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units – 25% more than in the previous year.
In the era of the struggle against the consequences of climate change, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress worth more than 50 million dollars will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, they become more and more numerous.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that such a frenzy on the market has not been seen for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Previously, all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person. Now, the absolute majority of them work remotely and conduct negotiations via Skype.
Yacht broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that the owners are willing to pay more, as long as their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
" People just crave freedom, and the super- rich can afford it. he says.
In western society, many criticize such behaviour of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, according to sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, travels to space, life on yachts or flights in their own private jets cause resentment in society, because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists call on governments to act and suggest introducing new taxes and rules for super- rich, although they know that it will be extremely difficult to implement this in light of the high mobility of money.
On the other hand, impressive is not only the number of superyachts ordered, but also their characteristics..
Of the 1200 ships, 27 are over 100 meters in length.
The Norwegian billionaire Rokke is building the 183- metre long yacht Rev Ocean.
After launching, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a " lunar pool " as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, helipads for helicopters, open--air cinemas, and on some of them,, for example, on the yacht of boxer MacGregor - platforms for boxing. Professor of economic anthropology at the American university in Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of carbon emissions, the carbon footprint produced by super-rich is negligible.
However, it has symbolic significance, given that there are just over 2,000 multi--billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of excessive consumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists discovered that the emission signature of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces on average 5 tons of CO2 per year, Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere in 2018.
Meanwhile, two thirds of the emission trail landed on his yacht Eclipse, measuring 162.5 metres in length.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the crew continues to pollute the planet..
The owner can call the captain and give the order to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The owners of superyachts do not inspire sympathy when they, as the richest woman in Australia, Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that their giant ships have no place to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships with a length of more than 50 meters.
The weekly dose of alcohol that leads to the development of cancer of the small intestine has been determined.
American scientists determined the volume of alcoholic beverages per week that increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
The specialists came to the conclusion that the consumption of four or more portions of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with a higher risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
More than that, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of developing stomach cancer than women.
The exact cause of the development of such a type of cancer, scientists are unable to determine, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two- year old child.
Many, if not all dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they do not realize how well- developed four-- legged pets are.
Over the course of many years, biologists conducted a variety of experiments in order to conclusively determine the extent of intelligence in animals.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study has shown that a dog can understand up to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they do not understand politics, economics or art, but they often succeed in deceiving their owners..
The representatives of some breeds, according to experts, show the best results in understanding human language, but statistical data for precise conclusions is still insufficient.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered to be dog geniuses, such as labradors.
Scientists came to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of their ability to learn, are not inferior to a two- year old child.

In Ukraine, preparations were made to trade with the United States and Russia.
The United States and Russia will " negotiate " on the issue of Ukraine's membership in NATO, said analyst Alexander Kocjetkov in his article for the publication "Glavred".
According to his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations in the near future regarding the guarantees of the United States regarding the fact that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to join "anywhere they want".
If they offer something obviously unacceptable,, e.g. selling a close relative into sexual slavery, they are not going to haggle, they will just send the proposer away.
As far as Ukraine is concerned, negotiations are underway, - the analyst wrote.
Cocheotkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but aims for dialogue with Kyiv.
"The preparation is carried out covertly, quickly and immediately moves to the offensive, not waiting for the formation to be detected and the forces of counteraction to be deployed. " - he noted.
China is stimulating the development of the railway transport industry.
Chinese advanced technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 Chinese International Railway Transportation and Production Equipment Exhibition held in the city of Zhucheng in the province of Hunan, Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, said the company's representative, Hou Chao-wen.
High--speed trains running on the railway line between China and Laos, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, ensuring increased reliability and operability of the rolling stock.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased exports of railway transport vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe have witnessed " Chinese speed.
In May of this year, the first developed in China two--storey high--speed electric trains for export to Europe left the production line of the CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train, developed by the above- mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the line of the metro connecting the centre of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement on this line of the metro will be opened in the following year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometres per hour.
The Chinese industry for the production of railway equipment is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness, according to Feng Yao-shan, head of the trade and investment department of the Chinese Committee for the Promotion of International Trade / CCPIT.
This sector constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high--class equipment on the world market, according to Feng Yao-shan.
After more than 60 years of intense work, China has created a state--of the art system for the production of railway equipment, with a complete set of auxiliary facilities and large-- scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoqian, the country occupies first place in terms of the level of electrification of railways and in terms of the operating mileage on high--speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Gološeškin in an interview with radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, symptoms of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of moderate cognitive impairments, such as the inability to concentrate, plan, and abstract thinking.
At present, there is a discussion on whether hearing loss can be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease or one of the risk factors for its onset, said the specialist.
Gološević pointed out that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the cerebral arteries are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that, as of today, doctors do not know any effective ways of treating dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to begin its prophylaxis at an early stage.
According to him, the risk of developing dementia can be reduced by studying foreign languages and active communication.
Also, WHO recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logic.
There are recommendations for the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still debated in the scientific community, Gološević said.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical exertion, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logic thinking, Gološević said.
Earlier, a British charity dedicated to researching dementia announced that the disease is now affecting people in their 40s.
Medics named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign is problems with vision, due to which the patient has difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is aphasia - the state when a person cannot find the right words to express what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment.
The former president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili is in need of psychoneurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the council of doctors created by the ombudsman of Georgia.
His [ Saakashvili's ] neurological status is the most important factor in his illness.
Stabilizing problems are problems with movement, coordination and changeable character, the specialist said, noting that this does not exceed the normative limits and now the former president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is called neuro-rehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which in Georgia he did not find - said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
In the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotage receiving medical assistance after penitentiary service staff subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore himself to his previous rights..

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain.
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against compulsory vaccination certificates against COVID-19 took place, as reported by the Europa Press agency.
In the Catalan capital, approximately 3,000 people took part in the action.
In Barcelona, COVID passports became mandatory for entering bars, restaurants, sports halls, nursing homes and nighttime entertainment venues.
Many manifesto participants came to the action without masks.
The slogans on their placards accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination certificates are also required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with more than 50 seats.
The protesters in this city complained about a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of infection with the coronavirus have been detected, more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, there are also plans to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people.
The government introduced a bill for a single QR code system to the State Duma on 12 November.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places where mass events are held, cultural institutions, places of public catering and retail trade with the presentation of a vaccination certificate or a certificate of illness, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for trips on trains and planes.

A steep climb: how Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international- level ski resorts in the country.
In China, they hope that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to participate in winter sports, which would allow the president, Xi Jinping,'s goal of raising 1 trillion yuan to be achieved, but also contribute to the economic development of the backward and remote provinces.
The ski resort of Taibai in Changchengkou, located not far from the site of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese.

There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.

More than 500 million people in the world may be plunged into extreme poverty due to the pandemic of the coronavirus, which slowed down the progress of humanity in the matter of universal access to health services, said in the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank (WB).

In this context, immunization coverage fell for the first time in 10 years, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
The WHO and the World Bank emphasized that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it more difficult for people to pay for treatment.
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "to extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services from their pockets.

Reuters reported that the Taiwanese minister was removed from the broadcast of the " Summit for Democracy " at the request of the White House.
Minster of Digital Technology Oder Tann's speech at a panel discussion during the organized by the United States " Summit for Democracy " was translated into English without video, as a video recording of the summit is available on YouTube.
According to Reuters, citing sources, the picture was removed at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the cause was a map on which Taiwan was colored differently from China, which considers the island part of its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was composed by the South African non--governmental organization Civicus and ranked the countries of the world according to the degree of protection of civil rights.
Taiwan was marked green as "free" and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were marked red as " closed ".
After the minister showed the map, a picture of her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily represent the position of the United States government.
China was not invited to the " Summit for Democracy.
Sources of Reuters note that the map presented by the Taiwanese minister could go against the policy of "one China" to which Washington adheres.
One of the sources of the agency said that after the demonstration of the maps, the National Security Council of the United States angrily contacted the Department of State, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organised " Summit for Democracy " took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil organisations and charitable organisations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.

In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they spoke of a " sad conclusion " in relations between Russia and the United States.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Riabkov in an interview with " Izvestia " assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of cooperation led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries began not yesterday.
There is a one--sided negative predictability, but in some parts there is a possibility of improving relations, which is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion after a long journey, which they have travelled with the current administration and with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday, the diplomat said.
According to Riabkov, the problems stem from the United States' desire to impose its approach to a number of issues on Russia.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he did not dare to give optimistic predictions about the prospects of improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cyber security, progress has not been made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and that Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
A virologist warned of the danger of vaccinating with a nasal Covid vaccine outside of hospitals.
People who have been vaccinated with nasal vaccines against COVID-19 may suffer from allergies and require medical assistance, which is why the first vaccination points for these vaccines should not be set up in airports and shopping centers.
This was announced by TASS virologist, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of biological nanotechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netezov.
Organizing vaccination points for nasal vaccines in airports and shopping centers is easier, but I would do this only in medical institutions at first.
This is due to the fact that the possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but desirable for the person to sit next to the doctor's office after it.
Doctors have special sets of anti- allergic drugs, which act within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary, said Netezov.
According to the virologist, it would be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when the experience of using the vaccine has been accumulated.
He also emphasized that when using nasal vaccines, it is important for the vaccine to land on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated sneezes after being sprayed in the nose with the vaccine.

The inhabitants of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, an overwhelming majority of participants voted to remain part of France.
This was announced on 12 December by French television channel BFM.TV.
Against independence, 96.5% voted.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
They annulled the results of 2.99 percent of the ballots.
The turnout on this day was very low, with only around 55% of the archipelago's inhabitants voting.
According to experts, the low turnout was due to separatist calls to boycott the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Parish refused to move the date of the referendum..
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, the region already held a referendum on the issue of independence.
The majority of the inhabitants supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 km away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia as its territory.
The archipelago is inhabited by around 270,000 people and has special administrative and territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration allows the region to hold a referendum on its independence twice every two years.

WHO preliminarily considers " omicron " to be less dangerous than " delta "
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that " omicron " is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines against the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information from 9 December, " omicron " has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the " omicron " strain suggest that vaccines against infection and transmission may be less effective.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is believed that the " severity of the disease " may be less severe than during " deltas " - as stated in the technical report of the WHO.
The organization notes that all registered cases of infection with " omicron " in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary estimates, spreads faster than " deltas ".
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They were "pre--immunized" according to the Center for Gamaleya.
Rospotrebnadzor head Anna Popova stated that there are no reliable data on the fact that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

The Ukrainians named four scenarios for Zelensky.
The former member of the Ukrainian Parliament, Vadim Denisenko listed four possible developments for President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
According to his opinion, the head of state may lose the support of the West, as well as, possibly, make compromises in the Donbass.
On Sunday, 12 December, Denisenko spoke about this in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
The first variant, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm," implies that key western countries would stop supporting Ukraine, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis, with which Kyiv may face in 2023.
" Parallel to this, the prices of key goods, which are traditionally exported < ... > internal protests and opposition to the government with key FPG (finance and industrial groups. - Red.) " - added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
In the event of high turbulence in world politics, when the Ukrainian government faces a number of problems,, this forecast will come true.
Due to this situation, the Ukrainian leadership may compromise on the Donbass issue, as a result of which there is a possibility of internal conflict in the country.
At the end of the summer, the position of Zelensky weakened, the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former deputy, is between 50 and 55%..
The third possible development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between those who are not in agreement with Zelensky's group of people and the president, as a result of which the possibility of seizing control over the power bloc and the implementation of " populist initiatives " is possible.
In the course of such a variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reorganizing power," added Denisenko.
An alternative scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
This may be the result of some event that becomes a major shock to society.
"The event must be large enough to trigger a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," - said Denisenko.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of natural disasters, technological catastrophes or aggressive actions by Russia, according to the former deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has already several times rejected any possibility of an " attack " on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the sociological group " Rating " showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record low levels, reaching 19.3%..
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted the situation in which, in the case of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, 21.8% of the votes would be cast for Zelenski and 14.5 % for the former president of the country, Petro Poroshenko.
Among those surveyed, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Arrested for an action on the Red Square poet: "For the citation of Evtushenko, 10 days are given, this is the power of poetry. "
At the beginning of the week, the 21- year old poet Alexander Volochenkov was arrested for 10 days.
A student of the VŠE was detained on the Red Square with a placard on which was written the hashtag #poets of Russia more than poets.
This quote belongs to writer Evgeny Evtušenko.
Alexandra was charged with an administrative offence for a second time for violating the order of conducting a public demonstration.
The first time he was detained was on 23 January at the Pushkin Square demonstration in support of Aleksei Navalny.
The aim was to draw attention to poetry as a whole, sadly, interest in it has waned, as has the decline of Russian culture as a whole and a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the internet under this hashtag. Alexander explains.
They contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and more fully reveal the message of his message.
How the police officers treated them when they were detained this time and previously.
What they asked in the department, how they commented on their action.
This time, the employees were more correct, the detention was the maximum, polite and, in some contexts, funny.
On the Pushkin Square, the OMON took over and took over hard.
The standard question was about motivation.
When they heard it, in principle, they looked at it if not approvingly, then understandingly.
With the exception of the 4--sided ventilated monkey cage, everything was perfectly correct, but he knew what he was doing.
And if, after the action under this hashtag, at least a few people begin to write their poems,, then these 10 days of detention are not wasted..
Maxime, according to the protocol, he would talk to him alone in the language of the Tumbu Yumbu tribe.
At public and official events, they speak the language of the surrounding people so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through a translator.
This is a protocol and nothing more,, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks fluent Russian and yet she relies on the help of a translator.
And at official events, stenography is still carried out by hand, in the old-fashioned way,, and the stenographer is not obliged to know several languages.

Researchers explained how potatoes help in the fight against age--related disorders.
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and microelements that improve blood circulation and reduce the level of cholesterol.
The root vegetable contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, riboflavin, folic acid and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help to function the systems of the body.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-- related disorders.
Due to its high content of glycoproteins, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract and, when consumed regularly, may also help in the prevention of high blood pressure and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable is best boiled or boiled, rather than fried in oil.
The Daily Express previously warned that potatoes may be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other products with a high glycemic index.
Theses are products with a high content of carbohydrates that are quickly broken down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet non- alcoholic drinks, white rice and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Komsomolskaya Pravda" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private hobby farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only be compensated by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates have been removed from the search results of "Yandeks".
Candidates for elimination
In 2015, the rights holders from the cluster "RAEK/ Media " compiled a list of 100 largest pirate sites of the Russian internet, and most of them ceased to exist, said the director of the Institute of Internet Research Karen Karazyan.
However, some - Kinogo, Lostfilm and Filmix – managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular change of domain names, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results as "Yandeks" and " Google, one can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series " The Game of Thrones " and " Neighbours " directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest Russian video-on- demand service Ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the search results of search engines, one can watch the animated newcomer " Encananto, but, judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screening ( a pirated copy of the film filmed in a cinema ) .
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 years later" of the TNT channel ( part of " Gazprom-media ") is available.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, according to a report in Sunday's Aktuell.
The goal of the five--year missions is to assess the habitability of Venusian clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartarian scientists proposed instruments for measuring the acidity and oxygen content of Venusian clouds.
Until now, it was assumed that Venus' clouds, the nearest planet to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a terrestrial planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Assumedly, if they find life there, the main question would be whether it is similar to earthly or different.
If very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth did not begin on Earth.
If there is a difference, it is more likely that life originated on Earth, said the leader of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Mikhkeil Paijusalu.

Metaverses change Russian business.
The theme of metaverses became popular in the fall of this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new form of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in the creation of its own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend for creating distant interactions in the context of the pandemic, because people were tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
The third is that they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, valuable papers, works of art and even money are transferred into a digital format.
Ane, they are right, changing the diet is a conscious process.

The British economist was unable to give a forecast for 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for the 2022 year, because, according to his opinion, such attempts would end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change direction.
The most important factor remains the pandemic of the coronavirus, and on the second place is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in prices for goods is temporary or not.
According to the specialist, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the era of infinite generosity of central banks had come to an end" and that it was time to return to relations where interest rates, adjusted for inflation, corresponded to expected rates of growth in GDP.
O'Neill noted that in the context of the pandemic, continuation of the super soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and the change in climate, concluded O'Neill.
Earlier, head of the global research department of "Open Investition" Michail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar's exchange rate in 2022 remain, although the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar's course, Shulgin named the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears in the wake of the pandemic.

Roughly 4.5% of the country's GDP was handed over to car dealers.
In the first 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 27.84 billion euros on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period of the previous year, according to data from the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI).
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the pandemic of the coronavirus.
In September 2019, during the meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such a sum is comparable to more than 4.5% of the internal gross domestic product (GDP) of the country in 2020.
On the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is in the lead in terms of income.
In the first 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 32.5.7 billion roubles, which is almost 24% more than the previous year.
Hyundai's related Kia brand saw an even greater increase, of more than 35 percent, while revenue from the sale of vehicles was estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
On the leading positions, this brand and in terms of the increase in the average price of a car – in one year, Hyundai's average price rose by almost 21%,, to 1.94 million roubles – was more dynamic than that of Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes- Benz.
However, the sales volume of Korean brands did not increase as much: according to the statistics of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more vehicles in the same period last year.
Hyundai - nearly 12%..
The Japanese Toyota brand closes the top three in terms of sales volume in terms of monetary value, with Russians spending 27.55 billion euros on its vehicles over the past 10 months, an increase of 14 percent compared to the previous year.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes- Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion roubles (+75 %) – the German premium brand's sales increased by 37 % and the average price of a car by 28 % to 8.2 million roubles.
At the same time, Mercedes- Benz is experiencing a good increase in sales and an average increase in prices greater than that of BMW, as a result of which there is a greater increase in financial capacity. as explained by NAPi General Director Tatjana Arabbaj.
In terms of sales growth, fantastic figures are shown by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.
In terms of income growth, the Russian Lada demonstrates mid--range results (plus 28 percent), Russians spent 229.4 billion roubles on Lada cars in the first 10 months of the year.
Companies such as Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan, which sold fewer machines in 2021 than in 2020, are at the same level as the previous year in terms of financial capacity.
UAZ, on the other hand, is in the red - in the first 10 months of the year, Russians spent 12 billion roubles on the manufacturer's vehicles, down from 12.4 billion roubles the previous year.
Against the backdrop of problems with component deliveries and production disruptions affecting the entire world's automotive industry, automobile companies continue to adjust prices, with the same "AvtoVAZ" raising the price of Lada models seven times over the course of a year, the last increase (by 8,000 to 10,000 rubles) occurred at the end of November.
They regularly change the prices of their products and other car manufacturers do the same.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation and the desire of car manufacturers to recover past losses are contributing to this, according to experts.
In the context of a shortage of cars, I think that many car manufacturers were even able to partially transfer the costs of previous periods to the consumer, which they were not able to include in the price of cars before.
according to the VTB Capital analyst Vladimir Besspov, -
It is believed that the financial situation of the car manufacturers is very good at the moment, with high margins on sales.
An indirect indicator of this is the pace of growth in the cost of automobiles observed in 2021, the cost of new vehicles is growing faster than inflation, the expert explains.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and in terms of money, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the construction of the machines, predicts Bessaplov.
As demand increases, the ability to increase prices is limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automobile market continues to grow and in the future year, even if the price growth slows down, the automobile manufacturers will be able to obtain their profits thanks to the volume of sales, according to independent consultant for the automobile industry Sergey Burgazliyev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to obtain the maximum profit from each sold car, according to Burgazliev.
The production of machines is not expected to increase at least for the next six months, while in Russia, the situation is further aggravated by citizens' lack of confidence in the future.
Against the background of the market situation, cars turned out to be a good object of investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its initial price, the expert concludes.
Biden spoke about the possible deployment of US troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion.
The United States never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion.
The president of the United States, Joe Biden, made such a statement.
"There has never been such plans," - said the head of the White House, responding to a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
However, he emphasized that the United States and NATO do not have obligations to use military force to defend Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of deploying American troops in a unilateral manner for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukrainian territory, the United States would move forces to eastern European NATO countries ( Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"The United States and NATO will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all the countries of NATO, in relation to which there is a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia - said Biden.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
He also pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat deployment of the drones delivered by Turkey, as well as in the fact that " American weapons are approaching Russian territory.

A collection of wool for felting " Assortment No. 2 " 100% merino wool, wool 4x10 g.
