The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods.
I am #PRS Org #'s major client, so it is not a problem for him.
All he needs is a number or an instruction as to what the package should be attached to so that it can be tracked by them as a return.
A few days ago, I ordered the # PRS Org # for 249 euros.
Today it costs 179 euros.
I find this honestly very annoying.
Whether he has to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or there is another way to get the compensation.
I also believes that children should not be asked to assume the role of a parent for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for the big brothers to take care of the little ones to a certain extent.
A quick look, a quick helping hand, bringing the bottle etc.
They learn responsibility, help in the family and are integrated.
As long as they are still young enough to be children,, there is no problem.
If his K1 is alone for a short time and it is OK for him, that is good.
He himself can best assess whether this is suitable for his children.
It is not so that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally, it is questionable.
This may also be the reason for the statement of the psychologist.
In the event that something actually happens like a fire, a break--in, an earthquake or an alien invasion, it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether or not this is a risk that he wants to take is, of course, up to him.
Help me find the title of a book again.
A few years ago, he read a crime novel or a thriller, and he can still remember almost the entire plot, but he cannot remember the title.
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by drowning himself in food and entering the enclosure of the big cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, becomes involved with a therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with a fear of hospitals.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up at this therapist's place.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document and upload the photos to the internet.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist runs an underground therapy group where the patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients are forced to confront their fears in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumped out of the window and another drove herself to death on purpose)
The fight against fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic of the one who had a fire to do with.
This is the general plot of the book, I am quite sure that the original book was written by a French author or authoress.
If this action is known to someone or even if someone can reveal the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi..
He must first contact his husband.
However, this can take a long time.
What steps he must take after that.

Now the child reacts hysterically when they try to do it.
No more chance.

Due to Omikron, Johnson wants to promote the booster vaccination.
Policymakers and scientists in the United Kingdom are being besieged by new cases of the Omikron variant.
By New Year's Eve, therefore, all qualifying adults in England will have received an offer to be vaccinated.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to accelerate the pace of the Corona booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, so long as three months have passed since their second vaccination, the Prime Minister said in a pre--recorded video message to the nation on Sunday night.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The British government would provide additional support to speed up the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omikron variant, the situation is an emergency, which is why the vaccine protection must be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the protection level with a third vaccination dose can be increased again.
"Now is the time to get vaccinated, said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more cases of the Omikron variant were recorded in the United Kingdom, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I am in favor of everyone presenting themselves with pronouns.
I have sent in an application.
Today, the invitation to a meeting was sent by mail.
I will respond to the e-mail.
However, the name is not "Peter" but a somewhat more complicated name.
He has been Googled and depending on his or her cultural background, he is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone help me.
He is a foreigner and does not want to have a bureaucrat step on his feet.
Conclusion: everyone should think about pronouns.
In total, he has 5 books on him.
There are four of them.
Only the one that I bought today does not work.
Obviously, the chair had a not apparent defect at the time of sale.
It is not clear how such a cushion damage can occur after 9 months.
It was first attempted on the PRS Org.
However, this has been working for about 20 years.
not more than 14 days.
Therefore, the last books have always been bought through the website and then read on the PRS Org.
I bought 6 #PRS # orgs and wanted to buy 8 more.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want them to please add two chairs to the order and bill them.
[CW]The feeling when I can't help.
The content of this article contains a detailed description of domestic violence.
I just have to write something from the heart.
As a 21- year old, he comes into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A theme that really bothers me and happens far too often is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or think that they cannot be helped.
He is well aware that they cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in his profession that move him more than when he cannot do anything in such situations.
I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes.
Even in a one--on- one conversation with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children from that environment.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, is that everyone deserves to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to tolerate violence.
Often he wishes he could help in some way, but he knows he can't.
However, this does not make it any easier.
Please, always remembers that they are worth living without violence, which is so incredibly important..
" Arcane " on Netflix - What the series based on " League of Legends " is worth.

Basketball Bundesliga - Derby debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick, you could count on him..
Again nothing: For the second time within less than three months, the Giants lost to Crailsheim - and how.
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back on the cup defeat in early October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "They still have a little bit of fire in their belly.
However, after the game, he did not lay down, but instead increased his performance in the face of the 61-72 (28-38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whilst more than the naked result, the manner of the performance disappointed.
A representative example is a statistic that expresses the whole problem: The three--quota was only 13 percent, 4 goals ( all of which were scored by the young Johannes Patrick ) from a total of 31 attempts - more questions.
The answer came from John Patrick: "After the victory in Tenerife, they were not concentrated enough and did not implement what they had trained. "
To move the ball.
However, his counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted in a completely different way: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time in a row, said the happy coach.
It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people.
There were only 750 spectators allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they were not disappointed.
In addition, thanks to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game of his team.
"The best playmaker I ever coached, Gleim said.
Whilst in Patrick's team, the team's main performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7 points) failed miserably.
Only in the last quarter (22-15), the Giants prevented a total disaster and came within eight points of closing the gap to 39-59, after having already fallen behind by 59-39.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Luckily, a lot of time is left to argue.
Already on Wednesday (19:00) the Giants received the Skyliners Frankfurt, and then also in Ludwigsburg in front of a maximum of 750 spectators.
Previously, they had a different email address, but they have changed it.
Yes, he had already reported himself several months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
They have been legally re--informed and have therefore been re-written to them..
They had originally contacted us half a year ago..
As if peeled from an egg, Max Raabe turns 59.
He can captivate his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is touring with the program "Guten Day, dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform at all.
Originally, Max Raabe was going to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig on Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022, "at the behest of the authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
Also, other of his planned appearances during the Advent, have to be postponed,, as it says on the website of the singer, who is now 59 years old, and his musicians (Palast Orchestra) .
From January, the artists want to make up for the concerts that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine- Westphalia, Max Raabe has sung a lot as a young man.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of Schlager and chanson in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many prizes.
HIs live album from the "Mtv Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of the charts, just like his successful album "For Women it's no problem" (2013 ).
He has gone from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair neatly combed back and with an eye on etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer missing from the current German--speaking music scene.
With the programme "Guten Day, dear Luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

It still doesn't work, all he can do is turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Housing and Urban Development Klara Geywitz: through expropriation, no new housing is created.
The new Federal Minister of Housing and Urban Development Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations as demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
" With an expropriation, no new housing is created, only the ownership structure changes, said Geywitz in an interview with the " Tagesspiegel " (Sabbath).
My goal is to give tenants the security that their rent will remain affordable in the next years.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Green Party and the Left Party will set up an expert commission to determine how to handle the results of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz said he was in talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement stipulates a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental index.
I will talk to the Justice Minister to implement it as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not calm down,, the SPD politician said that she would discuss further steps with her coalition partners.

Then he separates the self--starter from the new order.
Many thanks for the speedy clarification.
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long it takes to ship itself.
He has already cut himself on the finger.
This is an absolute outrage
At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes swept across the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 dead could be claimed.
The pictures from there resemble a war zone.
In the night of Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe damage and possibly up to 100 deaths in the United States.
The storms left behind an approximately 320 kilometre long path of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Gov. Andy Beshear said after visiting the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings – gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects the death toll in the state of Kentucky alone to reach up to 100, with the official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that Vitrine # Name # is sold out.
This is very sad.
It is still being produced.
Or it has been completely removed from the catalogue.
There is the possibility to order this vitrine in another country.
by when to report.
If the delivery does not take place in his apartment, he must cancel the order.
I understand that, but he can now order the blanket and have it delivered to Germany, where it is in the shopping cart..
He had sent an article back through the contact form, or a return request, and wanted to know whether it had arrived or was being processed, as he had not received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising slogans
Whilst the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for an immunization premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money incentives to be vaccinated.
This puts them in line with the Social Partners, the ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into calls for Corona vaccinations (after the German model) is intended to increase the willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He has changed companies over which he has gossiped.
This does not make his situation any better than hers.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It is a year ago.
He has, after all, not stuck to his old place and has been looking for something else.
This can also be done..
and that he didn't like her back then - it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either..
There are too many variables.
They should accept the cancellation.
This will then become legally relevant.
I take a screenshot.
Good morning - I'm interested in the Boone dining table, white.
It is also available in 230 cm in Grand.
The Onlineshop kitchenpoint.de sells all Smeg kitchen appliances and the corresponding accessories.
They generally check the quality and completeness of the order.
The new Smeg coffee machine brings freshly ground coffee into the kitchen or the office.
The simple and reduced design, the plastic surface in matte colors in combination with the matte-brushed stainless steel front make the new SMEG coffee vending machines with milk foamer a design object.
The reduced design allows all functions such as grind size and water amount, as well as the choice between an espresso, an Americano, a Ristretto or a mild coffee, to be selected with only four knobs.
Thanks to the Dampflanze, coffee milk and milk foam specialties can also be prepared.
Help with the first own campaign
Boron for greetings.
He is currently leading a group of four friends through the adventure Over the Greifenpass and wants to seamlessly transfer the heroes to a campaign written specifically for the players.
They play DSA 5.
The great arc has been made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been imagined and now he is writing the opening adventure and stumbles over his own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are tasked with transporting a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There, the further action develops.
A few miles from the village, the heroes are ambushed by a group of goblins and lured into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: to persuade, to act, to intimidate, to recognize the danger early on, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords.
The Goblins lay in wait for the hero in a hollow way and flanked him to the left and right with bows, while two with spears stopped the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, he has two possible solutions.
The heroes all become unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, the half-elf joins with two of his servants and comes to the hero's aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is fine.
Deus ex Machina holds that Lösung 2 is not a solution.
If the Encounter is too much of an introduction to the adventure.
The group of goblins will later play a decisive role and is not just cannon fodder.
Edit: Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not with so many good suggestions and tips.
I will definitely incorporate many of their ideas and has now regained confidence in his narratives.
He took the lamp apart again.
and again, together woven.
Alas, it still doesn't work..
So I would still like to send them back.
They can then send the backs to come in, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS Org #.
Shipping costs and time savings - and at the same time the environment is relieved.
If he needs more than one article, he should press "pay now" only when he has all the articles in the shopping cart.
This means that automatically the combined delivery is calculated, and he gets everything in one package.
By doing this, he saves himself the multiple purchase and payment process and the environment is happy because no unnecessary packaging material and unnecessary fuel is used for the delivery of multiple packages.
Faster delivery with DHL, DPD and the German Post.
In the normal case, the shipment is sent out on the day of payment, as long as the payment has been received by 14:00.
In order to ensure that his package reaches him as quickly as possible, he should pay attention to the fact that his address is complete and also on his letter box and his doorbell that his name is written.
If he wants to, he can have his package sent to a post office depot.
Then choose DHL, because only DHL is allowed to deliver at DHL packing stations.
They send him an e--mail with the shipment number, if he has chosen DHL or DPD as the shipper.
Thus, he can already see where his package is at around 22:00.
The satisfaction of the customer is the goal - all five stars count.
If he is satisfied with them, he would be pleased if he gave them a positive rating and gave them five stars in the detail ratings.
If it should ever happen that not everything has been done to his fullest satisfaction,, he would be grateful if he reported to them before giving a rating.
Only in this way they have the chance to do everything they can to make him happy.
They did not do anything to the chair..
Suddenly, the crack appeared.
I was just sitting there.
Here the lower part was damaged, i.e. the part with storage space.
Then everything will be taken back or only the storage space part.
I'm fed up with Sky Sport F1.
Hello, dear Formula 1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality of the German Sky broadcasts has been declining,, which is why he wanted to make this post to clear the air.
Firstly, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to start the Formula 1 pre-views on time.
However, due to the delayed start and the start accident, the schedule was far behind the planning, but the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!) could still be shown.
It seems, however, that from a legal standpoint, F1 has priority and as a result everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice in the matter.
But still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the race.
Despite this, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well followed the difficult situation around the heavy accident.
Then there was a rule misunderstanding among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, who did not know that it is allowed to change the tyres under a red flag.
Already in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, this situation occurred, but both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change his tyres after receiving radio messages to this effect from Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately realized that this possibility existed for Verstappen.
In my opinion, such basic rules should be known when commenting on Formula 1 on a pay- television channel.
It is also not the first time that there has been speculation about what is now possible or mandatory according to the rules, both are constantly uncertain about the rules.
In general, Roos' artificial commenting style does not appeal to him, but he admits that it is a matter of taste.
But even Heiko Water of RTL is more serious to me..
This is also accompanied by constant silliness, which make both of them appear unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee by reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter, in particular, brings a lot of disruption to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
In addition, the advertising takes over at Sky, in the run-up to the race, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV after the race, when only the German soundtrack without commentary can be heard directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
In addition, these two stations make less advertising in their training than Sky, and as a free TV station.
However, Glock and Baumgartner must be praised for their work, but this alone does not allow one to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programme is also very thin and full of repeats.
In general, Sky is the worst German--speaking channel to broadcast Formula 1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast until the end of the season.
In other words, the grandiose F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a decent broadcaster.
I would like to know what they think.
The light fixture here is a #PRS Org # pendulum light, made of brass and colored glass x 1.
Hello, he had an article that was due to be delivered last week, which has still not been delivered..
He has contacted the chat twice and nothing has happened so far.
The First Lady told me that it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she would review and send an e--mail and she never responded.
Hello, on 12 December 2019, I ordered two # PRS # orgs.
One of them has already shown a defect ( the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair ) after a relatively short time.
I ask for help.
Fan pumps are well suited for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system with air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by the company.
At the end of the offer, they look at the table.
There, they can see the comparison of the services..
If the pumps are strong enough, they can be used to power entire facilities.
If one owns a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that more outlets can be connected.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. Fans can also be used to set an accent in an aquarium,, e.g. with a air curtain (available in the shop) or with a decoration that turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, a shell or something similar.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction, which results in low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected via a 4 to 6 mm air hose to an Auströmer or the like, and then it can get started.
The fan pump should be at the same level, or higher than the water level, and should be placed outside.
If the pump sits lower than the water level, a backflow preventer should be placed between the pump and the reservoir.
The air hose is simply cut through and the ventilator is placed in between.
This would prevent the water from flowing backward, so that the water from the basin flows through the pump.
If the windmill pump is to be placed in the open, it should be covered and protected from moisture.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that use little energy.
Even though eBay lists the processing time as 3 days, the packages are packed every day and the packages are also picked up every day.
When running, everything is going well, it goes very fast.
They only want to make a little effort to prevent anyone from getting upset, just because it took a little longer than expected.
It would be so that not everyone has understanding for all the employees, who also work in the transport industry. After all, the coronavirus does not stop here.
They should not be judged too harshly, only because the delivery is delayed, it is only due to the courier services.
Naturally, one complains a lot about these services, even though at the moment they say that they are having a hard time.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will also be better times again.
how long it takes to order the yellow with and without armrests.
It was also possible to order the legs in white here.
Amazon founder Bezos sends the daughter of an astronaut and a TV presenter into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system " New Shepard " of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the roughly ten--minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a blazing blue sky, Bezos personally greeted the newly- knighted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit as he opened the hatch of the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one after the other and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds in the air and reached an altitude of 10,700 meters.
The 74- year old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50 year old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets - astronaut engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not reveal how much they paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled the mission of her father after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his assignments.
She was just along for the ride, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to go back to space as soon as possible, said the moderator.
" New Shepard " flies up to 100 kilometers.
The rocket system " New Shepard " flies mostly autonomously.
During the flight of the rocket, the capsule separated and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometres above the Earth, at times experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned spaceflight of Blue Origin, the first in July saw Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82- year old former US pilot and an 18 year old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, famous for his role as " Captain Kirk " in " Star Trek " was present, as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing the business of space tourism without any scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.
By pressing a button, they can easily decide whether their "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in one color or display its entire color spectrum.
In the case of color change, the Leuchtstein retains a light color for around one minute before gently shifting to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp allows it to be used throughout the year in the open air.
In snowy surroundings, its light makes itself particularly well known – only the duration of the light is shortened when the days become shorter.
In the winter, they should only pay attention to the fact that no snow affects the function of the solar panel.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon ( "AA ") format, which can be easily swapped out when needed.
A suitable replacement battery can be obtained through the webshop and so the use time of the Dekoleuchte can be extended even further.

Perfectly, this is true. there is nothing else that needs to be added to it.
All they need is the tracking number in his mail.
Someone who works or studies biochemistry.
At the moment, he is studying in the first semester of biochemistry and finds the subject itself quite interesting and the laboratory work does not bother him ( he has already completed the inorganic chemistry practical ).
He had already informed himself about career prospects before the start of his studies, but he also thought at the time that he would definitely complete his studies up to the doctorate and that he would become one.
At the moment, however, doubts have arisen, especially concerning the career prospects.
On the one hand ( Studycheck etc ) one hears again and again super career opportunities and the profession is totally in demand, on the other hand one hears again and again of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
As a result, I would really like to know:
What they are currently working on.
2) They are satisfied with their work and salaries.
3) What they have studied or what qualifications they have.
If they were to do it all over again, they would do it again.
Many thanks for the replies.
At the moment, I'm really unsure and is thinking about breaking off the studies in 2022 and taking up an apprenticeship as a computer scientist.
If they have any experiences, they are also welcome to write them down.
Extra Stress on holiday and holiday weekend days.
This topic came up last week with me.
However, he had to use his long weekend to recover from it.
So, only now a post was added to it..
Not only during large holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in the company.
It seems that they are also available on holidays and bridging days.
It was like this: Last week was the feast of the Assumption of Mary, which in Switzerland is known as "Auffahrt".
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses take a day off, which is why it is semi-official..
There was a long 4- day weekend last week.
What happened last week.
Everywhere there is stress.
Lots of urgent e--mails that had to be out before Easter, orders here, orders there, everything * urgently * before the long Easter weekend.
Because ... because.
Because "next week then" after so much time sounds and that cannot be the case.
or because the people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one.
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also very annoyed.
What is this self--sacrifice for holidays.
For what purpose we have then still holidays, if they cannot be enjoyed properly.
The stress, however, did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite self--reliant.
My question is simply that the Swiss are the only ones who are like this.
This is the reformed- evangelical way.
Or it is also known in the north.
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing is that, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, one can simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer on Hit Radio FFH.
She would get into the festive mood by baking cookies with her son.
"I love it," Catterfeld said.
Until the festive days, she still has a lot of work to do: " For the first time, she has no gifts, she must now finally get started. "
Nekton Bio facilitates a smooth molt and the formation of new feathers.
Nekton Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg of biotin per kilogram.
Nekton Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of the feather damage occurring in the poultry industry is due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage is made of protein--rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein feeding of the bird is necessary for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
The majority of the animal losses that occur during the moult are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of Nekton Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant--based fodder is specifically considered and balanced out.
During the application of Nekton Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
Nekton Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered through the drinking water or the soft food.
Thanks, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
DDR Handicraft model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG / DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Mitteldeutschland, the very rare locomotive comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiasts' magazine Heft 11 / 1968, used with play marks and missing parts, the locomotive is in good working condition. The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal coal trains in the Schlesian network. It is possible that the bauset also comes from the small series manufacturer Zschutschke and Bachmann.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is operational.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive capable of hauling 2,200 tonne coal trains and 530 tonne passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, the DRG decided in March 1926 over the delivery as a 1 'Co + Co 1 ' locomotive with Tatzlager drive from AEG with the delivery of the mechanical parts, and Siemens- Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the future DDR after the war.
In 1946, the locomotives were handed over as reparation to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, all six locomotives were found to be suitable for rehabilitation.
As the electrification of the middle German network progressed, there was a growing need for locomotives for the heavy goods train service. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, with the other locomotives being used as a source of spare parts.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 locomotives in larger numbers were preferred.
As the E 94 was expected not to be able to further increase the workload, the E 95 became the focus of attention for the rehabilitation.
At first, the locomotives were stationed at the Bahnbetriebswerk Leipzig-Wahren.
They came to the Bahnbetriebswerk Halle P in 1960.
They were used in their own circulation plan mostly before coal trains from the Geiseltal heading for Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
So it happened more than once that Schütze got stuck in the switches.
Then the beamann, who was constantly riding on the locomotive with a hammer and a wooden wedge, had to pry the shutter loose while the train was in motion.
Damage to the traction motors occurred more often and led to months- long outages of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new electric locomotives were available and the Reichsbahn did not plan to expand the electrified network, so that the E 95 were withdrawn from service.
In addition to this, the German Reichsbahn wanted to only man the electric locomotives with one person, which would have caused problems in the train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machinery and the poor visibility from the locomotive's cab.
In mid- 1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn from service, followed by the E 95 01 on 5 October 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was never used.
All but the E 95 02 were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was used as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a heating locomotive on the Hauptbahnhof Halle.
It took some time for the authorities at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive was initially cleaned up in order to be able to present it as an exhibit in the RAW Dessau.
She belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden since then as a non- operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is cared for as a museum piece.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on making the locomotive operational.
In April 2015, the locomotive was able to be exhibited for the first time at the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer paint job, where the transformers were inspected and five traction motors were operational.
The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Silesian Mountains Railway and its branch lines, where they proved their reliability and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were moved to Leipzig to the Mitteldeutsche network.
The initial area of operation was Schlesien.
Handcrafted model H0 in OVP, in good working condition, optical repairs to the locomotive are necessary in its own work, it is dusty, with play marks, with the smell of a cellar, a very rare handcrafted model, a very small edition - it is possible that the construction kit also came from the small series firm Zschutschke and Bachmann.
The packaging can have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F- parts are it
I received a bed from them.
However, there were problems with a part of it.
The middle beam is held by two feet, unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What to do now.
I can't put the bed together.
The middle beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended holder.
I also get new ones sent to him.
When they are finally dispatched.
no, it is not flat.
Theses are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones, they were only too narrow.
In any case, it doesn't matter..
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
With me, they are not flat
I could get this sent to him.
Hello #Name#,, I'll explain the problem to him again.
A house fire with two minor injuries and high damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, damage in the six--digit euro range is estimated to have been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport to the adjoining house in Kinsau ( Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with minor smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not suspect arson.
The Kripo of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
It then arrives much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To counter Fake News - Biontech CEO publishes a vaccination photo.
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network " LinkedIn " in early 2021.
Uğur Şahin, the CEO of Biontech, had not made his vaccination status public until now.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to do so, said Şahin.
The CEO and co---founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In the social media, there were false reports that he was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech- Pfizer vaccine. " wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
"For several months, friends have urged him to post a photo of himself being vaccinated to counter the false rumors.
Until now, he has rejected this, because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of his is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe case of Covid-19 and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, it seems, is fear, which is often fuelled by misinformation and mistrust. "
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences..
The Internet is circulating an interview with Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as also the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"At the moment, it is not legal for him to get the vaccine himself, said Şahin at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted, and the Biontech CEO has had himself vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in the transformer station: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine- Westphalia the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralyzed an electrical substation.
After a fire with severe damage to an electricity substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district of North Rhine- Westphalia in Germany had to go without electricity for 24 hours.
Driven by the fire on Friday evening, 41,000 residents and residents were left in the dark in several communities.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday, many emergency generators were in operation until the large---scale disruption was finally repaired in the late evening.
Firefighters and volunteers and volunteers from the THW provided assistance in the municipalities.
The authorities set up care places in schools and called on neighbors to help.
The supplier thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
They are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
They also thanked the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their unremitting efforts, said the head of the department of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage would still take several days, as the Westnetz workers were only able to temporarily reopen some of the lines, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
The current flows again
The fire, which broke out on Friday at 19:15, had damaged parts of the 10,000 volt switching station in Neunkirchen- Seelscheid according to Westnetz.
Detailed cleaning and repair work was needed.
Parallel to this, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply has been restored.
Since Saturday 18:00, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen- Seelscheid were gradually connected from 21:30.
Since 23:15, also the last ones affected by the power outage also had electricity..
More than 80 workers from Westnetz and partner firms were involved.
After the installation of emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborly assistance.
"The most important thing now is that the citizens in their neighborhoods take care of elderly or single people and report to the local fire station when help is needed, explained Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus of the setting up and operation of emergency generators was on the residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to information from the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who were not able to care for themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Hello.
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
I can buy them there and pay in euros.
This is the blue-green bed cover #PRS- Org #.
I hope they also had a nice day and stay healthy ♡
However, he cannot mount the substructure on the tabletop.
It is Custom # Name #.
There are three variants.
They wanted those with table plates with a diameter of #Number #.
They have a diameter of 155 cm.
Today came his #PRS Organization #, but he cannot put them together and thus shorten them.
He can help me further with that.
Otherwise, he would have to send them back, since they are not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would appreciate a response.
That's really easier.
Then we'll do it that way.
Send it to me by mail.
The repairs are now complete..
He had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, the E- #PRS # had not been restarted.
Should I do this now.
Such a low reimbursement is almost insulting.
With this, they are not in agreement.
Nordic Combination: Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have reached the podium in the sprint at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo was again beaten by the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a large lead after the ski jump in the Loipe.
Return of the order number # Number #

They have both been rebuilt and are using version 4.5.
it could be that they have already heard of the problem.
He directly bought a book from his PRS Organization, it seems that it is also about it.
If I try to open it, the message comes up, ups.
This document could not be opened.
The file may be flawed and should be reported to the customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS- Org # epub file.
They can help me further.
Chat Connection is gone and now what.

In order for the color to be applied evenly and cleanly, the parts should be cleaned with some soap and water of dust, grease and fingerprints, rinsed with clear water and dried.
Before the brush touches the model for the first time with a new color, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
This can be done on the inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first stroke on the part.
He applies the brush in a uniform manner, stroke by stroke.
The slight overlap of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid rapid back and forth wiping with the brush.
As a result, unrealistically shaped areas are created.
A model is not a fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could later shine through.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come at the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metallic streaks can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Leave the painted parts to dry for a day before dismantling them.
The original appearance of the models is achieved through the decals or the Abziehbilder.
From the insignia on aircraft to ship names, the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Put the decals in the right order while the parts are still easy to reach.
The cockpit of a plane can be easier to stick on before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool, such as scissors, tweezers and toothpick, is time, patience and a steady hand when it comes to gluing.
Cut each required decal individually and lay them out.
Decals are also known as water- slide pictures because the back of the decal is moistened with water until the backing paper darkens.
Then he moves the picture only a little bit from the paper and puts the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which he has also previously moistened).
Whilst the decal is attached to the model with a tool, the backing paper is pulled to the side.
Caution: one must first check whether the picture is sitting correctly on the paper before completely removing it, so that it does not stick to the finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Using a household cloth to absorb excess water.
Warning: not suitable for children under the age of 3.
He can only open a book for a short time when he looks at something else, then he can no longer read the book and has to re-register and re-register and the book has to be reloaded and he has to search for the place where he stopped reading.
On Saturday, he had already communicated with them.
If I receive it by email.
Also for all 3 packages.
However, the lamp came in three separate packages to him.
after all, many thanks.
Then, when the money is returned, I will buy elsewhere.
It will be easy for me to get it back.
Fertility treatment at the PKV / what a "versicherungsfall" is.
Hi everyone,
They had been in fertility treatment for some time, but now, when it comes to the reimbursement from the PKV, this suddenly stands in the way.
In the order of
They had applied for the IVF procedure with the PKV in advance and received the go-- ahead after three attempts.
The experiments were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to the successful pregnancy and birth and was reimbursed by the PKV.
A few years later, they tried to have a second child, and underwent two (unsuccessful) pregnancies, but did not yet include these in their calculations with the PKV.
They applied again for the costs to be reimbursed by the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After several more attempts ( they have more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones are reimbursed by the PKV ) they submitted the bills to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise that instead of 5 attempts ( 2 + 3 ) the PKV would only reimburse 3 attempts.
The justification: With the pregnancy or birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first acceptance are annulled.
The second child is a new insurance case.
However, according to the AGB, "the insurance case begins with the healing treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists. "
The questions to the experts in the round here are as follows:
* Who is right here, the PKV ( only three attempts are reimbursed ) or us ( five attempts are reimbursed ).
* The PKV should have had to warn that with a birth, the further attempts would be forfeited.
* The desire for a second child is really a new insurance case.
The unfruitfulness ( caused by the closed fallopian tubes ) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Many thanks already for their help.
They should send him the three variants by email and tell him how to get them back.
Okay.
We will no longer order anything from them.
If they add up the sales of me and his friend # Name # ( same address ) they have obviously lost good customers.
They can pass this on to their manager without hesitation.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told him that the reimbursement was initiated and now they say that he has to send the thing back first.
I can't be held responsible for the fact that the commode is completely disoriented in his presence.
Looking at the screenshot, the colleague wrote:
It is clear and unambiguous that the repayment was ordered and that he has still not received any repayment from the PRS.
They can inform their manager that they have lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various pieces of furniture for their apartment through his account..
They will no longer do this..
No, the defect did not appear until several months later.
A chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell him as a desk chair.
Whatever the case,, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible to obtain another type of packaging.
He will dismantle the wardrobe and hand it over to the transport company in such a way that it can be transported.
Good day, I have a question about their series of #PRS-ORG#.
These products are advertised with additional seats, but they cannot be found at this location.
They can help.
Theme of the Week: The best low budget films
What a low- budget film is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A low- budget film or low- budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are plenty of lists of low- budget films on the Internet,, such as on Letterboxd.com.
They know interesting representatives of this category.
What attracts them to it.
And what they like, and what they don't like at all.
He is a very good customer of them, has already furnished two apartments completely with their furniture.
Wanted to find out the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, it is now also reliable.
Many thanks
With friendly greetings
There is no telephone number, a chat where one has to wait for 30 minutes is not a chat.
Unfortunately, nothing has changed in the waiting position ... I will then soon give up again, because it simply does not work here.
Hello
A "half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU.
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a " half victory " in the conflict with the Belarussian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Agency (EPA).
Sustainably, the EU has not solved the confrontation, said the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP).
This state of suspension - Belarus does not give up completely, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong.
It appears that there is a " growing normalization of pushbacks " by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not taken a stance against it, it goes to the detriment of the fundamental rights.
This development also weakened the cohesion in the Union.
"She cannot get her way when a member state decides to do its own thing, as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU border agency Frontex to have access to the border.
In addition, the EU pays a price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong, as a basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line " border guard, border guard, border guard " has been strengthened.
Second attempt to cross the border.
According to Poland's Border Guard, migrants have attempted to cross into Polish territory from Belarus again.
55 migrants were detained and returned to the border overnight on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were attacked by the migrants with stones near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday night, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard measures and extraterritorial sanctions. "
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarussian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus routinely transports thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after the controversial Formula 1 final.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is based on an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he allegedly overtook illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and won his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre occurred shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase in which the Dutch driver ahead of him had overtaken.
I check it.
He speaks to the bank and reports back to them.
thanks for the support.

Verstappen celebrates with 24 years at the Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi his first World Championship title with an overtaking maneuver against Hamilton in the final round. dpa
He had already had a huge argument with them when he ordered the #PRS Org # commode.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim".
As part of the " LiteraTour Nord " reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel " Daheim " on Friday in the sold- out Blue Note and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
Yesterday, he filed a contact form for the return of an article, but did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
His question was whether his request had been accepted.
Not everyone has the time for his ridiculous chat and the poorly delivered Chinese junk he delivers..
Their mistake, which they rectify and not all from their household.
They contacted Mrs. # Name #.
I can't chat with them every day.
Yesterday they had chatted and agreed that he or Mrs. #Name # would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a new order of the # PRS Org # bedside table and a return label.
This e--mail has not been received so far..
The package wants to deliver to #PRS Org today.
Please contact me
With friendly greetings
The Lok Sound 5 Decoder can handle up to 10 channels at the same time.
Each channel can be recorded with up to 16 bits and 31,250 kHz and offers finally HiFi quality on their equipment.
It is practically impossible to hear any difference to the original.
A Class D audio amplifier with up to 3 watts of output power controls the speakers, which must have an impedance between 4 and 32 ohms.
The huge 128 Mbit sound memory provides enough capacity.
All the individual sounds can be individually adjusted in terms of volume.
The super- flexible Soundengine without a rigid timetable allows for the realistic simulation of all conceivable railway vehicles.
Three separate, individually adjustable braking functions and two alternative load scenarios give them the maximum control over their vehicles.
SORry but that doesn't mean anything because he says he is not an antisemite.
It's like when an AfD politician says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it..
But Kollegah reproduces constantly some anti--Semitic messages.
If one wants to distance oneself, it should be done completely.
If that's the case, he is just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Someone who seriously questions the theory of evolution is completely lost.
For this reason, God has set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as he becomes a creationist, he must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is nothing but nonsense.
And that makes him an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be placed as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic and achromatic lens system allows for practically error- free use of the microscope up to the edge of the field of view.
Frequently, magnifying lenses are marked with magnification figures.
However, these figures only apply to exactly defined conditions, which seldom correspond to the use conditions.
In order to be able to use their magnifying glass optimally, they are asked to take into account the indications in the table " Technical data " (see the instructions in the packaging).
On the surface of the lens of all optical instruments – including telescopes – light reflections occur.
By using an antireflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
Under optimal use conditions – the telescope is held close to the eye – reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
More information is available in the accompanying instruction manual (in German and English).
Zeiss VisuCard Lupe Scheckkartenlupe Vergrößeration magnifying glass.
The Zeiss VisuCard can be used as a reading aid while on the move or simply for the everyday minutiae, as it can be taken anywhere because of its handy format.
and their hard shell makes them resistant to particular stresses of everyday life.
Each microscope comes with a check card case for the safe storage and transportation.
They offer these parts, which they show in the pictures or which are described under "What they offer "
In what condition the offered item is in.
Everyone can, of course, once overlook something, because no one is free from errors - if this ever happens, it is enough to send a message and it will be settled to everyone's satisfaction (e.g. by exchanging, a partial reimbursement or a complete reimbursement).
They receive a proper bill of account.
The shipment is always sent, unless the buyer specifically requests otherwise, insured with a shipment number by DHL.
The individual shipping costs can be deduced from the above shipping conditions.
There are no additional handling costs.
Okay, they say all authorized, I can check more precisely.

#PRS Org # will do a very nice and good service, although it took a long time to get to a person, they were super.
Hello, # PRS-Org # Team.
I had already reported to them under the Kundenkontakt with the number #Phonenumber #.
Yes,, but it was called before..
They cannot deliver from England because of #PRS Org #.
Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women search for Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many strange situations during the Christmas tree sale.
Once, a man even drove home alone after a disagreement with his partner.
Every year he plants more than 2000 of them..
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many strange situations.
This makes the pre--Christmastime always a little funny, he says.
And with the voucher.
Otherwise, I will leave as a customer.
After all, I received a defective delivery and had to pay the full price for it.
Then I will also rate it accordingly.
There is no need for discussions about the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And so both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be the "Dreher", which is nowhere near as tasty sounding.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan / Magic.
They have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, he now has problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, he had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit without any problems, except for a few failures.
The new fibre connection sends 500 Mbit to the Fritz Box 7590 and the DLAN module connected to the Fritz Box also receives these.
However, at the other DLan module, which transmits the Wi-Fi signal,, the full 500 does not come in, but the more he moves away from the module with the signal, the less comes in (i.e. a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fibre connection in the first floor is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLAN, but there were also similar large losses.
Someone could explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the electricity cable.
and LAN is really the only solution.
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really at a loss as to why he has set up an extra account for himself..
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the current account.
Those who had thought that now there would be peace at the Girokonten are disappointed.
Whilst many banks have used the autumn to trick their customers into confirming the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, they have also lowered the exemption thresholds for negative interest rates.
The German Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
She has now halved the allowance and quadrupled the daily allowance.
In the first step, the border was only lowered for customers of the Postbank subsidiary - to 50,000 euros for Giro and Anlagekonten and 25,000 euros for Tagesgeldkonten.
However, these lower thresholds now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
and not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros before, which still applies, as well as at the ING Deutschland.
The cost--conscious customers' favourite direct bank DKB has lowered the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
After all: more than 100 banks now have a freebet of 25,000 euros or less, according to the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank Berlin is also at 25,000 euros. However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer associations, which won the first instance before the Berlin Landgericht against this regulation.
Already, the banks are discussing the possibility of establishing reserves - in the event that the upper courts declare the negative interest rates in general to be unlawful and many millions of bank customers have to be reimbursed.
Instead of the table for 6 persons, the table for 8 persons was delivered.
The undergallery is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole Beauty Army
She is now officially at the head of Hollywood..
But their lives are like a rollercoaster..
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who in 2021 caused a stir with the " Friends " reunion and the continuation of her series " The Morning Show " , this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of her appearance..
After all, she allows herself one chip a day (i.e. a single chip from the bag).
It is a miracle that they still manage to win the hearts of female and male fans alike.
Perhaps because she has simply bad luck with the luck, and is still looking for the great love.
and the baby wish from the list has been crossed off.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked about it have no idea what's going on with me medically, why I can't do it.
It was really hurtful.
It is hoped that success and fame will also bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen has to give up.
Kimi Räikkönen's retirement from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - the 42- year old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a technical error and a slight bandage touch, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after only half of the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix that the "Iceman" ended his career in the Motorsport King's Class.
He was also accompanied by his wife Minttu and the two children to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in the Ferrari in 2007.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich won his 60th World Cup victory – Nolte won the two--man bob – Sport
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's mark of 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I've done the calculations, he would have to win nine and a half races per season to make it to Cortina 2026. The double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg achieved two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he defended the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second, going from third place to first.
Then he adjusted the material setting a little and won with 0.30 seconds on Sunday with a bigger lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis ( SV Halle ), Candy Bauer ( BSC Oberbärenburg ) and Alexander Schüller ( SV Halle ) he set himself ahead of the Briton Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd victory in a row.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was competing for Stuttgart, moved up to fifth place from second place previously.
Christoph Hafer from the BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he did differently, I would also do it that way," Lochner said.
Nolte with a home victory - a podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third season victory in the women's two--man bob on her home track.
After finishing fourth in the Monobob the previous day, she raced to the World Cup victory with pusher Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Olympian Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She recorded her first podium finish in this winter's competition.
The Wiesbaden athlete Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was super cool to finish on the podium for the first time in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama took me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay, said Burghardt and emphasized that "it is not just pushing, but there is also a lot of work around it".
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely error--free rides, but said: "It is going in the right direction.".
I had the Deck already in the shopping cart and could now buy it.
What to do.
He has not received it and therefore has not been able to redeem it, which is why he has finally asked about it.
Due to the coronavirus, he had other problems last year and never had time for it.
And now he was said to have run out, which made me very angry.
They were discussing the Asare seat in the chat.
I want to return it and then order it again, since it is currently on sale.
Why the shipment was only started on 16 March.
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on their website.
No, only when you type it in comes an extra field with the message.
It was taken away from her by her colleague yesterday.
Why it is a problem today
I have also sent them pictures of the wrongly delivered Ware.
But they still want the shelf module, just a new, undamaged one.
and not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY.
Hello, dear wonderful women and girls and women,
I have a lot of things that he simply wants to write down and perhaps it goes for the one or the other as well..
He is 24 years old, he has kPTBS, a full--time student and a dog mother - despite the fact that his dog does not scream or go to the kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 his child.
My friend (who has been together for 6 years) is ill, suffered a second- degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years ( but is now in therapy ).
He visited him yesterday because he also has emotional needs and because he wants to see and feel him, they have cuddled a lot and it was nice.
He helped him in the shower (because his hand was in a bandage due to burns).
He is also cold and they see each other less (1-2 times a week) which is difficult for him because of his needs for affection and love.
My puppy has just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cushioned blanket and has relaxed a bit after the heat lamp and stroking were there for him.
He lives alone with his sister and his mother, who is away for a month.
And now they also have to do housework, which they divide between them.
Even cooking is a lot of work for me right now.
My post--traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is currently in a good state of health, he is halfway through therapy and is coping well.
It's not good, but I get by and is almost symptom- free.
My university is demanding a lot of me right now (for him), tomorrow at 3 p.m. he has a written test for which he has not prepared anything and the next day he has an anatomy class for which he should have prepared something.
And next week, he has an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in his calendar and not in his head because there is no space left in his head because it is full.
My week goes like this: Only until the next day, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on.
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Until the end of the month.
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental anchors, because otherwise I won't be able to do it.
In some way, I feel guilty and chaotic, but in a different way, I can't do it any other way.
It's the same for me too.
Earnestly, I am eternally grateful that he does not have to work.
Really unendlessly grateful, I can't put it into words.
I don't know if he would have survived otherwise.
I think that this also has something to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought that here she would find fellow sufferers.
I wish them at least a restful evening, the week is almost over.
Today, he has received his order, unfortunately, the whole thing is a different color, the surface is scratched and the table legs have imprints.
In the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
They are very disappointed.
What they can offer me.
If they now change the table, I will get another color or something like that.
The cancellation email was sent on 26 December #Number #.
In other words, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
It was completely different back then in school, that many religion teachers did not believe in God and it was just another subject for them like maths or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps because he was christianly educated and he always somehow believed in it.
As for me, ...
Maybe he can also tell stories from his work and/ or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, he understands the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to separate them.
There is also a curriculum and so on.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity..
What leads one to want to teach religion if they do not believe in it.
preserving culture or something like that.
I hope his question is not too personal.
If it cannot be changed or not, it is written in English, which he also understands well.
This has been going on for a long time, then I would avoid it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response within a short time, at the latest by the beginning of the next week.
Thanks for their support #Name #.
Help, I'm looking for a film.
Hello, dear people,
He is looking for a film from his childhood (he is 24).
I believe it was a film for young people.
In the film, there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the Modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead (not quite sure).
Since it is not possible to describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a situation is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Reich of the Dead who wants to bring the woman to the Reich of the Dead so that he can live on his own.
The transition is probably also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, the two soldiers probably fight against each other.
If anyone knows what it means, they are welcome to tell me.
Since Week 1, Our Little One has only slept on its belly.
Fast forward is still alive.
Relax.
A child can withstand much more than one thinks.
Ensuring that everything around it is in order, no cuddly toys, going in more often to check, but no minutes of surveillance.
This makes him crazy.
Fresh air in the room.
A good mattress.
No cushions.
And Achso and their had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe his child when it sleeps.
Turning the head to the side.
It can lift itself up from the belly.
Or it lies face down in the mattress.
This can be used to determine whether everything is in order.
We have also all grown up, and when my husband was born, it was common to put the children to sleep on their stomachs.
In addition, they are already "stammkunde" with them and have already bought many articles.
But why they only offered him 20 euros.
Hello, he wrote to a colleague of theirs yesterday and has not yet received a response.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday ( order number # Alphanumeric ID #).
The right shelf does not fit in the cupboard.
I ask him to contact him as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not in use..
In order to make it clear,.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, he himself knows that not everything can be held up.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
However, it is simply the case that the politics of this station are now under all sorts of pressure.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok, but then to go on a large begging tour at the same time).
It was said to be an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Arno said that he did not want "to be a permanent billboard".
What one is now.
A 0815 advertising channel that tries to sell its Billo merchandise to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts..
These rules apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, the people can continue to be insulted.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and who, at the expense of the action with the exploded rented premises, tries to make a mess of the ashes.
It's hard to find the good in all of this.
It's great if he likes it, I find it horrible.
I ask for a return call, as his delivered wooden table was defective.
Corpus breakdown due to damaged delivery of the #PRS Org #.
As a consoler for stomach aches or just for cuddling, my little warm friend can be used in many different ways.
Chestnut kernel cushions are a traditional home remedy for soothing warmth, as chestnut kernels can absorb and release warmth very well.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft covering makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they are not feeling well.
The chestnut husk cushion with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following areas of application:
Before heating the cushion, it is necessary to check it for untypical smell, stock or burn marks and dispose of it immediately if they are present.
The inner cushion must be removed from the cover before heating.
In a microwave oven at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (as indicated by the microwave oven manufacturer)
After heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it.
Then the inner cushion is put back into the cover.
During the first heating, there may be a slight formation of moisture at the surface, which disappears after repeated applications.
They must adhere to the indicated heating instructions, since longer heating times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage ( risk of ignition and burning ) .
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, one should check that the heating of grain products is allowed by the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner cushion was placed back in the cover, the temperature of the cushion was checked for suitability for babies (maximum 43 °C) on the arm.
The pillow is not to be used in cases of acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulation problems, fresh haematomas, blood clots and open wounds, as well as for persons with reduced pain sensitivity.
In the case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases, as well as pregnancy, one should consult a doctor before using it.
If the seams have opened up and loose kernels have escaped, the product and the loose kernels should be disposed of immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child during the application should be regularly monitored to exclude overheating.
All serious incidents related to the product are to be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user resides.
The cover is removable and washable at 30 °C in the washing machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product.
Darmstadt after the Hinserie Second – Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the football Bundesliga.
In the meantime, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
For Ingolstadt, things are also not going well under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
If the battery is broken.
Yesterday evening, his laptop ( a ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer powered by his power supply.
This was bought new about 5 months ago, so it should still work..
I thought that the power supply alone would be enough to operate.
The battery is empty and the laptop won't start even though the power supply is plugged in.
He then removed the battery, but still nothing happened.
Maybe they have some ideas.
A new battery has been ordered, but why the laptop cannot be used in net mode.
If something else is broken.
Many thanks for their help.
I want the #PRS Org # to be delivered to the room..
How to book it.
I'm interested in the #PRS Org # chair..
I don't know how high the seat is.
Often on tour and yet with a lot of luggage.
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem.
The 20 litre capacity can accommodate larger photography equipment without problems, which can be safely stowed in the padded FlexFold divider.
And what else he needs for everyday use is kept well organized and separated from the photo equipment thanks to the practical accesses in the individually configurable interior..
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has a lot to offer - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed several highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpacks and yet provide quick access to the photographic equipment within seconds.
This can be done in two ways: conventionally through the hatch cover, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, a well- thought out solution for effective protection, which has already proved its effectiveness in the Messenger Bags.
In the closure flap, there is a metal closure hook with corresponding anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken into account different " fill levels " - there are four anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be inserted.
If the rucksack is full, he takes the top beam, if it is empty, a lower one.
The hinges and hooks are also magnetic.
This also allows the rucksack to be closed reliably, without the hook becoming jammed.
The second possibility fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: in addition to the hinged lid, there are two zipper openings on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from the top - it is no longer necessary to wade through the contents.
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enormously: if he not only carries his photography equipment, but also everyday objects or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, the interior can be individually configured (more below) and so both of them can be separated from each other and accessed independently through the two side openings.
In addition, he can pull the backpack from the right side of the body towards the body, for example to reach the camera equipment in the right main compartment while the everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Comfortable and uncomplicated adjustable straps help with this..
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry, even if a trip to Scotland is planned in the autumn.
Unfortunately, he is waiting in vain for the email from his support.
#Name # has sent me yesterday an email as confirmation of the appointment.
Contact from the shipping company announcing the pick-up of the wrongly delivered table.
Untill now, no message has been received..
I ask for immediate action.
He has already written to the third support employee, in none of them he got further than the promise that he would receive a letter as confirmation.
This is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom # Name #
It is impossible to say when the wardrobe will be delivered again.
It is not an option for me to keep him in this way.
It works.
Many, many thanks for the help
He also wished them a pleasant evening.
Hello, my order number is # Number #. when the article will be delivered.
The order and payment was made on January 12, 2021.
He was delivered a completely different lamp than he ordered.
I want to be called in.
If they give him the extension, he will immediately order a larger order, but at least he has kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that the previous year turned out differently than expected, he could not foresee and has not been able to resolve and clarify it in time.
But the damage was done as a customer, and that he does not accept.
Rotinger brake pads are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who values reliability and safety when braking, even in difficult conditions..
Rotinger brake discs are cast and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All the tinted sheets are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain sheets and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which focuses on the widening of the glass after the characteristics of the original mounting.
These getuned discs, produced in this way, ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the window, while the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake pads and brake blocks.
The aesthetic qualities of their tuned screens emphasize the character of each car by their attractive and eye--catching appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man on the southern branch of the American River discovered a glowing rock in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and led to the so-called " California Gold Rush " of 1849.
Thousands came from near and far to make Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were marked off, tents were set up, saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight..
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust" ( Coloma or Bankruptcy ).
In this game, the player is a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the west and wants to make a name for himself.
He will be looking for gold, recruiting workers, gathering horses and establishing businesses.
He will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river flows and surrounding areas.
He is not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea.
He must outperform his fellow pioneers in order to not go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
They simultaneously choose their actions, have to manage their resources and build a tableau that works more and more for them (so--called "engine building").
The buildings on his tableau allow him to become more efficient, gain additional actions or turn the rules in his favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, he can develop his individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma covers a period of three years, from 1848 ( the year the gold was discovered in Coloma ) to 1849 ( the year of the California Gold Rush ) and 1850 ( the year California became an official state ).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is uncovered and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a lock.
This deactivates the first half of the location, reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions have been completed, the pioneers return.
The Anpreiser rotates at the beginning of each round to a new location, thereby changing the available actions.
This continues until the Anpreiser has moved five times, thus covering each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the player Coloma must defend against an attack by enraged bandits.
If the players have supplied enough Revolverhelden and the bandits are numerically superior, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is made.
The player with the most victory points wins.

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse and power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in his Twitter timeline today, and he immediately watched it.
The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children are Tyrannies " (2008), he started a heated debate on child rearing.
Former patients and guardians have now raised serious accusations against him.
Please look after themselves, the film is difficult to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other caregivers must never, never, never have power over the child.
The goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
It still gives me the shivers..
Holetschek said that the states were discussing the abolition of the test obligation for triple vaccinated people.
The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting whether to abolish the testing obligation for triple vaccinated people nationwide.
"The countries need clarity quickly on whether and when, for three times vaccinated people, the testing obligation can be lifted, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU, chairman of the Conference of Ministers of Health) to Bild am Sonntag.
The removal of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people was "not only medically justified, but also provided an additional incentive to vaccinate. " said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will present a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on the following Tuesday. "- AFP
And I want the lamp back.
How to proceed in this case.
Hello, I find the #PRS Org # chair very beautiful,, however, he cannot see how high the seat is.
He can help me further.
He can no longer make any purchases through his #PRS Org #.
Oops, a mistake has been made.
Purchases can be made through the #PRS Org # website on the computer.
He has updated his contact details.
This could be due to the following reasons.
What he describes is called * awareness *, which means sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
They occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common experience is hearing sounds or voices, less often seeing pictures, and very rarely feeling pain.
Cesarean sections are operations that are associated with a higher rate of awareness, as they avoid a deep anesthesia in order to protect the child until the placenta is detached.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anaesthetic briefing.
Certain anaesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), involve a slight increase in risk.
** Edit:Loved ones, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, however, u / Nitemarex did not have it by definition.
She misinterpreted his comment.
However, the chair is defective.
The 20 euros, however, are of no help..
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the broken chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the e-commerce sector.
They should at least take back the broken chair..
They sell the second chair privately.
They also lose a lot of money.
He had already sent them a letter, which they had not responded to.
The question again.
The order and the bill state that the goods will be delivered to a room of the buyer's choice.
The carrier is Firma # Name #.
He had just called there..
He told me that they only deliver to the front door - because of # PRS Organization #.
This is the case.
If yes, he must cancel the order, since he does not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
I won't be called..
He had formulated a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
He has established himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97..
There is still the new book on the table, fresh from the press: "An old man is getting older".
The shattering diary of a slow farewell from the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby declare his life--long gratitude.".

Roulades tips and tricks
A week ago, he had received many good tips for the perfect goulash.
There was it at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery.
And thanks for that as well.
Now he has got the taste for it and wants to cook roast meat for New Year's Eve for the first time.
Tomorrow, I will make a cow's bone broth..
Otherwise, they have other tips for him.
Note that he does not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What happens next.
What to do with the books and how to get them back to the PRS.
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I will manage it.
IEs is asking for a refund of €#Number #.

Where in the Lübeck area there is still Christmas roast.
For many people, the goose or duck is part of the Christmas holidays like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
They have not yet procured any poultry.
Now the time is running out..
They reveal to them where they can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and the fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the Volume, Gain and Master Volume controls, they can, on the one hand, set the desired volume and, on the other, the distortion level of their sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series have a unique power level regulator, which allows the sound level to be reduced without altering the "gains" and distortion.
Above, it was already hinted at that with the Power Level Regulator, one can even create a power reserve, if it suddenly gets too loud.
Thanks to the Power Level Regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulator, so that even with the use of headphones or direct recordings, the listener gets an eminently " acoustic " impression.
To the AUX jack, a CD or MP3 player can be connected, so that they can jam to their favorite songs.
There is also a tuner on board, so they do not need a separate tuner.
With the addition of a VFS5 foot taster, the sounds can also be called for by foot, the effect blocks can be switched on and off, and the tempo of the effects that are compatible in this way can be tapped.
For live use, this is practically indispensable.
With its new power packs, Vox is taking another step into the future.
However, he had the same experience with other people.
Then there is the possibility of sending the lamp back.
As they are for over an Esstisch too low to hang.
And I would like to send them back..
He can help me further with that.
and the commode.
In the next few weeks, they will receive an update on the exact delivery date.
Hello, they have already sat on the PRS org chairs.
If it is not possible, he would be satisfied with a legacy or a discount.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture..
More than 1,000 euros for goods that he does not need is still too much.
He has just received his delivery and wanted to know whether screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS- Org # Spiegel ( Door ) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait has not been worth it.

Iran sees progress in negotiations over a nuclear agreement
According to Iranian reports, there are signs of progress in the negotiations over the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues to be discussed on the agenda for the day, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency IRNA.
This is a "positive and important development," since at the beginning there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a short interruption.
The negotiations are attended by Iranian, German, British, Chinese, French and Russian under-secretaries.
A US delegation is also in Vienna for the negotiations, but is only indirectly involved.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony - the Free State is now the Bundesland with the highest Corona infection rate.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the country.
As the only state, the value exceeds the mark of 1000.
As the only state, Thuringia exceeded the mark of 1000 on the Corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven--day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had the highest infection rate in the country for the last time, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia was slightly lower than the value of 1,000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new cases of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 severely ill patients with Covid-19 were being treated in intensive care.
On weekends, there can be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health departments have been overburdened for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand..
Since the delivery is scheduled for the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, that's it or so.
here, he does not have to do anything further.
That's exactly what he wants to avoid, that's why he writes to me.
I would like to have the return on his own expense.
A return fee of 8 euros is in my opinion an outrage.
It's time for changes
The Bundestag has welcomed me, and I am u / Strator DE in the plenary chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day.
#Why the post here.
If one takes a look at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, one can see that it is non---existent.
They are in a winter slump and have extended the summer gap for several months.
#Where the problem lies.
And that's what it was all about.
For the most part, this is probably due to dissatisfaction with the way things have gone, how things have been handled, and the general state of affairs.
In the last few days, the impression has emerged that many here still really want to go to the MBundestag.
#What needs to be changed
At this point, the community around the MBundestag that wants to keep it alive is called upon.
The impetus came from u / edizVEvo, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and found a simple pile of rubble in front of it.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, he also wants to call on everyone to participate, only then this project can continue to exist in the future.
They have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which they can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
The server can be joined through this link.
Goals
How the MBundestag should function in the future.
* Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed.
* How they should present themselves to the outside world in the future.
* How new members are to be recruited.
* How to create a fair election system.
I'm pretty sure that he has forgotten a lot of things, but that is not a big deal, since they have the Discord at the end.
If they have the desire and the time, they should come to the Discord, work with and let them decide democratically about the future.
He has ordered a lamp shade from them, which is still being delivered..
Now, I see that the article is too big or clumsy for this and that it is not suitable for his taste.
For this, he has already ordered another hanging at them.
He put it together and noticed this when he took the soft foam.
He is very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and that he will get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #Name # is much darker than expected.
He also has a question: the day blanket #PRS- Org # is also available in oversize, in 240 x 240, for example.
#PRS Org # must be able to guarantee that the faulty shelf will be removed as soon as possible.
and I ask them to do that now.
A suitable packaging has not been found, the shelves will be dismantled as far as possible for the pick-up - it is up to #PRS Org # to figure out how that can be done.
#PRS Org # can contact him telephonically at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
There is an instruction for the installation.
How much time he had to get these or decide whether to return them.
How they respond to the question of why they are vegan.
Today, he had a conversation with a colleague whom he likes..
She herself has lived for a while on a vegetarian diet and eats meat very rarely nowadays.
He himself was also a vegetarian for several years.
On being asked whether he had always wanted to be vegan, and that vegetarianism had been a planned stepping stone, he replied honestly.
and that he thought for a long time that as a vegetarian he was supporting animal welfare, but eventually realized and understood that he was in fact supporting animal cruelty.
This is why he decided to become vegan.
In that moment, the impression was that there was a feeling of resentment on their side, they then defended vegetarianism and said they knew where their meat came from and that as a vegetarian they reduced the suffering of animals.
Now, I wonder if his answer to " plump " was correct.
How they answered the question.
The feeling is that as a vegan, one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise, without the intention to do so.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is not an exception to § 312d BGB.
Their #PRS Organization # does not exempt them from the legal requirements for long--distance sales.
On the assigned date, on the day #PRS Org# picks up his return, he is not present.
As he could not be there in person due to a funeral, he could not change this either.
I would like to be assigned an alternative pick-up time.
From the 01.02.# Number #, he will be available again on a full--time basis.
The Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue is equipped with 45,000 euros from the state.
Recently, the Rhineland- Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz handed over a subsidy of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire brigade of Lahnstein in the Lahnstein town hall to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland- Palatinate is supporting them in this way, says Lahnsteins mayor Peter Labonte.
The rescue boat is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland- Palatinate.
Above and below the water, they carry out tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected that the number of incidents will increase permanently: the boom in the hotel shipping on the Rhine and the Moselle and the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
He had bought a book that he could only read 10% of, and then the problems started.
He cannot open the book..
She has followed her recommendations but has synchronized, removed and reloaded the app, nothing has worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole thing has taken up a lot of time and he is now hoping for help.
Okay, that's how it is..
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS Org # for June.
In the ordering process, it is possible to specify a date.
According to the ANSI / Plato FL1 standard, the previously mentioned values were measured in the Fenix laboratory at 21 °C ± 3 ° C, 50% - 80% air humidity and the built-in 275 mAh LiPo battery.
The values can vary depending on the used flashlight, age and environment.
The burn time in the stage of Hell includes the burn time with reduced brightness due to the overheating protection.

Thanks first and foremost for the fact that he puts himself in the middle of the whole thing here, I has also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar capacity, i.e. he was also a weapons bearer in the Executive, and he doesn't want to go into it any further.
The question of right and left is always oversimplified.
In general, one should say that the state employee comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary Left, which should be obvious to everyone.
Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that people on the right of the conservative spectrum are magically attracted to the uniforms and weapons of these people, and that these people then have a hard time dealing with the lived reality, which should also be clear to everyone, because, in addition to the average White, there are now many Germans with a migrant background, women and homosexuals (and this does not refer to the exaggeratedly feminine stereotype of gay men, but rather to normal men and women who do not make it obvious that they are gay) and also on these people can and must rely on him, because in the event of doubt, they save his life or set this aside for him.
But even these marginal groups represent a conservative attitude, according to my experience, which means that they are proud of Germany and feel that they are not represented by overbearing left--wing politics, even though this politics pretends to be on their side, and they want to be treated as normal people.
Returning to the right, since the police and the armed forces are also a cross- section of society, there are also extreme right-wingers there, but that they are allowed to openly express their opinions there or even to hatch plans that threaten the state is overblown in the media and also irritates him.
Naturally, it happens that police officers and soldiers, who are often deployed abroad, begin to stereotype and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that right--thinking friends meet and engage in a vigorous exchange of ideas..
Nevertheless, such things are well combated and countered with political education and enlightenment.
Germany is so deeply intertwined with the rest of the world, and that is a good thing in my opinion, that it is not possible for them to have genuine racists and Nazis in their ranks.
yes, what I don't understand is that the other basket has also been ordered from the German side.
Why this should come from England.
When he ordered, it was not sold out.
I had already ordered in November..
It was confirmed to me in the confirmation of the order, however.
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I had previously chatted with #Name#.
Alternatively, the other #PRS- Org # Korb for # Number # Euros in black could be delivered to Germany, or this Korb is available somewhere in Germany.
He always finds only one partner company..
But at the top of the wooden part there are two deep grooves, which were filled with something yellow.
and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch.
Ordinary by Child
Hello, a 32--year old man has a problem that has been bothering him for a long time.
At work, he is very disciplined and organised ( is self--employed and has very little leisure time ), but he has struggled to keep his house clean and tidy for most of his life.
There are always phases in which everything lies dormant, and then and again, it catches him and he cleans up and cleans.
But it is never so that someone could spontaneously come to visit..
My husband is (unsurprisingly) also not better, it annoys her somewhat, but she usually loses out to work and disinterest.
The kitchen is still the most frequently cleaned because they like to cook.
Now to his question, they have managed to become more organised with their children.
We don't have one yet, but they are working on it and this question has been on his mind for a long time.
However, for me, there is no incentive, it does not bother him so much as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
With a child, one has a greater incentive or remains lazy.
I'm looking forward to their responses.
The exclusive, new, and qualitatively high--quality and anatomically preformed cut offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit, and allows for a nearly unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-forming with special, further pressing at the joints for improved freedom of movement ( in the arm and knee bends )
The Focea Comfort 4 was expanded at the Flex System 2 by more than doubling the area covered by the Flex System, in order to further increase the comfort.
The continuous stretch panels at the joints reduce friction ( shoulder, arm and knee bends).
High- quality preforms in the lower back area and in the thigh ensure a close-fitting, perfect fit.
The Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases the flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves the comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and fitting the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warm, waterproof material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
A continuous, thin (2 mm) seal around the face at the helmet increases the comfort, the seal and the durability ( separate helmet cap )
The soft, in the collar area zone improves the seal with a fine--tuneable width adjustment by a flexible and gentle Velcro closure which does not stick to the camouflage or the seams.
Double sleeves with a zipper at the elbow and ankle joints connect an inner sleeve that can be rolled up with a soft, laminated neoprene outer sleeve.
a 45° groove at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and durability when tightening.
A long zipper on the neck with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort without a helmet.
Langer G-Lock P back zipper ( overall without a helmet ) with a metal slider and an integrated water dam system for improved waterproofing ( Beuchat patent )
Zippers on the arms and legs
neoprene reinforcements on all ends of the zipper to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels glued together with overlapping outer and inner edges.
The edges of the outer sleeves are gusseted to increase their load--bearing capacity.
The edges of the inner sleeves are scored to increase flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer in place, especially for deeper dives ( the system is compatible with all common armband computers )
A career in social work - as someone with a self--destructive personality disorder.
He has an education in the field of software development and has been out of work for about a year.
However, he feels that this profession is not the right one for him, which is why he has been thinking for a long time about starting over and studying social work.
The problem is that he has an anxiety--avoidant personality disorder (AAVPD).
This means that he has a low self--esteem and is therefore shy.
He does not have a problem talking to people on a professional level, but it is very difficult for him to engage in casual conversations, and he has been told several times that he comes across as unapproachable ( which he believes has improved somewhat ).
I can become a social worker.
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in, for example, the addiction counselling or the family aid.
However, he does not know whether the actual workday is as he imagines it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS already causes problems in his job (for him, emotionally) because it makes him feel down every time there is something wrong with his code ( "again, the simplest things are screwed up " ) and it is hard for him to ask more experienced colleagues for help ( " he should already know how to do this by now " " he is holding him back with his dumb questions " " he must think he is underpaid " etc. ).
The problems are likely to be present in every profession, but it is worth mentioning them at this point.
But the sofa has already been returned to them.
Since there was no confirmation for this,.
He is waiting for a pick-up date.
What they mean by give back.
If a book has been downloaded from the #PRS Org #, the message is that the # PRS Org # authorized this book.
There are problems there.
I was in a chat with #PRS Org, who asked him if he had received a delivery confirmation for his wardrobe.
The protein taken in with the food is broken down in the bird's gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks ( amino acids ) and then the bird uses these to build its own body proteins, which it also needs for the formation of its feathers.
The plumage development of the nestling and the plumage renewal of the maturing bird are extremely complex processes and for the overall organism of the animal are associated with a particularly high burden.
It should be noted that Nekton Bio should not be fed during the breeding season, as this can lead to disruptions in the breeding cycle.
After this short period of giving Nekton B, the daily vitamin supply with Nekton S ( multivitamin preparation ) and Nekton MSA ( mineral substance preparation ) should have been resumed.

1 g of Nekton Bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is only necessary to prepare as much drinking water and soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water and food daily.
One scraped measuring spoon (included) equals one gram of Nekton Bio.
In the case of strong feather damage, the double or triple dose of Nekton Bio can be given at the beginning, until the appearance of the new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until the feather regrowth is complete.
Storage - Nekton Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as a desk chair.
How a desk chair can break down after 9 months.
In Germany, the warranty period is 24 months.
This is really very poor service.
Hello, he sent an e--mail on Monday to say that his order had arrived damaged and pictures had been attached.
They have received this email.
A statement by a member of the congregation in contradiction to the constitution.
Hello r / Legal Advice German.
He has the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on their property.
A complaint was also filed against the municipality..
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including the walnut tree, is not part of the statutes.
However, in the statutes, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a tree to be protected.
He can now rely on the employee's statement or not.
On the other hand, he has to rely on the opinion of an expert.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
I thanked them for their replies.
We understand this.
Then they will use the new packaging for that..
I have not received a message.
Then I still have a sofa without use.
They might be able to offer me a legacy or a voucher.
What were the more expensive ones.
Yes, that's what I think, but the question is whether he can deliver the blanket to Germany after paying in euros.
They can check it.
Eilmelding: severe traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious road traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the motorway junction Selb-Northeast and Plößberg.
According to the police's press alarm (14:03), a Pkw was overtaken in the opposite direction while overtaking.
There are injured.
Okay, I understand..
Well, then, many thanks for the fact that it went so smoothly.
Advice and ideas for a further career.
First of all, Merry Christmas to them.
My Christmas is unfortunately not very good, because his beloved head is currently destroying everything that can be destroyed.
Before I start rambling on and on ... in short: I need advice and, ideally, from people who know what it's like to be in his situation - i.e. from them.
He is currently doing the Ref course as a quereinsteiger..
Originally, he studied something else and worked in a related field (in order to remain somewhat anonymous, he does not name anything more specifically).
The whole thing was then too boring for him, and he started looking for alternatives that would be more fun for him.
At some point, he landed in the teaching profession and was sure that this is what he wanted to do, even though the framework conditions are much more rigid than in his previous job, but that was not important to him.
I am now at the third "I Google other job advertisements" stage..
and it has only been half a year.
In the paintings before that, I always decided to continue and at least finish the Ref, after which he can still change direction.
But right now, I'm absolutely exhausted..
In the last month, he had so little free time that he was completely exhausted.
The holidays are now, but there is still a lot of work waiting for him..
Before the Ref, I always thought that he was stress resistant, but that was his weekend and his party was his party.
There, I was free..
And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now, even the family celebration is too much stress for him.
And then there are these rigid structures that irritate me even more.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside looking in, the Ref runs well, in terms of feedback and so on.
But he is completely exhausted and asks himself how much stress his body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already done so.
I wonder if he wants to have this for the rest of his working life - especially when he reads some of the contributions from them -, or if he should not go back to the old area where he was valued, where he had free time when he needed it, where the work was somehow boring, but he was paid fairly for it, and where he worked together with a team and not as a lone fighter, as it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if, in a year's time, he hasn't come back to the same place he is in now, and is still unhappy.
They notice that it is all somehow confused, but perhaps they as outsiders have advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, in which she is completely exhausted and starts to cry at the slightest thought of it.
At the moment, decisions are not being made in an emotional way, this is likely to lead to nothing good.
But perhaps their views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for the time being.
Thanks for reading and apologizes for the whining tone.
I hope that his situation is at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of Vox amplifiers has steadily evolved, leading to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X / VT40X / VT100X amps, a brand new modeling engine is presented, which in terms of sound is absolutely state of the art.
Thanks to the VET technology ( Virtual Element Technology ), which is based on the analysis of the parts and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Even these amps contain, of course, the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these are able to reproduce the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed case and a bass- reflex system, from which the natural resonances only bubble up.
With the " Tone Room " software from Vox, they can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, until the amp and the effects sound the way they have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced Vox Valve Reactor technology.
Since then, it has been repeatedly refined to meet the new sound requirements of the VOx Valvetronix series, which led to a performance boost in 2010, with more dynamics and numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed in such a way that all guitarists on the hunt for a maximum of sound variety would find what they were looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in--depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the amplifier's preamplifier section had the character of a tube amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The 12AX7 tube- loaded Valve Reactor circuit of every VT+ amplifier perfectly reproduces the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA - Despite 20 points from Wagner, the Magic lost to the Clippers.
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues..
The Wagner brothers can shine - but the victory against the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro closure parts, it can be adapted to the needs of the photographer's equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras, from spiegellose system cameras of all sizes to full--format spiegelreflex cameras.
Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a detachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for additional lenses.
In addition, one can still stow a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera ( MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series ) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non- photographic things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also a good choice for drone pilots, as the rucksack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro with remote control and equipment.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma - the longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
An end is in sight.
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered to be the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past few days, but volcanologists dared not predict when it would end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable, said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state television channel RTVE.
Damages in millions of euros
In the three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000 degrees Celsius hot lava has destroyed more than 2900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
About 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter- thick lava layer.
This is almost 1700 football fields..
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Before the coast, two new land masses were formed by the cooling of lava, with an area of about 50 hectares.
The banana industry, which directly or indirectly employs about half of the island's 85,000 inhabitants and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was particularly badly affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and other areas were heavily damaged, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension have a seductive effect.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still unites the increasingly divided society.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace--bringing "societal contract of primitive peoples" becomes alive again in the context of this tradition.
From Nikolaus to the Christkind
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who connected the Christmas days with gift--giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in one form or another.
The background of this still today popular custom is that the Saint Nicholas, bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women in one night in order to save them from a life of sin.
This unconventional form of giving gave rise to the popular German custom of filling the children's boots with gifts.
Protestants objected to this custom because they reject the idea of saints as mediators between God and man.
For these reasons, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas into the Christ Child, thereby laying the foundation for a new traditions line.
The focus of the giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since the majority of Protestants no longer see these details as so important, it only annoys the fewest that the tradition of St. Nicholas, similar to the Martin's tradition with Martin's singing and Martin's parade, is still a firm part of the pre--Christmas period.
Today, one finds boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to luxury watches, everything that the heart desires.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of the Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, however, there is a festive muddle over the question of who will now bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it varies from region to region as to whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who in essence is a kind of St. Nicholas, acquires certain characteristics over time.
Theses include, for example, his white Rauschebart, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure of the Christmas celebration.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who has shown them the way to the Jesus child.
In Scandinavia, at times, mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought fame.
Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars,, the Christkind is responsible for delivering the gifts.

The police shot a suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace.
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that the caller had reported a man with a weapon who had gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
The man fled in a vehicle, according to the authorities,, which was later stopped by police.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
In the area around the Kensington Palace there are several embassies.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The robust plastic version is suitable for use in the outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually dangerous objects from distant galaxies that internally glow brightly.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone is responsible for the fact that this solar lighthouse fascinatingly shines - in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The edge-less, amorphous design is deliberately chosen - like a large natural--shaped pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic roundings fit in any natural environment – whether on the terrace edge, in the lawn or in a stone bed.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he is able to hold his own due to his size.
Greater preparatory work can be spared: as a solar lamp, "Smart Stone" does not require a power supply or batteries.
The "Leuchtstein" can be placed on a believable, sun--bathed place.
Two earth pegs are provided, which can be used if necessary.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar panel conceals "Smart Stone" discreetly within its interior, along with his battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight hits the housing.
At dusk, Smart Stone begins to glow of its own accord, with six attractive light colors to choose from, in addition to daylight white - red, yellow, green, blue, and purple.
The shutdown also occurs automatically when the battery's charge level falls to a predetermined minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins again the next day from the beginning.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope that he does everything right here, after a year of reddit, it is his first post..
To his problem, he started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because he had such unbearable pain during his period and terrible PMS before the period.
Now, I would like to stay with this decision, because he suffers from chronic illnesses and has to take a lot of medication that he cannot choose.
His main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but his skin.
During his last approximately two--year break from 0 to 100, he had explosive pimples all over his body.
So far, so superficial, but it made me feel very uncomfortable and I didn't feel well.
In the two years of pause, the situation has never really normalized.
Maybe someone somewhere has some tips to avoid this happening again.
Perfume- free and without any nonsense, my cosmetics are already, but perhaps there is something that someone could recommend.
The female doctor didn't take him seriously and the dermatologist's appointment is still to come..
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel through.
After all, the skin is such a thing.
Hade severe neurodermatitis before, then a period of rest, then large patches of pustular psoriasis and the acne issue.
He also tried various diets in the context of his Christian illness, and ended up on a sugar, milk and meat- free mixed diet, because nothing else worked so well.
It may also be the case that Hormonell is simply the problem, but if you, like me, has a lot of work to do everywhere, he would rather not go looking for something else that is going wrong..
He had already had all of his colleague's semen.
Wrote and now lost the conversation and does not know what the response was to his complaint.
In between, I have to work at the telephone and suddenly everything was gone.
If the money was there, I would have seen it.
Check my bank details, perhaps there was something wrong there.
but he is generally available in large numbers.
since he is available in black in large numbers.

A 110 kV earth cable will be rebuilt in 2022.
The approval for the relocation of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision makes the way clear for the construction to begin in 2022.
The Netzbetreiber Bayernwerk announced this now..
The 7 km long earth cable will connect the Umspannwerk Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is near the village of Edermanning near Reut connected to a mast of the overhead line.
Good morning.
My order from 03.01.2021 with the order number # Number # has not yet arrived in its entirety.
The blue Betsell number # PRS Org # with the number # Number # was sent back by # PRS Org # with the note " Delivery not possible ".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitively possible.
He can tell me nothing about the further course of events.
A nice start to the week.
They can forget this, he had already explained it to them several times yesterday.
This is a commode made of glass, and all the sides are broken, so there is glass everywhere, and the box is broken.
The commode stands in his apartment and #PRS-Org# refuses to enter the apartment because of the #PRS- Org # regulations.
This means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter the apartment.
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR.
The original value of this chair was #Number # euros.
No, it is the case with all books, that is why the request was made to # PRS Org #, as it is a general problem.
Planning lessons (EK)
Hello, dear colleagues,
Since the summer, he has been in the Ref, he enjoys teaching, but he currently has major problems planning his geography lessons in an efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so he can only use the blackboard, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can also only copy in black and white for free ( which is annoying for geography ).
At the moment, he needs a lot of time to plan his hours.
For example, they are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors, and at the moment, each hour stands on its own.
In principle, the methods used are always the same, but on the other hand, he does not want to spend too much time on simple lessons (which he also needs for UBs and so on).
When planning, he usually starts from the learning goal (what he wants to achieve) and then thinks about how he can build it up ( he usually creates an exercise sheet with texts from books that his school does not have ).
He has the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book he is not satisfied.
There are also the worksheets.
Perhaps a geography teacher could tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really like that..
I would like to return the # PRS Org # from the order # Number #.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS Org #, but he would like the return to be handled as quickly as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G rule for the Christmas business.
In most businesses, only those who have been vaccinated or cured are allowed to enter..
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of sales losses.
He also has a possible solution.
According to the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G regulations damage the important Christmas business of the retail trade.
The HDE's chief executive, Stefan Genth, criticized the fact that sales of non- everyday goods were affected by a drop in turnover.
According to a recent survey of the HDE among 1,100 traders, more than 70 percent of the companies were pessimistic about the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without a bottom, said Genth.
In the previous week, traders with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre--crisis turnover.
Only in the foodstuffs retail sector and in the online sector, things were going well..
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
" 2G at the grocery store does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic, he said.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a high level of staffing.
He demanded that the belt rule be allowed nationwide.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all businesses with the band they received that day.
In addition, in the retail trade – as already in public transport with the 3G rule ( vaccinated, recovered or tested ) – sample checks would be sufficient.
Even the specialist in shopping centers, the real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre--corona levels, while the turnover was at about 90 percent.
These numbers are now falling in the middle of the so important Christmas business, said board chairman Wilhelm Wellner to the " Wirtschaftswoche ".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions were sought and permits were obtained for the centers.
This also includes the so-called band solution, where " the visitors, for example, once present their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then, equipped with an armband similar to those in a club hotel, are allowed to freely enter all the shops. dpa
He has recently ordered and received the #PRS Organ #.
The Spiegel has a scratch and the frame also has a flaw, which was attempted to be covered up with yellow filler.
It looks unpleasant.
I would like to return the mirror and has already put it back in the package and sealed it.
Now he must decide how to proceed with the return.
The lamp is designed for Dual Balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp is controlled by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities..
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to set the color temperature in the range of 3100 – 5650K manually and to save it.
They use the current settings in the flash memory..
One of the special features of the controllers is that they are simple and intuitive to use.
The Leuchte produces a very high light output with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, which allows them to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is excellent.
E.g. also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to use both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the light to be remotely controlled in television studios or when the light is mounted in an inaccessible place.
On the back of the Leuchte is the control panel, which consists of switches and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to adjust the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, they are simply held down for a longer period of time by pressing one of the memory tastes.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the known situation is re-established - very practical in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to a particular colour temperature.
Working with batteries is one of the DL3120's greatest strengths. its functionality is derived from the ability to run on inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so they can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it has a battery tester built in, for each of the two battery compartments a value is displayed on the two display screens ( the left battery compartment on the upper display screen, the right on the lower display screen).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the spotlight with electricity through the supplied power supply.
The construction of the searchlight is very simple.
It has a 16mm socket for attachment, allowing it to be attached directly to a photographer's tripod.
The inclination is reliably adjusted by means of fixings on both sides.
Greater emphasis was placed on ensuring that the mechanical components were of the highest quality and were designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a Neigegelenk is included in the delivery.
Grossartig, the package also includes a bag.
This allows them to transport or store the light with all the additional equipment they may wish to purchase..
It's a shame, I received it as a gift and it is too small.
"The party they wanted to throw ": Frankfurt celebrates after a torrid comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in a row defeated Hessians appeared to be on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned it around, scored five goals within an hour to get the frustration over a lacklustre start to the season out of their system and won the game furiously with 5-2. "It's insane what the guys have done today," jubilated coach Oliver Glasner on DAZn and spoke a "pauschal praise to every individual who was involved in the game " out.
At first, it looked as if it would be another blow for the now ninth in the standings, still behind their expectations, Frankfurt side.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What then happened impressed even the SGE coach.
"The players then returned and showed a fantastic performance, as Glasner continued.
I am very happy with the performance the team showed and also with the result.
Also defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth matchday and overcame his muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think the mentality of the team is incredible," said the 27-year-old and was pleased with the result in particular for the spectators.
This was the party they wanted to throw today..
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but is also well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is exceptional that all players are fit in December, that all players are physically in a top condition.
It is top work in the medical department, but also the players live a highly professional lifestyle.
Now they want to "step by step move forward and remain humble" and complete the tasks until the end of the year " at this level.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday (18:30 BST, Sky) as part of the English week.
In the meantime, he received the mail that his package was sent back to him because of a mistake on his part.
He tried to call #PRS Org # and it was diverted to no avail.
It can be sent directly to him again or he has to wait until the money is reimbursed and the order is resubmitted.
For me, that would then mean that he would not order again because it had already taken a long time.
They have already sat on the #PRS Org # chairs.
Dampers for the women's handball team before the quarterfinals against Spain.
Germany's women's handball team slumped after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and blank stares.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB national team suffered a heavy defeat against Spain with a score of 16-32 (8-13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face the host country in the quarterfinals.
"They were much too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," coach Henk Groener said.
Against Spain, they must play differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8-2 points as second behind the Danes (10-0).
It is a pity that they did not take the flow with them.
Everyone played a bad game and they have to be deleted, said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi--finals on the following Tuesday, there must be a significant improvement in order to keep alive the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three--time Olympic champion Denmark was the backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We weren't there at all - neither in the attack, nor in the defense, Xenia Smits admitted, and demanded that "we have to look ahead now. "
From front to back, not on the same level
Unlike in the previous five tournament matches, the German team was not at its best at the start of the match.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and holes in the defense were responsible for the quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the job and prevented worse with several saves..
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 93 minutes, when Grijseels finished a quick counterattack successfully.
This, however, was not the hoped-for initial spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make a scene - and when they did, they often failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was already over at 3-10 after 20 minutes, as the backcourt player Mia Zschocke was disqualified for a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection started to get into the game, and by the end of the first half they were only five goals behind.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes when the score was 9-19.
The Greens again sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well--played opponent, who is one of the medal contenders at the end of the tournament.
As a result, the German team was not able to achieve a performance increase and left the court as the clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, the Nikolaustag has been won and is used as an opportunity to look at family traditions in the pre--Christmas period, the Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.
How it was back then at home with them.
As with their partner.
They want to pass on their traditions to their children as well.
What is the best thing for the children is
The shoe cleaning.
Plum cake baking.
decorating trees.
It is played.
The Christmas man, the Christ child or the gift is from Grandma and Grandpa.
No matter how they do it, they all try to make it as nice as possible as a family around Christmas..
Whether or not these are now established traditions, or even if they vary from year to year, they tell us how things are done in their family.
Send me, please, some sort of transaction number or something else that might help.
confirmation of an overseas transfer ...
I would like to give a voucher as a gift.
just as with #PRS Org # poison vouchers.
This is the case with them.
The title implies that he works as a mobile vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/ Pfizer vaccine is mainly used to vaccinate nursing homes.
As these are now almost finished, the next step is to go to vaccination centers for me.
I will gladly answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. "I takes medication X, it is compatible with the vaccination. ")
In his area of responsibility is the dissemination of information about the vaccination, the indication (the person has a right to be vaccinated according to the corona vaccination regulation and no reasons against it) the doctor's documentation and, if necessary, the emergency treatment of allergic reactions ( which has never happened to him ).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In the vaccination teams, they often do not have a doctor with them, but only pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of the vaccine, who are not allowed to carry out the vaccinations, so that he also carries out most of the vaccinations himself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question - Amberger knows the solution
What on earth a "Huidlerer" is.
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused a lot of thought in the BR television programme "WIR in Bavaria".
However, unlike on many previous days, the term remained unidentified by the callers on this occasion.
No, it was not a "nervous man".
and also no one "who has to move everything quickly. "
According to what the people heard from the TV presenter,, this is completely false.
Where the man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus probably also surprised many Oberpfalzers.
"The Huidlerer ", the audience learned, " is a rag that someone uses to wipe the oven. "
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, for years interviewed by the Bavarian Television as an expert, confirmed this.
with the note that it is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well--known dialect word " Houdern ".
With the closure of a gap in education - probably also for many who have been living in the area of Amberg for a long time.
He has been unable to buy books for two weeks.
After the confirmation comes the following error message: oops – something went wrong – try again later.
He has restarted the #PRS #Org # with the PC connected, synchronized and repaired the # PRS # Org #.
Nothing has helped.
Tyre choice for the racing bike - really safe.
This morning, he woke up full of energy because he wanted to at least a little bit train for his upcoming bicycle tour in the coming week.
Said and done, he took his racing bike, which he had bought the day before on eBay, and set off.
The first 40 km were also really beautiful - but then what happens in every inner city ( this time in Krefeld ) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, there was a loud hissing and my rear wheel didn't want to go any further.
As he did not have the opportunity to buy a replacement coat and a replacement hose on account of the day of the week, he was forced to turn back and take the first available train back home.
Then, in terms of wages, it was not so bad either, perhaps it is even better that he practiced changing the tire before the bicycle tour..
But now he stands before a question and hopes that they can help him.
Since he has a relatively long journey ahead of him over several days, he does not want to get this problem again.
At this point, the old tyres from the previous owner (a very nice old man who came to pick up the bicycle on the day he bought it at 14:00, having travelled 120 km with them, which he described as suboptimal because he had been riding them for years on a bicycle) and which he himself described as suboptimal because he had been riding them for years on a bicycle were still not bad.
But when I think about the fact that he still has to change a tire after driving for 80-90 km, he is really in a bad mood :D
Now he was talking to an older man at the platform who asked him why he was not using the Marathon Plus tires, which are said to be unplottable.
Now, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But these are not really so indestructible.
I don't feel like spending 40 euros per tyre now, only to then be disappointed.
In addition, he wonders: he currently has 25x622 tires on his racing bike.
There are also (apparently) at the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are already wider.
This is a problem.
or they would advise me to use other types of tyres on a racing bike in general.
The Schwalbe side seems to prefer the Durano DD.
Thanks in advance for the help and love.
The car crashed into a tree, the driver was fatally injured.
The 53-year-old was on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his vehicle for an unknown reason and crashed into a middle island and then onto the opposite side of the road, as the police reported.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year old.
The car of the 53-year old was then thrown against a tree and the man in the car was crushed.
The 27-year old driver and his 23 year old co--pilot were severely injured in the accident and were transported to nearby hospitals.

I will receive a confirmation by mail for this.
He has been told this three times by his colleagues, how reliable his information is.
When the shipping company will contact him.
I have already written that they have not received his sms.
After the publication of their new high--end breitbands B 100 - 6 Ohms, it was only a matter of time before the Solo series also received new members.
Solo 15 is the name of the new offspring and it resembles optically the big predecessors with the B 200 - 6 Ohms.
However, in this construction proposal, a correspondingly designed foot is included as part of the design, to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
Principally, the Solo 15 is very well suited for people who do not care much about the maximum sound level, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound quality.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is not capable of generating near- unfiltered such large sound pressure levels.
However, this does not mean that the Solo 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is an impressive adult and for its size it is extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonal was the Solo 15 tuned with a slight high tone rise.
This is common practice among broadbanders to optimize the increasingly strong bundling of the high frequencies.
The SOlo 15 has a very clear and fine sound, which is exactly aimed at the listening place.
A slight turn to the outside can reduce the high tone range and so make the sound picture warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the location of the individual components of a musical piece is pinpointed in the optimal stereo triangle with amazing precision.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 Ohms make for a foe that is hard to find.
The Solo 15 complements not only the Solo Series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of their construction kits, at the beginning of the construction, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the loudspeaker, in order to be able to make corresponding changes during the construction.
If, for example, the housing is to be furnished,, the lowering of the speakers must be adjusted accordingly, since the furnishing adds material.
After all the plates were cut to size (e.g. in a hardware store), the first 8 mm hole should be drilled in the floor plate at the corresponding location to allow the cable to be easily passed through later.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the speaker opening is now made in the front, so that the B 100 – 6 Ohms can later be fitted bang on.
The backside of the opening should be equipped with a 45° bevel to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis in the interior as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture " Detail of the phase " shown.
After that, the actual construction of the box begins and one of the two side walls is placed on a flat surface in front of him.
Theses are now glued onto the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor.
The three reinforcements should also be inserted and glued in.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in thickness as needed, if, for example, one chooses to use prefabricated beams from the hardware store rather than making them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next work step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
With the help of a suitable circular saw or a forestry drill, the holes for the bass reflex tubes, as well as the attachment of the connection clamp on the back wall are made easier.
After that, a circular grinder is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The upper surface of the footplate can also be rounded.
After that, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the case and additionally fastened with long wooden screws.
The marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the connection clamp follows.
After the housing of wood dust was cleaned ( sucked or blown ), the laying of the cable begins.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm Bassreflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncut cable piece is pushed through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, where it is left sticking out for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening, where it hangs loose.
The following is the preparation and deployment of the frequency switch.
The construction plan of the frequency changer, as well as the corresponding attachment plan can be taken from the following document: Montageanleitung Weiche Solo 15.
Once the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
The 35 mm bassreflex opening can be closed with some skill by spraying hot glue onto it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the seal can be checked.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and fastened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive cable (marked cable) must be attached to the positive pole of the speaker ( the larger contact ) .
At the end, the bassreflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm ( total length of the tube ) and inserted.
The damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex tube should be kept open.
I can also make an order now, and have it delivered in early June.
Hello to all.
At last, they can announce that they will also hold the OSCAcast again this year.
Due to known reasons, it is not possible for Uns to have more than four people in the studio at a time, which means that there is a higher planning burden and the short notice of the announcement explains this.
But there will be at least three people on the panel, so the Oscars 2021 will be broadcast with at least seven people on the stream and hopefully thousands of viewers.
They do their best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic, and we will do everything possible to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
Around 0:30, it will start.
Prepares cold drinks, plans a good meal and is ready for a long, but very interesting night.
