The annual art festival of the University of Wenzhou features a performance by the university's top student, who presents the university's research achievements to the public.
Use air to wash hands, mouth air that judges the disease, scintillating dust that comes from the source of the previous day's dawn, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year at Waseda University. a series of scientific achievements were honored.
These achievements are mainly from researchers who are students, research topics include the environment, machinery, energy sources, biomedicine, life sciences and human culture and education. Researchers from a wide range of fields began with a common point of origin and have created a number of high--tech inventions that have been awarded in both the United States and internationally.
biological sensing device, the body's medical physician.
Biological medical science engineering college graduate doctor Zhang Fuding's team performed a live demonstration of an intelligent biological sensing device that was only half the size of a computer.
" He only needs to blow a small amount of air into the device, it can then detect the composition of his body's air. "
The set of sensors and the intelligent computer are connected and the gaseous substance is released after which the health report is shown on the computer.
The city market is able to detect the health condition of the intelligent hand ring by measuring the temperature and pulses, other physical parameters.
On the other hand, this set of biological sensors uses a new type of material, graphene, which is a new type of material. its target is a chemical element and it is sensitive to detect the state of the body's health.
Intelligent surgical lamp, medical high energy eye.
Apart from the intelligent computer, the surgery room also uses the intelligent surgical lamp.
This project was invented in the 44th year of the 44th International Swiss Inventions Exhibition and won a silver award..
The light and electrical science and engineering graduate student, Jian Liang Tian and his team started a new path in traditional handicrafts and invented a smart LED handicrafts with no shadow.
"There are many diseases with early symptoms that are not detected in the early stages of the examination. they are not detected in the medical laboratory. "
In the early stages of the disease, when examining the tissue, the doctor cannot see all of the pigmented cells, thus the disease continues to spread.
This type of intelligent artificial intelligence has four spheres of light, by adjusting the light spectrum, to increase the intensity of different organisms in the light spectrum.
During surgery, the surgeon can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and opacity of the light beam, in accordance with the needs of the surgical process and the habit of the person.

In the previous year, October, this project was awarded the first prize in the national competition.
use air-conditioned hand : it saves water as well as cooling.
The common man's method of washing his hands is to use water to wash his hands, while the topmost layer of his skin is rubbed with a small amount of soap, and a small amount of water is used to wash his hands. The Li Bingchuan and his colleagues invented a set of " air-borne hand washing equipment " .
Only by standing on the platform of the air pressure compressor, the weight of their bodies would cause the air pressure to be compressed and released.
"It's like an air duct.
Pressure is reduced and air is compressed in the water dragon's mouth, this forms a flow of water and the water is joined together.
This way, they can wash their hands cleanly..
The colour reaction and fungal spore survival test prove that the method of washing hands is the same as that of the common method of washing hands.
This device only needs to rely on the gravitational force of its own body to propel itself, at the same time, it is able to achieve a 90% reduction in water consumption and is completely free of energy consumption..
In the previous year, at the second world summit of mountain climbers, this project emerged from the top universities in the world. and won the only gold medal.

Good, annoying.
A document of great importance, a passport.
This is the only thing besides the pilot's licence that is of importance to him.
In general, emergency relief is actually a response to an emergency situation, is carried out by the arrival of a rescue helicopter before the arrival of a rescue helicopter, is carried out by a rescue helicopter.
The vast majority of people are aware of the fact that the accident occurred after the rescue helicopter arrived, that the rescue helicopter arrived after a period of time and that this period of time is the most crucial..
This is the time when the need for emergency aid is most urgent..
If he really has heart pneumonia, pneumonia of the throat, lung collapse, lung collapse, he only has four minutes to live, he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he only has four minutes to live. he
Therefore, people close to him need to be rescued as quickly as possible.
When there are people around at the same time, they can use their special knowledge to help each other to rescue the situation,, but they are not able to do anything because they do not move and do nothing. This kind of helplessness makes people feel sad..
In China, the official death toll is three million people per year, the most dangerous of which is heart stroke.
In the United States, 15 percent of the population is able to survive.
At the Las Vegas boxing arena, 78% of the audience were able to survive. in Shanghai and Beijing, less than 1% of the audience survived. "
This is the first reaction from the creator of the game, Landl Leck..
If one person suffers a heart stroke breakdown, breathing stops, the heart stops and there is no use of the person in the middle.
In order to be rescued, it is necessary for a human being to be rescued by artificial breathing, chest- compression, CPR.
He discovered that the number of people with this kind of awareness had decreased over time, but that it was still a problem at the time of the incident. Therefore, he urged all people to learn this kind of emergency response technique.
It is still possible to save one person' s life.
An emergency passport can be obtained at the Red Cross's training centre in Beijing, and also at the Red Cross 's training centre in Shanghai. Students also have the benefit of being given preferential treatment.
At the end, the last picture is a record of his 25th birthday goal, to put the emergency passport in the list of his goals, which was also completed a few months earlier.
Thereafter, he intends to obtain other certificates, plans to obtain a submerged water rescue certificate. before in the small red book, he saw that there were still other submerged water rescue certificates and that it was necessary to obtain a submerged water rescue certificate in order to be able to obtain a submerged water rescue certificate. Therefore, the submerged water rescue certificate is also very useful.
He ordered  three numbers.

The previous day, the PRS Organization sent food to him, this time he was given a single crayfish to eat.
Because of the fact that he had previously entered the code, he saw that it was effective.
First,, he said that the film is a " bad film " from all sides.
However, he also said that this part of the film was not a highlight and that the music was not as good as the rest of the film.
There are many varieties of this film, making it possible to watch it in a cinema. One of these is the film " Four Seas " which is based on the story of a monkey.

In the eyes of the viewers, this point, the Thai boxer is a true talent.
This part of the film is the one that makes the most people feel the pain of suffering. is because it resembles a fictional creature from a short story, is difficult to name and has many holes and holes like the skin of the fictional creature from a short story.
To the extent that he watches it afterward, he may have the impression that the director is hiding a hidden message,, but when he examines it closely afterwards, he discovers that it is in fact a film depicting a fire.
First,, the story is very difficult to understand.
The male main inhabitant's dwelling place is likely to be located in the southern part of a small island, and he is accompanied by his elderly mother.
She had a desire to see the snow in the East, and then the drama unfolded and she went to the East to see the snow.
An elderly man sits on a face masked car from the south to the east to see the snow.
He and his father were not overly concerned about it.
Then, this old man stopped writing..
In a cargo ship, a woman takes over the management of the business..
The island's mountain road can be made into a road to the town.
After the road was cleared, a steel reinforcement cage was placed in the middle of the road, the four surrounding roads were blocked by the cage. All of the traffic control vehicles were unable to reach the site.
This feeling of the road also became more apparent.
One of the most significant and controversial aspects of the 2008 Olympic Games was the presence of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, the Beijing 2
Faces against high- profit for not reporting to the police, the film's police inspector also asked whether there was a dangerous situation.
A 40- year old man understands how to use a smart computer,, but he does not know how to use a room card to open the door and to sit in a room and sleep..
This kind of bizarre plot twists throughout the entire film, due to the overwhelming intensity of the emotional scenes,, which makes it difficult to remember it.
The only exception to this is the plot of the film, or that the film has no main purpose, which is the story of a monster with a hole in its face.
The film begins with him saying he wanted to make a comedy film, 20 minutes later, he thinks it is a dramatic film and after watching half of the film, he thinks it could be a drama. After watching the film, he has no idea what it is about and he has doubts about his own judgement.
For most people, it's actually common knowledge that there are a wide variety of film genres, that include action films, comedies, dramas and so on. For example, a young man who aspires to be a movie star has a dream of becoming a boxer.
If he wants to make a love film, he will talk about the love between a young man from a small town and a service worker girl.
If he wants to reflect the present reality, the most basic thing is that his emotional sequence is not able to emerge and conform to the norms of the Western world.
( For example, the actor who played the character was burned, then was able to sing the song of the role, even though he was unable to see through the eyes of the character. ) , but he was unable to see through the eyes of the character.
As far as the female main character, she is not a weak character, in some ways she behaves like a 5-year old child. I does not know what this is due to her acting skills but also because of the demands of the director.
There is also one point that he is not quite clear about, which is that he is so passionate about the racing scenes in his own film that he has added a crash sequence.
This type of film is scheduled to be released during the spring season, it is difficult for audiences to accept it.

South African physician Clive Gandey said that although the spread of the disease was widespread, it was mostly mild.
South African medical and medical research experts believe that the new strain of the disease caused by the new variant of the disease is less severe than the strain of the disease caused by the new variant of the disease, although the speed of transmission is faster.
According to a report by the Associated Press,, as the disease spreads in South Africa, the 5,000- member medical staff team formed a medical officer group to report that the symptoms of the new disease were mostly mild, similar to the symptoms of fever and flu- like illnesses.

The average length of stay in the hospital decreased from 8 days to 28 days. The proportion of deaths was only 3 percent, while the proportion of deaths in the first wave of the epidemic increased from 20 percent to 28 percent.

He also said, "  now it is still early, they need to obtain later data.
Normally, hospitalization and deaths occur later,, but in this one-- wave of infection, they only occur for two weeks..
At the same time, worldwide, scientists are observing the number of cases and the number of hospitalized patients, while also testing the effectiveness of the disease's current vaccine and treatment methods.
However, despite being the world's most common new coronavirus strain, the disease is now widespread in more than 100 countries, South Africa is the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases increased by 400 percent, tests revealed that 90 percent of the new cases were of the viral strain.

Nearly a month ago, the Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Bureau launched the development of a child missing information emergency broadcasting platform.
This is to establish a child lost and found information broadcasting authority and to find the missing child by creating a global information platform.
Hearing the name of the band as " a group of friends " , the audience perceived a warm feeling.
The new technology technique is not only called " literature " , but also affectionate and effective use of information.
The first priority of the police is to find the kidnapped child and to protect his person's safety and freedom.
Secondly,, there is a criminal court and a punishment court.
The meaning of criminal punishment, varies from individual punishment to social prevention to law education. It can list many " big words " .
However, in the case of the Mugging incident, the first priority was the safety of the victim.
Subjects such as the fate of the kidnapped child, the behavior of the kidnappers, the circumstances of the kidnapping, the fate of the kidnapped child, the behavior of the kidnappers, the circumstances of the kidnapping, the fate of the kidnapped child, the behavior of the kidnappers, the circumstances of the kidnapping, the fate of the kidnapped child, the behavior of the kidnappers, the circumstances of the kidnapping, the fate of the kidnapped child, the behavior of the kidnappers, the circumstances of the kidnapping, the fate of the kidnapped child, the behavior of the kidnappers, the circumstances of the kidnapping, the fate of the kidnapped child, the behavior of the kidnappers, the circumstances of the kidnapping, the fate of the kidnapped child, the behavior of the kidnappers, the circumstances of the kidnapping, the fate of the kidnapped child, the behavior of the kidnappers, the circumstances of the kidnapping, the fate of the kidnapped child, the behavior of the kidnapp

In this situation, they can be used as a " round table " platform, which has a direct impact on the investigation of missing children and the effective implementation of the work.
In the end,, "  playing with a dodge " is a need for the entire law enforcement system to work well.
Deter crime, protect child and women's rights, from the law to the judiciary, with no exceptions.
In addition, child protection from the home to the society can also be improved.
For example, one common case is a family of three living in a fire station who went to sleep and woke up to find their child missing.
It is not possible to expect a two- year old child to have sufficient self- protection techniques, but as a parent, he must have a similar level of protection awareness.
Fathers and mothers, the two people, wheel flow rest, also or place the child in a safe place under the protection of the guard. both are the most basic method to prevent the kid from being kidnapped.

It can be seen that part of the people have a view of raising children in the form of women, that is weakened by the law.
This part of the population's law- enforcement and education should proceed at the same pace.
To have effective control over criminal offenders, it is not possible to rely solely on the strict enforcement of the law by the authorities.
It is possible that the market is widespread and the seller's desire to make money is endless, that the seller is constantly inventing new ways of selling and that the law enforcement officers are confronted with a situation in which the effectiveness of the law enforcement is decreasing.
Therefore, it has also assisted in the proliferation of child abuse and child prostitution.

The American Asian- American group filed a lawsuit against the University of Georgia, the University of Florida and the University of South Carolina..
The new China Daily Washington 5th month 23rd day report ( reporter Eithus Currine ) of the United States 1300th Asian- American group of organizations on the 23rd of the 5th month submitted a complaint to the United States Department of Education and the United States Department of Justice against the admission process of the University of Virginia, the University of North Carolina, and the University of Texas.
The head of the Asian American Education Association held a press conference in Washington, D.C. to announce the launch of the Asian American Education Association.
In the past 10 years, the number of Asian students seeking admission to American colleges and universities has increased dramatically,, but in these three universities, the proportion of Asian students has remained relatively stable.
Many studies have shown that these high schools in their admission process have a long--lasting and systematic discrimination against Asian- Americans.
In 2014, researchers at the University of Michigan, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Illinois found that Asian- Americans had the lowest acceptance rate among all ethnic groups in all three universities.
The U.S. Department of Education's statistics also show that in all of the common spring freshman colleges, the University of Maryland and the University of Virginia had the lowest percentage of Asian- American students. The University of South Carolina and the University of Virginia had the highest percentage of Asian American students.
Wao Ura announced to the reporter of the People' s Daily that they planned to submit a complaint after the US Education Department and the Justice Department were able to launch an investigation and determine the facts. They also planned to stop the high school from recruiting Asian- Americans.
They also hoped that the high school would be able to actively address the issue and change its admission policy towards Asian- Americans.
Currently, three universities have not responded to the accusations.
The Asian American Education Association was founded in 2015, filed a lawsuit against the University of Hawaii at the time, but the U.S. Department of Education ruled that the university's admission process was not discriminatory.
This time, the lawsuit was joined by American Chinese groups outside the United States, also including American Indian, Japanese and Pakistani groups.

However, although the right wing has had a period of glory in history, it has not been long, so it is due to its short period of glory that it has been weakened. It is because of this weakness that the right wing has been vulnerable to attacks and has been defeated.
However, in reality, the right-wing has played a significant role in the progress of society.

In terms of his views, although he does not agree with all of Lee's views, he still respects him because he is serious about China and his views on China's social problems are serious.
However, he is opposed to his communist ideology, he believes that a revolution is necessary to destroy society, the people are suffering and the political bodies are disorganized and chaotic.
Fourth,, China must have endurance and a nationalist attitude, a political mandate from the masses, and an attitude that is not right-wing.
Repeatedly talk about the left side.
In fact, it is a period of time and a political downfall.
In the case of the right, the Communist Party has to accept some of the right's speech and analysis of their thoughts,, because the Communist Party needs to do so at certain times. As a result, the Communist Party's propaganda has become leftist.
Five years ago, he saw some of his friends in the back of a truck, being dragged away by the police. He felt that they were being treated unfairly and that they were being mistreated.
Following the arrest of a Chinese diplomat, left- wing activist, there is no reason to talk about politics.

Many people in their youth also have idealism,, but later on, they forget their idealism or pursue their idealism,, but they become dogmatic.
and ideal progress is slow and distant,, and the dreams of a young boy end in becoming a bad dragon.
In general, one's perception of left and right is a reference to freedom and liberty, but China's history and culture are based on the idea of a center, which means that China as a whole is inclined to the left.
In contrast, the domestic right-- wing faction emphasized efficiency and development, the left wing faction emphasized surveillance and security.
In the current society, there is a general desire for a more egalitarian society, at the same time, the conflict between China and the United States is perceived as a left-ist issue and is expected to persist for a long time.
Although it is difficult to understand, they praise it as a great achievement.

The United States is putting pressure on China's computer chip industry, requires its own and allied countries' computer chip industry to be shut down at the same time. The result of this is that the computer chip production industry of the United States suffered a decline in research and development investment and a decline in production capacity. as a result of this, the computer chip production industry of the United States suffered a decline in production capacity.
In the meantime, " the shortage of chips " has spread to all the major industries,, for example, the production of cars, the increase in the price of computers and almost all the industries affected by the shortage of chips.
In order to control " chip technology " independently, more and more countries of science and technology began to follow the " anti- Americanization " path.

The reason for the tension between China and the United Kingdom is due to the 30- year old dispute between Taiwan and the United Kingdom over the ownership of a mineral deposit.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States was the world's leading manufacturer of aircraft.
By the end of the 1980s, the world's top half of the world's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half of the world 's top half
In the early days of the video game industry, most video games were made by a single company, with the design, manufacture of the game being done by the same company. This was the case with the first video game, Pong, which was made by Atari.
On the other hand, this way of production means that some small businesses are not able to bear the huge construction costs. and many young entrepreneurs are unable to move forward.
In the 1980s, as demand for computer chips increased, the chip manufacturing industry began to emerge. In 1984, Zhang Zhucui, who heard that a company specializing in chip design had been established, realized that it was possible to establish a factory specializing in the manufacture of chips.
Not long after,, Zhang's plot was transformed into reality, Taiwan's industrial revolution began.
The Tianjin Ingenious Electronics Corporation is the main business of Tianjin Ingenious Electronics Corporation, which specializes in the manufacture of crystalline glass. It does not produce designs, only provides crystalline glass manufacturing as a substitute.
At that time, the company was just created by Tescom, it was a small company in the face of the giant Tescom.
For the sake of gaining support, Zhang's chief advisor had previously sought investment from English Titan,, but at the time, English Titan's assessment of Taiwan's electronics industry was that it was only capable of manufacturing computer chips. This assessment was perceived to be inadequate, and English Titan subsequently refused to invest in Taiwan.
In addition,, T. C. S. also recognized that English Tetriel at that time was not interested in the crystal manufacturing process.
I didn't expect that in the year of 2000, they had not been interested in the manufacture of crystal glass, but now they also have to start manufacturing crystal glass replacements.
thus,,Zhang Chuang Tian thought that the English were attempting to infiltrate the Ming Dynasty.
In the meantime, the value of the Tai SInchong Electric City has exceeded that of England.
In the face of the aggressive offensive of the Taiwanese company, the English company was not able to maintain a steady pace.

Good, the telephone number.
He needs to stay in the other person's dialogue.
I told his staff on the telephone that he was going to do it.
They told him that the distance was too far.

The location is in the south of the Inner City of Beijing, on the 156th number of the Inner City of Beijing and in the 12th floor of the Lucky House Fountain.
One of his friends introduced him because of his friendship and so he chose to start the renovation with a budget of 7 million yuan.
When he arrived at the shop, he started a series of tricks.
He is the first time to visit the shop, he only gave them a drawing of his house, they did not go to the actual site to measure the house and they were able to give him a report saying that the house was 135 square meters and cost 7 million. roughly, they gave him a sketch of the materials used in the house and they did not know what the materials were.
Their second trick is that when they arrive at the shop, they take away the money ( except if they have enough experience and they manage the discussion ) .
In Shropshire, at any time of the year, they will invite their manager to come and tell him that he has fulfilled his contract and that he is now free to negotiate with other clubs. At this point, they are able to offer him a higher salary.
This was a big pit, he was a victim of a big fraud and he was forced to pay one million dollars.. At the time, he was in a state of panic and he was forced to pay one million dollars..
He gave him a report with many problems, 7 million were not included in the water and electric reforms, did not include any doors and bathrooms, while the three were the basic construction costs.
Apart from these, their service fees are also higher than those of other companies..
He lost confidence in the company from the beginning, he did not say clearly what he wanted to sign a contract.
When he went to get the money back, they displayed a very experienced manner, with a special small group of fighters coming to fight him.
Regardless of whether, regardless of how, the death of a passenger is a problem for the airline, it is not the airline's responsibility.
All kinds of accusations have been made against him, and there are many minor details that have been revealed, all of which have caused him to cry, in general, he has not been able to choose his friends because his friend's house was also poor in quality.
They were originally made to look like dragon heads,, but now they are made to look like monkeys,, but they have been dismantled and reassembled to look like other animals..
hence, most people do not choose to work with this type of construction company.
Later on, everyone at the time chose to do so because of the cost of the renovation, the small amount of money.
Want to ask the merchants, they must first register or sign up.
A strict prohibition on the publication of all forms of criticism of the merchandise market, with the exception of a detailed description of the merchandiser's voice.

This is so scary that in 30 minutes, it is impossible to talk, and it is necessary to cancel the reservation..
It is difficult to find another way to do it,, for example, changing the location.
It is good, and then he would not cancel the dialogue, if he did not pay him for 5 to 10 days, he would follow up.
He asked for 15 minutes but it is not possible to cancel.

As the last major flow star shower of 2012, the triple star shower in the constellation of Double Crescent was scheduled to take place on October 14, after midnight. It was expected to be the most spectacular flow star shower of the year.
In 2018, November 13,, a double star in the constellation of Sagittarius was photographed by the astronomer in Beijing.
The majority of the flowing star dust from the mother star bodies are periodical brown dwarf stars,, but the double star system flowing star dust from the mother star bodies is a 3200th- magnitude small planetary star that is similar to the Apollonis type of small planetary star..
A double star system with two stars orbiting each other, one of which is a flowing star. This is currently the second known double star system to have a flowing star.
The chairman of the Tianjin Astronomical Society, Tianjin Astronomical Observatory specialist Liangping said that the same phenomenon occurs in the last month of the year,, " the first appearance period can last from 12th to 17th of the month.
This flowing star rain has a large flow volume and is stable, is called the Northern Hemisphere's three major flowing star rain..
A double star with a distinctive feature is that the star's speed is slower, its color is richer and the star is a flowing star. The double star is also suitable for observing with a telescope and for filming by amateur astronomers.
Tianjin city astronomy enthusiast Yang Bing on 13 December 2020 in Tianjin recorded a double star flowing star.
Astronomical forecast shows that the double star flow star rain will reach its maximum on 12 October at 15: 00 hours left. at that time, the pulsation point is located at the top of the sky and the number of flow stars is estimated to be 150 per hour.
A double star system with a rain shower.
" The previous year' s " double star flow star rain left a deep impression on people, but the double star flow star rain of this year will be affected by the moon' s light interference. the brightness of the phenomenon would be diminished.
On the 14th of the 11th month of the 14th year of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11th month of the 11
He likes to watch the falling stars with his friend in the evening after sunset, but he has to be careful to avoid cold and protect himself from the cold..
In other words, it is possible to observe more flowing stars.
There is no disagreement in the construction of the city, it can be located in the countryside or in a rural village with a height of 100 meters and a viewing area of 100 meters. After the sun sets, it can be observed.
It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that the double star's flowing star rain is emitted in all directions and the flow rate is very large, it is not possible to observe the double star 's flowing star rain directly at the star 's pulsation point.
He likes filming with his friend, he wants to shoot a big- budgeted film, he chooses a wide- angle lens with a large light bubble. he uses high ISO and a large light bubble during filming.
Based on stability and continuity, the three--legged base, a prepared electric battery and a fast door line are also necessary. "

First,, a high- energy laser television more focused on a large screen market.
Compared to liquid crystal television, the whole- city market position of the medium light television is more focused on the large screen, or that the medium light television itself is for the large screen.
Currently, the mainstream liquid crystal television screen size is between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the ultra- bright light television screen size is between 75 inches and 100 inches. The largest ultra- bright light television screens exceeded 100 inches.
In recent years, the output volume and sales volume of laser television in the whole world have increased significantly, the proportion of the total output volume and sales volume of television exceeded six percent. In the 80-inch and above television, the proportion of the total output volume and sales volume of television exceeded six percent.
According to the forecast of the Chinese Ministry of Health, in 2020, the sales volume of laser television increased by more than 140 percent and continued to increase at a high speed.
The reason for the success of the big screen in the market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of the medium-- laser television in the area of protecting the eyes.

The Chinese Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute and the Beijing Institute of Physical Chemistry and Biophysics used the same conditions to observe the mild light television and the liquid crystal television and concluded that there were 144 groups of test data.
Data evidence confirms that ultraviolet laser television cameras have a very strong protective eye characteristic in specific areas, even to a certain degree of improvement.
In the field of vision health, the use of high- intensity light has become more widespread and attracted more users. It also opened a new market for colorful television.
The second is the high- intensity light- emitting laser television more focused high end market.
Unlike liquid crystal televisions, the price of the ultra- bright light emitting television does not fall continuously, and the price of the television is currently in the range of millions of yuan. As the size of the television increases and the light source is upgraded, the price of the television gradually decreases.
A powerful laser television that is sold for a huge amount of money.
There is a reason for this..
In the light source and technology advancement, it is continuously developing, that there are many types of liquid crystal television and film that are not able to achieve the superiority.
Due to the use of ultra-short- range projector technology, the use of a laser beam to project a 100- inch large screen, which requires a relatively small space, while the main machine is small and the use of land is very small.
In terms of brightness,, a large-- scaled LED television can reach 2000 lumens or more.
The amount of heat generated is lower, the damage to the equipment is less and the lifespan of the television is also longer.
In addition to this, there are many high-- end 4K ultra high definition television sets that also feature real 4K ultra high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, simulated human beings, and other cutting- edge technologies that are able to give viewers a more intense visual and auditory experience.

A simple way to say is that the ultra- wide angle near intense light film is not able to use the expensive super wide angle transmission and reflection lens, which does not conform to the best design of optics.
To shield part of the environment from light, use a micro-structured phosphor film as a replacement for a 65 inch screen, at a basic cost of $65 million..
There is also one point, he particularly dislikes the way film studios sell their films to cinemas, where they are projected onto the screen.

The make-up was done after which the filming began. The filming was done in a very relaxed manner and with a sense of humor.
After filming was completed, he chose four of the most popular scenes from the film and re--edited them to create a more emotional ending.
It has been 3 days without a response, due to their system not being able to recognise him as a member of the PRS, and therefore he is unable to join the monthly pay bill.

A small umbrella bought protection and stood up..
The small rain umbrella is an internet- based protective aid advocacy group.

The small rain umbrella protective product is only the third medium between the two.
From the point of view of the paying system,, the Internet platform's product because of the lack of a commercial base and the lack of salary and wage expenditures, and the salary and wage expenditures of the employees, therefore, the cost of the Internet platform's product is relatively high,, while the paying method is flexible and flexible, it is possible to maximize the pressure on the release of the security industry's salary and wage expenditures.
This point is still very good..
It can be tested.

Together with a friend, he talks about the most recent decline of 26 percent in the company's market value, a drop of 2510 million US dollars, and the return of the company's former competitors.
Meta ( formerly known as Facebook ) is an advertising company, its main source of income comes from advertisements. Today, the company is one of the most profitable advertising companies in the world.
Facebook , Instagram , Whatsapp , etc. , regardless of any kind of functionality, are all part of Meta's flow of traffic.
In addition to this,, Meta is still the largest advertising alliance, many advertisements from outside are broadcast through the advertising platform of the alliance.
However,, the times have changed.
First,, because of the pineapple fruit's secretive privacy policy, it was difficult to obtain user 's data information, this affected the effectiveness of the advertisement broadcast.
Pineapple fruit now has a hidden privacy policy, the vast majority of people's normal reaction is not to allow the app to obtain its own information.
The next time if Google cuts another slice, the impact on Meta's revenue would be even greater.
The second reason for the decline in METall' s income was the weakening of the China factor ( the importance of this factor is not clear, but it still exists ) .
In reality, there is a lot of business activity in China.
Every year, Meta loses about 10 percent of its income, this is mainly due to the fact that Chinese business companies contribute.
The Hong Kong branch of the company has about 4,000 employees, there are also a number of large representatives in the mainland.
The Chinese company wants to expand its overseas market and the broad advertisement channel is the main source of money. Most of the money was given to Meta.
There is a sense of rivalry between the two main competitors, TT, but in the last two years, TT has been able to win a lot of money.
In the United States, all of the country's representatives are in the company's advertisement campaigns, in China, the company 's business performance is also very good.
Most recently, he has not devoted himself to the study of it, but he is not sure that it is not as good as before.
The Chinese company in the overseas market has already reached the stage of burning money.
The third new flow channel is not expanding as expected.
Facebook became more and more old, the new pack included TT in the internal platform, were not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the drop in income, but the lack of expected growth.
The city' s market is not only concerned with current revenue, more importantly, it is concerned with the future prospects of the city.
It is very clear that Meta' s forecast is not enough.
For the purpose of giving the city market a new story, the actor Gareth Cockburn spoke about the " original universe " .
The original universe is not a futuristic direction, but the original universe' s realization period is longer than that of the metro area. Therefore, the story in the two to three years is not enough to support the metro area.
Therefore, the past two years have been the most difficult period for the company.
