The Ware cost less than 20 euros.

He is a member of the #PRS # organization and therefore it is not a problem for him.
All he needed was a number or an order to put on the package so that it could be tracked back to him..
A few days ago, he ordered the PRS Org for 249 euros.
Today it costs 179 euros.
I find this, honestly speaking, very annoying.
If he has to cancel the order and re-order for a better price or there is another way to get a refund.
He also believes that children should not be expected to take on the role of a parent for their younger siblings.
However, he thinks that it is also good for the big siblings to take care of the little ones..
Just a quick look, a quick helping hand, bringing the flask..
They learn responsibility, help in the family and are integrated.
As long as they are still young enough to be children,, he sees no problem.
When de's K1 is alone for a short time and it is OK for him, that is good.
He himself can best assess whether it is suitable for his children.
It is not the case that he wraps K2 and spends hours accompanying him while he sleeps.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is also due to the statement of the psychologist.
In the event of something actually happening like a fire, a break--in, an earthquake or an alien invasion, it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether or not this is a risk that he wants to take is up to his discretion.
Helping him to find the title of a book again.
He remembers having read a crime or thriller novel a few years ago and he can still remember almost all of the plot, but he cannot remember the title.
The story was about fear and how to cure it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by dousing himself in food and entering the lions' enclosure.
The case is taken over by a Commissarin who, after a short investigation, is assigned to the therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with a fear of hospitals.
The Commissar has a small niece who also has a fear ( of fire ) and lands at this therapist's place.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist, a photographer who is commissioned anonymously to go to the site of the suicide and to document and upload the photos to the internet.
It turns out that this therapist runs an underground therapy group where the patients have a chip implanted in the brain that suppresses an anxiety center, and the patients end up overcoming their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window and another is driving herself to death on purpose )
This fight against the fear is called " the fight " in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic of the man who had a fire to do with..
This is the basic plot of the original book written by a French author or authoress.
If this action is known to someone or even if the title of the book is revealed, he would be very happy.
Oh, the password for the WLAN is not available.
He must first contact his husband.
However, it can take a long time.

Because of Omicron, Johnson wants to push ahead with the Auffrischimpfing.
There are always new cases of the Omikron strain in the United Kingdom.
Until New Year's Eve, all adults in England were to receive an offer to be vaccinated.
London - the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson intends to be ahead of the rapid increase in the number of cases of the Omikron strain than originally planned.
Every adult in England would be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, if three months had passed since the second vaccination,, the Prime Minister said in a pre--recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The British government would also provide additional support to speed up the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
He is facing the threat of the Omikron variant, which means that the immunization protection must be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news was that the protection level with a third dose of the vaccine would be increased again.
"It's now time for the boosters., said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more cases of the Omikron strain were recorded in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, there was an increase of 65 percent. DPA.

He is in favor of everyone using pronouns.
He has sent an application.
Today, the invitation to a meeting was delivered by mail.
He wants to respond to the email..
However, the name is not Peter, but a somewhat more complicated name.
He has been Googled and depending on his or her cultural background, he or she is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how he should write the email now.
I would like someone to help him.
He is an immigrant and does not want to have a police officer on his feet.
The conclusion is that everyone should be aware of pronouns.

[CW ) The feeling when he can't help.
The content of the article is about domestic violence.
I have to write something from the heart.
He (21) is often in contact with the victims and perpetrators of domestic violence due to his job.
One of the themes that really bothered him and which is unfortunately very common is that many victims do not help themselves or think that they could not help them.
It is clear to him that they are not able to do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in his profession that move him more than when he cannot do anything in such situations.
He sees the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes.
Even in a conversation between four people, with the perpetrator far outside the range of sight and hearing, he cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of the children from this leaving it.
What he always wants to make clear is that it is possible to live peacefully without violence, even close to tears.
I want all women to know that they do not have to accept violence..
He often wishes that he could be there to help,, but knows that he cannot..
It becomes easier as a result,, but never easier.
Beneath, he always thinks of the fact that it is worth living without violence, that is so unthinkably important..
" Arcane " on Netflix - " League of Legends "

Basketball Bundesliga - Derby Debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim.
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
For the second time within less than three months, the Giants lost to Crailsheim - and how.
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had commented on the cup defeat against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in October with the remark " they still have a bit of anger in their belly ".
After the game, he has not been laid down, but has instead increased after the 61-72 (28-38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
However, more than the naked result, it was the manner of the performance that disappointed.
Represented by a statistic, the entire Dilemma is expressed: The triple percentage was only 13 percent, 4 goals ( all of them from the young Johannes Patrick ) from a total of 31 attempts - questions remain.
The response from John Patrick was " After the victory at Teneriffa, they were not concentrated enough and did not execute what they had trained. "
To move the ball.
Ganz different reacted his counterpart Sebastian Gleim: " A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time. said the happy coach.
"It has felt like being in front of 10,000 people.
There were only 750 spectators allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday,, but they came at their own expense.
In addition to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory,.
"The best player he ever coached " praised Gleim.
Whilst in Patrick's team, the key performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh ( 7 points ) failed to perform on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22 - 15) the Giants prevented a total disaster and came as close as eight points, after being 39 – 59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
However, a lot of time is still left to argue.
The Giants received the Skyliners from Frankfurt on Wednesday (19:00) before a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.

Federal Minister of the Interior Klara Geywitz: Through expropriation, no new housing is created.
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing conglomerates as demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
" With an expropriation, no new housing is created, only the ownership structure changes. " Geywitz said in an interview with the " Tagesspiegel " ( Sunday ) .
His goal is to give tenants the security that their rent will remain affordable in the next years.
A varied mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations, is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Green Party and the Left Party will set up an expert commission to deal with the results of the people's vote.
However, when the situation did not improve, Geywitz was still in talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement stipulates a miet price ceiling until 2029, a limitation of tenant increases in overcrowded housing markets and the expansion of the miet spigel.
He would meet with the Justice Minister to try to implement it as quickly as possible.
When the rental market does not calm down,, the SPD politician said that she and her coalition partners would discuss further steps.

At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky.
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes swept across the United States.
Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths could be blamed.
The pictures from there resemble a war zone.
In the night of Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe damage and possibly hundreds of deaths in the United States.
The storms left an approximately 320 km long swath of destruction, particularly in the state of Kentucky.
Dessen Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere where the tornado passed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops and government buildings are to be demolished.
Parts of industrial buildings and roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that it is possible.
He estimates that there are up to 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, the official numbers rise daily.

Companies pay bonuses for vaccinations and change their advertising slogans.
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for an immunization bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offer their employees money bonuses for the immunization.
They are on the same line as the Social Partners OGB and the Economic Chamber, who today demanded financial incentives for a vaccination.
Also, the transformation of advertising slogans into appeals for Corona vaccinations, after the German example, is intended to increase the willingness to take part in Corona vaccinations.

In their Onlineshop, kitchenpoint, they sell all the Smeg kitchen equipment and the corresponding accessories.
They scrutinize the quality and completeness of their orders.
The new coffee vending machine from Smeg brings freshly ground coffee into the kitchen or the office.
The simple and reduced design, the plastic surface in matte colors in combination with the matte- polished stainless steel front make the new SMEg coffee vending machine with milk dispenser a design object.
The reduced design allowed all functions, such as the choice of the amount of grain and the amount of water, as well as the choice between an espresso, an Americano, a Ristretto and a mild coffee, to be determined by four switches.
Thanks to the Dampflanze, it is also possible to produce coffee milk and milk foam specialities..
Help with the first own campaign.
Boron to greet.
He is currently leading a group of four friends through the Abenteuer Over the Greifenpass and wants his heroes to seamlessly move into an independently written campaign.
They play DSA 5.
The great arc has been made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been imagined and now he is busy writing the opening adventure and has already stumbled over his own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes must transport a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
It is here that the further development of the story will take place.
A few miles from the village, the hero is ambushed by a group of goblins.
He wants to give the player characters the possibility to solve the confrontation in different ways: to persuade, to act or to threaten, and to recognize the danger early on, which also always occurs to the players.
8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears and 6 armed with bows and swords.
The Goblins hide in the Nichtbemerken and ambush the hero in a hollow way, flanking him to the left and right with bows, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, he has two solutions.
The heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a halfelf.
The carriage is, of course, gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, the halfelf with two of his knights joins in and comes to the hero's aid in the battle.
The carriage is still there, everything is going well.
Deus ex Machina of Lösion 2 does not need to be translated.
The Encounter as an introduction to the adventure is too much.
The Group of Goblins later plays a decisive role and is not only cannon fodder.
Edit: I was not expecting so many responses, in particular not with so many good suggestions and tips.
He will be guaranteed to accept many of their ideas and now has more confidence in his narrative.
He took the lamp apart again.
and again, joined together.

Transport costs and time savings, at the same time reducing the burden on the environment.
If he needs more than one article, he must first click on " now buy " when he has all the articles in the warehouse.

Faster delivery with DHL, DPD and the German Post.
Normally, Deine Sendings are sent out by Deine Sendings at 14:00 Uhr, at the latest..
In order to ensure that his package arrives at him as quickly as possible, he must also pay attention to the fact that his address is complete and that his name is on his mailbox and his bell.
He would like to send his package to a packing station.
Then he chose DHL, because only DHL is allowed to deliver at DHL packing stations.
They sent him an email with the flight number if he had chosen DHL or DPD as the carrier.
Therefore, he can see where his package is located as early as 22:00.
His satisfaction is their goal - all five stars count.
If he is satisfied with them, they would be happy if he gave them a positive assessment and awarded all five stars.
If it ever happens that not all to his fullest satisfaction has been achieved, he would be grateful if he reported to them before giving a rating.
Only in this way, they have the chance to do everything they can to make him happy..
They have nothing to do with the chair.
The Rift was once there.
He has been sitting there for a long time..
The lower part was damaged, thus the part with storage space was damaged.
Then everything is taken away or only the storage area.
He is frustrated with Sky Sport F1.
Dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality of the German Sky broadcasts has decreased, so that he wanted to make a little noise with this post.
For the first time today, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 coverage to begin on time.
However, due to the delayed start and the start accident, the time plan was far behind the planning, but the last ( planned ) ten minutes as well as the championship decision could still be shown.
Apparently, from a legal point of view, F1 has priority, and as a result, all other broadcasts must be restricted,, so that Sky DE had no choice in the matter.
Despite being dumb, the fact that Sky UK broadcasted the race to the end is particularly annoying.
Despite this, a small compliment to the commentator Olivier Zwartyes, who has followed the difficult situation around the heavy accident well.
Then, there was again a lack of knowledge among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, who did not know that it is possible to change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone in 2014, it was not until after the exchange of messages between Hamilton and Verstappen on the issue of changing the tires that both came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change the tires.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately realized that Verstappen had this possibility.
He is of the opinion that such basic rules should be known when commenting on Formula 1 on a pay- television channel..
It is also not the first time that Rätselraten has been in conflict with the regulations, both of which are constantly uncertain in the matter of regulations.
In general, Roos' use of the artificial commentary style does not appeal to him, but he admits that it is a matter of taste.
However, he likes Heiko Wasser from RTL better..
This is accompanied by constant silliness, both of which are unprofessional and make the reporter, Peter Hardenacke, and Ralf Schumacher's "UuuuuHD " look amateur.
In particular, the latter brings total chaos to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Finally, the advertising takes over at Sky, in the final round, Sky is the only channel that broadcasts advertisements during the race, as F1 TV can only broadcast the race without commentary after the race.
Neither Servus TV or ORF do this.
Both of these channels also have less advertising in their training sessions than Sky, and as a free-to air channel.
However, Glock and Baumgartner must be praised for their work, but this alone does not allow one to overlook the shortcomings.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programme is also very thin and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is the worst German--speaking channel to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are allowed to broadcast until the end of the season..
In other words, the grandiose F1 season was made less enjoyable than it would have been with a decent broadcaster.
Mich would like to know their opinion.
On the other side of the room, there is a pendulum light with a bronze and multi-coloured glass shade..
Hello, he has an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and has still not been delivered.
He has contacted the chat twice and nothing has come of it..
The First Lady told him that it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told him that she would review and send it, but she never responded.
Hello, on 12 December 2019, he ordered two PRS orgs.
One of them has already shown a defect ( the material has a hole on the front part of the stool )
He is asking for help.
Lifter pumps are well suited to supplying oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system over the air heater.
This series is offered in 3 variants by them.
At the end of the offer, they look at the table.
Here, they can see the differences between the two.
If the pumps are strong enough, it is possible to run entire facilities with them.
Those with a large aquarium are suitable for pumps with 2 or more outflows, so that multiple outflows can be connected.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model, but louvre pumps are also suitable,, e.g. to set an accent in the aquarium with an air curtain ( available in the shop ) or to transform the air bubbles into a function.
There would have been a treasure chest, a shell or something similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-proofed construction, which ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by a 4 to 6 mm air hose to an Auströmer o.a. and can then start.
The ventilator pump should be the same or higher than the water level and placed outside.
The water pump is placed lower than the water level, a backward- flowing ventil should be placed in between.
The air tube was simply cut and the ventilator was placed in between.
This would be prevented if the water would flow backward, and the water from the basin would flow through the pump.
If the ventilator pump is placed in the open air,, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though it is stated in eBay that the processing time is 3 days, it is packed every day and the packages are picked up every day.
On the road, everything is going well, it goes very fast.
They want to only slightly pre-empt, so that no one is upset, only because it lasted a little longer than expected.
It would be so that not everyone has understanding for the whole employees who also work in the freight transportation industry. There is no pause in the freight transportation industry.
He must not be judged in the same way, only because the delivery has been delayed, this is solely the responsibility of the courier companies.
The Dienes are often criticized, even though they say that they are having a hard time at the moment.
This is also regional very different.
They are not to be blamed, they are to remain healthy and they all hope for better times to come.
how long it takes for the yellow to be ordered with and without armrests.
It was also possible to buy the legs in a light color.
Astronaut daughter and TV host are sent into space by the founder of Amazon.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers had a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday from the rocket system " New Shepard " of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the roughly ten- minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally greeted the newly- knighted astronauts upon their return.
" Welcome back, he said in a blue space suit, as he opened the capsule door.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers stepped out one after the other and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds in the air and reached a height of 10,700 meters.
The 74 year old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998, after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50 year old TV host Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets. Aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they each paid for their tickets was not revealed by Blue Origin.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminisced after the short flight about the mission of her father.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his assignments.
She was simply just happy, said the 74-year old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm..
He would like to go back to space as soon as possible, said the moderator.
" New Shepard " flies up to 100 kilometers.
The rocket system " New Shepard " flies mostly autonomously.
During the flight of the rocket, the capsule was detached and reached a height of around 100 kilometres above the Earth, at times experiencing weightlessness, before it was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Traffic Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was the third manned flight of Blue Origin, the first was in July, when Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82 year old former US pilot and an 18 year old Dutchman.
At the second one in October, the 90- year old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became famous for his role as " Captain Kirk " in " Star Trek " was there, as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing the business of space tourism with little scientific interest for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Perfectly, it is true, he needs nothing else.
They only need the tracking number on his mail.
A person who works or studies in the field of biochemistry.
He is currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and finds the subject in itself quite interesting, and the laboratory does not bother him ( he has already completed the inorganic chemistry practicum.
He had already been informed about his career prospects prior to the start of his studies, but he also thought at the time that he would study until the completion of his doctorate.
At the moment, he has doubts, especially concerning his career prospects.
On the one side ( Studycheck etc ) one hears again and again super job opportunities and the job is totally sought after, on the other side one hears again and again of unemployed biologists and poorly paid jobs.
I would really like to see that..
As they are currently working on.
They are satisfied with their work and salary.
3)What they have studied and what they have been trained in.
I would do it all over again.
Many thanks for their responses.

Extra stress before holidays and holiday weekends.
This topic came up last week with him.
He had to now use his long weekend to unwind.
Therefore, only now a post was erected.
Not only during the large holidays,, such as the Christmas holidays,, there is great stress in the company.
As it seems, there are them also during holidays and bridging holidays.
It was the day of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which in Switzerland is known as " Auffahrt " .
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses take a bridge day, which is therefore semi- official.
There was a long 4- day weekend in the house last week.
Last week,.
Everywhere there is stress.
Lots of urgent emails that had to be dealt with before the long weekend,, all of which had to be dealt with before the long weekend.
Because of this,, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that, because of that
Because " next week then " after so much time sounds and it is not allowed.
or because the people all seriously in a shortened week want to achieve as much as in a normal one.
Not only he was stressed on Wednesday, he was also very aggravated.
This self--imprisonment because of holidays.
Whatever, they still have holidays,, but they are not allowed to celebrate them properly.
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent of each other.
My question is simply that only the Swiss are like this..
This is the reformed evangelical way.
or they know it in the north as well.

Nekton Bio facilitates a smooth molt and the formation of new feathers.
Nekton Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals and 200,000 micrograms of biotin per kilogram.
Nekton Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of the wing injuries occurring in the care of birds are caused by feeding errors.
As the feathers are made of protein, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the birds is necessary for the formation of a perfect feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the moult are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate provision of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of Nekton Bio, the disadvantageous ratio of amino acids in most plant--based feed is explicitly considered and balanced.
During the use of Nekton B, no other vitamin supplements should be given.
Nekton Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be fed through the drinking water or the soft food.
Many thanks, he has found it.
It still doesn't work.
The DDR Handcrafted model of the Altbau E 95 steam locomoter of the German Reichsbahn, the locomoter was in use in Silesia and Mitteldeutschland, the very rare locomoter comes from the 1968 modification proposal of the Model Train Maker's magazine Heft 11, used with play marks and missing parts, the Baureihe E 95 is a heavy freight train steam locomoter of the German Reichsbahn, which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, it is possible that the bauset also came from the small series firm Zschutschke and Bachmann.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle ( Saale ) and is operational.
The German Reichsbahn Society had the AEG commissioned in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive capable of transporting 2,200 tons of coal and 530 tons of passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/ h.
The maximum speed was 65 km / h.
The DRG decided in March 1926 that the locomotive would be delivered as a 1 "Co + Co 1 " locomotive with Tatzlager drive from AEG with the delivery of the mechanical parts by Siemens- Schuckertwerke with the delivery of the electrical parts.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01 – 06.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves afterwards in the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
In the Reich Railroad Improvement Works in Dessau, all six locomotives were found to be suitable for rebuilding.
As the reelectrification of the middle German network progressed, there was a growing demand for locomotives for the heavy freight train service, and in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01, E 95 02 and E 95 03 were reworked, with the other locomotives serving as replacement parts.
The E 04s, E 44s and E 94s that were available in larger numbers were given priority.
Only after the E 94 was withdrawn, the E 95 became the focus of the rehabilitation.
At first, the locomotives were stationed at the Bahnbetriebswerk Leipzig- Wahren.
They came to the Bahnbetriebswerk Halle P in 1960.
They were used in a separate rotation plan mostly for coal trains from the Geiseltal heading towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic.
It was often the case that Schütze would remain stuck on the sidelines when it came to decisions..
Then, the on this locomotive constantly travelling Beimann with a hammer and an axe had to dismantle the gun during the journey.
Damage to the Fahrmotors occurred more often and led to month-long outages of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new locomotives were available and a significant expansion of the electrified network was not planned at the time, so the Reichsbahn was able to dispose of the E 95s and the majority of the splitter types.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn's electrical locomotives only wanted to be manned by one person, due to the difficulties with the machinery and the visibility from the driver's cabin, which had led to problems in the operation of the trains.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid 1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which withdrew from service on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was used as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a track heating plant at the Hauptbahnhof Halle.
It took some time for the Reichsbahn authorities to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initially external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of being able to present it in the RAW Dessau as a showpiece.
From 1959, she belonged to the Museum of Transport in Dresden as a non- operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
In the DB Museum Halle ( Saale ) the museum locomotive is cared for.
Since 1995, Mitarbeiter of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational rehabilitation of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be exhibited for the first time at the Museums' BW Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job, while the transformers were overhauled and five locomotives were operational.
The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Silesian Mountains Railway and its branch lines, where they proved their reliability and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to the Mitteldeutsche network.
The main area of operations was initially Silesia.
The H0 handwork model in the OVP box is in good working condition, it has optical repairs to the locomotive, it is dusty and has traces of play, it is a very rare handwork model, it may have come from the small series firm Zschutschke and Bachmann.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
The F- parts are it.
He received a bed from them.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet, unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.

At him, they are not flat.
It could have been sent to him.
Hallo #Name#,, he should explain the problem to him again.
A house fire with two lightly injured and high damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a house in Oberbayern.
In addition, damage in the six--digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport on the grounds of the neighboring house in Kinsau ( Landsberg am Lech County ) .
Two residents were taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect a deliberate fire.
The Kripo of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
Then,, however,, it comes much later.
And he has to pay the shipping costs again.
To counter Fake News, Biontech CEo publishes an Impf photo.
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in 2021 on the social network " LinkedIn " .
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously spoken publicly about his vaccination status.
Now, the entrepreneur published a photo of his coronavirus vaccination..
The illness of a friend led him to make this decision,, Şahin said.
The CEO and co---founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccine against the Coronavirus.
In the social media, there were false reports that he was not vaccinated.
In fact, his wife and he have received three doses of the Biontech- Pfizer vaccine, he wrote on Friday in an article in the network " LinkedIn " .
"For several months, friends have urged him to post a photo of him being vaccinated, to counter the false rumors.
He had previously rejected it because the communication did not revolve around him personally.
But a call in the previous week changed his opinion: "He was deeply saddened when he learned that an old school friend of his is currently fighting for his life..
He is fighting against a severe case of the disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often caused by misinformation and mistrust. "
Fear is hard to overcome with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In the Internet, circulated an interview with the German Wave, in which Uğur Şahin said that he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as well as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
" At that time, it was illegal for him to receive the vaccine himself. "
There is a priority in the distribution of the vaccine in Germany.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been abolished - and the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in the Umspannanlage and thousands of people without electricity.
In several municipalities in North Rhine- Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening, there was no electricity and in many cases no heating.
A Brand had a spanning station shut down.
After a fire with severe damage to a power station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine- Sieg district of North Rhine- Westphalia were without electricity for 24 hours.

Firefighters and members of the THW provided assistance in the municipalities.
The authorities offered shelter in schools and called on neighbors to help.
The supplier thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
They are aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
They also thanked the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their unremitting efforts.
The repair of the damage would still take several days, as the Westnetz workers were only able to temporarily reopen some of the lines. he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to the company's statement.
The water is flowing again.
The fire that broke out at 19:15 on Friday has, according to Westnetz, heavily damaged parts of the 10,000 volt switching station in Neunkirch- Seelscheid.
Detailed cleaning and repair works were necessary.
At the same time, an attachment to a 30,000 volt level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 18 Uhr, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth again had electricity.
Further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen- Seelscheid were gradually added from 21.30.
Since 23.15 hours, also the last still affected by the power outage had received electricity.
More than 80 workers from Westnet and partner companies were involved.
The authorities had after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon also called for neighborhood assistance.
It is important now for the citizens to take care of the elderly and lonely people in their neighborhoods and to report to the local fire brigade headquarters when help is needed,, said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The main focus was on the inhabitants of old people's homes when it came to setting up and operating the emergency power plants.
In addition, according to Behördenangagement, temporary care places were set up in schools for those who were not able to care for themselves or those who were dependent on power-ed medical equipment.

It is a blue-- green raincoat.
I hope they also have a beautiful day and remain healthy ♡.
But he can't put the substructure on the table plate.
It is a custom called # Name #.
There are 3 versions of it.
They wanted plates with a diameter of # Number.
They have a diameter of 155 cm.
Today, his PRS Organization came,, but he could not fit it in together and thus shorten it.
He could help him further.
Otherwise, he would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose.
He would have been pleased to receive a response.
It's really easier.
Then they make it so.
Send him the return receipt by mail.
The repair is now complete.
He had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, he had not restarted the EPRS.
I should do this now.
Such a low Gutschrift is almost unacceptable.
With this, they are not in agreement.
Nordic Combination : Riiber wins.
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid were on the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Defeated, the duo again had to give way to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a large lead after the ski jump in the Loipe.
Return of the task number.
When the money is returned to his account.
They have both been upgraded to version 4.5.
It is possible that they had heard of the problem before.
He has directly with his PRS organisation bought a book, it seems to be about it.
When he opens the door, the message comes out, upside down.
This document could not be opened.
The file may be defective and they should report it to the customer service.
As far as he can see, it is a PRS org epub file.
They can help him further.
Chat Connection is broken and now.
He also has to work in between..
In order for the coloring to be even and clean, he should clean the parts with a little soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse it with clear water and dry it.
Before the pencil touches the model for the first time with a new color, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
This can be done on the inside of the building or on a yoghurt cup..
The first stroke on the building.
He draws the pencil evenly, stroke by stroke.
The overlapping of the color layers later creates a uniform surface.
Avoid rapid back and forth strokes with the pencil.
This results in unrealistically shaped areas.
A model is not a fence.
Begin with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark could later shine through.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come at the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metallic streaks can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Lasse the painted parts dry for a day before destroying them.
The original appearance of the models is achieved by the decals or abrasion figures.
From the emblems on aircraft to ship names, to decorative strips and identification marks on automodels, the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Bringing the decals in the right order, while the parts are still reachable.
A plane's cockpit is easier to install before it is attached to the fuselage..
More important than the right tools, such as scissors, pinchers and toothpicks, are patience and a steady hand during the gluing process.
He cuts out each required decal individually and arranges them accordingly.
Decals are also known as water-color pictures, because the back side of the decal is moistened with water until the backing paper becomes dark.
Dann he moves Du the picture only a small piece of paper and places the piece on the corresponding place on the model ( which he had previously moistened ) .
Whilst Du holds the decal on the model with a tool, he pulls away the backing paper on the side.
Attention to the fact that the picture must be removed from the paper in such a way that it does not stick to the finger, wrinkle or tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years.
He can only open the book for a short time as soon as he looks at something else, then he can no longer read the book and has to withdraw and rejoin and reopen the book and look for the place where he has read.
On Saturday, he had already communicated with them.
I received this by email.
Also for all 3 packages.
However, the lamp came in three separate packages to him.
Despite this,, he deserves a lot of thanks..
Then, when the money is returned, he would go elsewhere to buy.
It is easy for him to get it back.
Childbearing treatment at the PKV and the meaning of the term " accident "
Hello together,
They had been in the custody of the Children's Welfare Board for some time, and now, when it comes to the settlement with the PKV,, the children's welfare board suddenly stands in the way.
The Series after.
They had the Children's Welfare Board at the PKV in the foreground and were granted three attempts.
The experiments were not limited in any way ( e.g. time, success, etc. ) .
The first attempt led directly to the successful pregnancy and birth and was compensated by the PKV.
A few months later, they attempted to have a second child, and carried out two ( unsuccessful ) attempts, which they attributed to the PKV.
They applied again for the costs to be reimbursed by the PKV and were granted three more attempts.
After several more attempts ( they had more attempts than agreed upon, logically the most expensive ones ) they submitted the bills to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise that instead of 5 attempts ( 2 and 3 ) the PKV would only reimburse 3 attempts.
The explanation is that with pregnancy and birth, the other two attempts of the first promise fail.
The second Children's Wish was a new case.
According to the AGB, the accident begins with the healing process and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists.
The questions to the experts in the round here.
Who has the right here is the PKV ( only 3 attempts are reimbursed ) or they ( there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed ).
If the PKV had warned them that the next attempts would be forfeited with a birth.
The desire for a second child is a new cause for concern.
The inability to conceive ( caused by blocked sperm tubes ) is not healed by the first child.
It would be super if the experts here would give their opinion.
Many thanks for the first time for their help.
He can give him the three variants by email and tell him the best way to reach him.
In order.
They will not be getting any more from them..
When they add up the revenues of him and his friend # Name # ( the same address ) they have apparently lost good customers.
They can pass this on to their manager without hesitation.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, his colleague told him that the reimbursement had been ordered and now he says that he must first send the thing back.
He can't do anything to prevent the commode from being completely destroyed in his house.
He should see the screenshot written by his colleague.
It is clear and clear that the reimbursement was ordered and he has never received a reimbursement from the PRS organization.
They can arrange with their manager that they have lost two Stammkunden.
His friend has also ordered various pieces of furniture for their apartment through his account..
This is no longer being done..
However, the defect did not become apparent until several months later.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell him as a desk chair.
Regardless of this,, the guarantee period is 24 months.
It is not possible for him to obtain another type of packaging.
He would dismantle the cabinet and hand it over to the transport company so that it could be transported.
A good day, he has a question to his series of PRS Org.
These products are advertised with additional hockers, which are unfortunately not available at them..
They can help.
The theme of the week is the best low budget films.
A low budget film is a film with a low budget. There is no general definition of what a low budget film is, and there are no exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say about it.
A low budget film or low budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are many lists of low- budget films on the Internet,, for example on Letterboxd.
They are interesting representatives of this category.
What attracts them to it.
and what fell to the ground, was overwhelmingly negative..
He is a very good acquaintance of them, has already set up two complete apartments with their furniture.
Wanted the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time was now extended again, it is now also reliable.
Many thanks.
With friendly greetings
There is no telephone number, a chat where one has to wait 30 minutes is not a chat.
However, nothing has changed in the waiting position. he will soon give up again, because it simply does not work there.
Hello
" A half victory " against Belarus with high costs for the EU.
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a " half victory " in the conflict with the Belarussian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Association (epd).
The EU has not been able to resolve the conflict in a sustainable manner, the researcher of the Berlin Stiftung for Science and Policy (SWP) said.
This state of stalemate - Belarus is not quite a loser, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
The handling of the people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
There is an " increasing normalization of pushbacks " by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided against it,, it goes at the expense of the fundamental rights.
This development weakened the unity of the Union.
"She can not, apparently, prevail when a member state sets itself in the way and insists on doing its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not allow Frontex, the EU's border protection agency, to gain access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong, an agreement on asylum policy has become more difficult because the line " border guard, border guard, border guard " has been strengthened.
A second attempt to cross the border.
According to the Polish Border Guard, migrants have attempted to enter Polish territory from Belarus again.
55 migrants were arrested in the night of Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokeswoman for the agency on Sunday.
The Polish officials were attacked by the migrants with stones near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday night, a group of 28 migrants overcame the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU is throwing out Alexander Lukaschenko as the dictator in Minsk, with the prospect of being allowed to enter the EU.
Poland and Lithuania closed border crossings according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines. said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination with hard measures and extraterritorial sanctions to operate.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarussian society was not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus would routinely send thousands of people through the border.
Mercedes protested after the controversial Formula 1 final.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrow suspects two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is based on an alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he overtook illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last round and won his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre occurred shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase in which the Dutch driver ahead of him had overtaken.
He tests it.
He speaks with the bank and reports to them again.
thanks for the support.

Judith Hermann read from her novel " Daheim "
In the context of the literary tour " LiteraTour Nord " the author Judith Hermann performed on Friday in the sold- out Blue Note with her latest novel " Daheim " and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced and lives in a house on the coast and is sensitive to the nightly sounds at her front door.
He applied for the return of an article through the contact form the previous day, but has not received an email confirmation or similar.
His question was whether his request had been fulfilled.
It does not have the time for their eccentric chat and poorly delivered Chinese junk from China.
Their mistakes, which they rectify and not all from their household.
Contacting Ms. # Name #.
He can't chat with them every day.
They had met the day before and agreed that each of them would receive an email with a 60 euro subsidy, a renewed order for the PRS Org bedside table and a return ticket.
This e--mail has not been received before..
The Paket wants to deliver the package to PRS Org today..
I want to talk to him.
With friendly greetings.
The Lok Sound 5 Decoder can reproduce 10 channels simultaneously.
Each channel can be recorded with up to 16 bits and 31,250 kHz, providing high- fidelity quality on their equipment.
It is practically no difference to the original in terms of sound.
A Class D audio endstufe with up to 3 watts of output power controls the loudspeakers, which have an impedance between 4 and 32.
The enormous 128 Mbit sound storage provides sufficient capacity.
All the individual sounds can be individually adjusted in terms of volume.
The super- flexible Soundengine without a rigid storyline permits the accurate simulation of all conceivable railway vehicles.
Three independent braking functions and two alternative load scenarios give them the maximum control over their vehicles.
He is sorry, but only because he says he is not an antisemite., which means nothing.
This is the same as when an athlete says he has nothing against foreigners.
They are both not willing to give up.
However, Kollegah constantly reproduces various antisemitic messages.
If one wants to distance oneself, one should simply leave it completely.
Then, he is as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
A person who seriously questions the basis of the theory of evolution is completely lost.
In other words, God has started the whole thing..
As soon as he became a creationist, he had to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is a bunch of nonsense.
And as a result, he is an enemy of science and is not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the telescope should be placed as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic- achromatic shaped lens system allows them to use the lens in a practically error- free manner up to the edge zone.
Lupes are often marked with magnification indications.
These figures apply, however, only to exactly fixed conditions, which seldom correspond to the use conditions.
In order to use their lupes optimally, they are asked to take into account the indications in the table " Technical data " (see the instructions in the packaging).
On the surface of the lens of all optical devices – including telescopes – there are light reflections.
By means of an antireflex surface, these reflections are significantly reduced.
Under optimal use conditions - with the lens close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information is contained in the accompanying instruction manual ( in German and English ) .

The PRS did a very nice and good service, it took a long time to get to a person, but they were very good.
Dear members of the # PRS 's Org. team,
He has already been registered with the Kundenkontakt under the number # Phonenumber #.
But it was called that before..
They can not be sent from England because of the PRS organization.
Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde. in the municipality of Krembz, women search for the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many strange situations at the Christmas tree sale.
Once, a man was even able to return home without his partner, because they could not agree on anything.
Every year he plants about 2000 of them.
In the meantime, the 56-year old has already experienced a number of bizarre situations..
He says that the pre--Christmas period is always a little festive..
And with the voucher.
Otherwise, he is away as a customer.
In the meantime, he has received a defective delivery and now has to pay the full price..
Then, he would also be judged in the same way.
There is no need for discussions about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning spit.
And both have therefore their name.
In English, the equivalent would be something like the " dishwasher ", which is not as attractive sounding.
Problems with fiber optics and Devolo DLan or Magic.
They have had a new glass fibre connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, he has problems with building a stable WiFi network.
Previously, he had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used the Devolo DLan system, which, apart from a few failures, transmitted and received 50 Mbit perfectly.
The new Glasfaser connection sends 500 Mbit to the Fritzbox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the Fritzbox.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the WiFi signal, receives less than the full 500 watts as he moves further away from it ( so a plug that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module receives less than the full 500 watts ) .
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new Glasfaser connection is now even slower than before ( ~ 45 Mbit ).
He also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLAN, but there were also large losses.
It is difficult to explain why so much internet speed is lost over the power line.
And LAN is actually the best solution.
It would have been extremely expensive to lay new LAN cable in the house.
He is really at the end of his rope, because he had to create an extra account in order to get one.
Therefore, he would have been even more pleased to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the Girokonto.
The one who had thought that the Girokonts would now have a period of peace is disappointed.
Whilst many banks have used the autumn to try to get their customers to accept the fee increases of the past, they have also reduced the allowances for negative discounts.
The German Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a ceiling of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the Freebet and quadrupled the Tagesgeld.
In the first step, the border was lowered only for customers of the Postbank division of the conglomerate - to 50,000 euros for Giro and Anlagekonten and 25,000 euros for Tagesgeldkonten.
In the meantime, the lower Freibeträge have been established for the entire German Bank,, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for " new individual agreements with long--standing customers.
The Commerzbank was already down to 50,000 euros before, which still applies, as well as at the Inge Deutschland.
The DKB, which is popular with cost conscious customers, has lowered the freebet levels in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and then to 25,000 euros.
In total, more than 100 banks have a freebet of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Even the Sparda Bank Berlin has reached 25,000 euros. However, there is still a legal dispute with the Consumers' Union, which won in the first instance at the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
In the banks, discussions are already underway about the possibility that the institutes may be obliged to provide compensation in the event that the upper courts declare the negative interest rates in principle to be unlawful and many millions of bank customers have to be reimbursed.
The table for 8 persons was delivered instead of the one for 6 persons.
The undergallery is that for 6 persons.
Jennifer Aniston has a whole Beauty Army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and valley journey.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected by the US magazine " The Hollywood Reporter " as the most influential woman of the year.
For them, the 2021 success of the " Friends " reunion and the continuation of their series " The Morning Show " was the result of a lot of discipline and work.
She has a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers who take care of her appearance.
However,, Aniston said that she allowed herself one chip a day (i.e. a single chip from the bag).
That the hearts of the female and male fans alike are still swayed by her is a miracle.
Perhaps, because they have been unlucky with love and are still looking for the great love.
and the baby wish from the list has been removed.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who questioned him had no idea what was going on with him medically, why he was unable to play.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to hope that success and fame will also bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career, Räikkönen has to retire.
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from the Formula 1 was not as quiet as expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42 year old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a technical error and a minor collision, Räikkönen had to abandon his Alfa Romeo after only half of the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix that the " Ice Man " ended his career in the Motorsport King's class.
His wife Minttu and the two children were also on the trip to the United Arabian Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest achievement was winning the World Championship in 2007 in the Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. DPA.
Friedrich won his 60th World Cup victory - Nolte won the two- man bob. Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
He has calculated that he would have to win nine and a half victories in a season to make it to Cortina 2026, and that he achieved two victories in two days at the Winterberg races.
First, he repelled the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he went from third place to first.
He then altered the material a little and ran on Sunday with a 0.30 second advantage.
With his team Thorsten Margis ( SV Halle , Candy Bauer ( BSC Oberbärenburg ) and Alexander Schiller ( SV Halle ) he defeated the Briton Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We went for a bigger risk today and were rewarded,, said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd consecutive match.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who flies for Stuttgart, came after second place in the previous race to fifth place this time.
Christoph Hafer from the BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race and eighth in the second race.
"If he knew what he was doing differently, he would also do it in the same way. Lochner said.
Nolte with a home victory and a podium for Jamanka.
In the women's event, Laura Nolte won the third Saisonsieg in the Two-- Bob on her home track.
After finishing fourth in the monobob on the previous day, she raced to the World Cup victory with anchorwoman Deborah Levi.
Double Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia and Germany's fastest sprinter Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen came in second.
She scored alongside her Olympic qualification the first podium in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig in third place.
For me, it was super cool to get his first podium in the World Cup, he was super happy that Mariama was with him.
He is super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start,, but the start times today were okay, said Burghardt and emphasized that " it is not only the start, but there is also a lot of work around it. "
Jamanka complained a little about the not entirely error--free rides, but said that they were going in the right direction.
He had the Decke in his Warenkorb and could now buy it.
I don't know what to do.
He has not received it and therefore has not been able to redeem it, which is why he finally asked about it.
Due to the corona, he had other problems last year and never had time for it.
And then he said he had run out, which made him very angry.
They were discussing the Asare Sitting Bank.
I want to return it and then buy it again, because it is reduced at the moment..
The reason for the launch of the delivery on the 16th of March.
There was no mention of such a long delivery time on their website.
There is no extra field with the Melding.
She was dismissed by her colleague the day before..
As a result of this, it is a problem today.
He also sent them pictures of the wrongly delivered Ware.
But they still want the Regal module, even though it is new and undamaged.
and not to cancel the entire order.
Only for one day, only for one week, only until XY.
Hello, the lovely beautiful women and girls and women.
He has a lot of things he wants to write about and he wants to write it in English or another language.
He is 24 years old, has KPTBS, is a full--time student and a dog mother - apart from the fact that her dog does not scream or goes to the kindergarten, he is essentially her child.
His friend ( since 6 years ) is ill and has suffered a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years ( but is now in therapy ) .
He visited him yesterday because he also has emotional needs and because he wants to see and feel him, they had a lot of cuddling and it was nice.
He helped him in the shower ( because his hand was in a bandage due to a burn )
He is also suffering from a cold, and they see each other only once or twice a week, which makes it difficult for him to fulfill his needs for affection and love.
My dog has a stomach ache, he has been fed and is now lying in his cushion and has relaxed a bit after being warmed with a heat lamp and stroked.
He lives alone with his sister and his mother, who is away for a month.
Now, they also have to do housework, which they divide up between them.
But even cooking for himself is a lot of work for him.
His PTBS illness is currently in a very good state, he has been halfway well treated and has come to terms with it.
Not good, but he gets through and is almost symptom free..
His university demands a lot ( for him ) now, he has to write a written test tomorrow at 15:00 and the next day he has an anatomy lesson for which he has not prepared anything.
And next week, he has an oral examination on the 12th, and what comes after that is in his calendar and not in his head, because there is no room for it in his head.
Also, his week goes like this: only until the next day, then it is the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on.
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until the end of the month..
And so it goes on forever.
I believe that he is just so stressed that he needs these mental anchors, because otherwise he can't do it.
In some way, he feels guilty and " chaotic " but in a different way he can' t do it.
It's also the case with them.
Honestly, he is endlessly grateful that he does not have to work.
Really unenduringly grateful, it is impossible to express in words.
He doesn't know whether he would have survived otherwise..
I believe that this also has a lot to do with the Mental Load of women and that is why she thought that she would find fellow sufferers there.
I wish them to have an enjoyable evening, the week is almost over.
Today, he received his order, unfortunately, the whole color is different, the surface is scratched and the table legs are imprinted.
In the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
They are very disappointed.
What they can offer to him.
When they now change the table, he will get another color or something like that..
The email for the cancellation was sent on the 26th of December..
In other words, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
This was completely different, in the school, it was established that many of the religion teachers did not believe in God and it was just another subject like mathematics or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps because he was brought up in a Christian way and he always believed in something.
As it stands.
Perhaps he can also talk to his colleagues from work or from studies with different perspectives.
Basically, he understands the difference between private and professional and it is beneficial to separate them.
There is also a learning plan.
But he also found it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes one want to teach religion when they do not believe in it..
Culture or something like that.
The hope is that the question is not too personal.
It can not be changed or not. He writes in English, which he also understands well.
This has been going on for a very long time, then he would abandon it.
It's good, thanks.
He expects a response within a few days, at the latest by the beginning of the next week.
Thanks to their support, #Name #.
Film search help.
Hello beloved people.
He is looking for a film from his childhood ( he is 24 ).
I believe it was a film for young people.
In the film, there are two time axes ( or parallel worlds ).
The Modern ( real world )
The other is the past ( or the realm of the dead ( not entirely certain ) .
Since it is not possible to describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the Land of the Dead, a young soldier ( uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the Fluch of the Caribbean.
For some reason, the paths cross and a story is created..
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Reich of the Dead who the woman wants to bring to the Reich of the Dead so that she can live.
The transition is probably also the grave of the soldier..
At the end, the two soldiers are fighting each other.
If he says something, he is grateful for every response.
From Week 1, Unsere Kleine has only slept on its belly.
He is still alive..
Relax.
A child can withstand much more than is expected.
Care to ensure that everything around is in order, no cuddly toys, more frequent inspections but no minute surveillance.
This makes him crazy.
Fresh air in the room.
A good mattress.
No cushions.
And so they had no sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Observe his child when it sleeps.
Turned the head to the side.
It can be raised from the waist upwards.
Or it lies with the face forward Directly in the mattress.
It can be inferred from this that everything is in order.
They are also all grown up and when my husband came into the world, it was also the case that the children were laid on the stomach to sleep.
In addition, they are already " Stammkunde " with them and have already bought many articles.
But they only offered him 20 euros.
Hello, he had written to a colleague of theirs the day before and had not received a response.
It's about his wardrobe closet, which arrived the day before ( serial number # Alphabetic number ).
The right shelf does not fit in the shelf.
He asked her to contact him as soon as possible.
The shelf is currently not to be used.
To make it clear to say.
RBTV has made a lot of promises.
And indeed, he himself knows that he cannot keep all of it.
And he had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply the case that the politics of this station is now under all sorts of scrutiny.
Every format is sponsored ( okay, but then they go on a begging tour at the same time. )
It was said that it was an " independent " television station.
Quoting Arno, he wanted to be " no more a running litfaßsäule. "

A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action, tries to make Asche.

Darmstadt after the first half of the season - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf.
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
For Ingolstadt, it is also not going well under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut of new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
The battery is broken.
On the evening of the previous day, his laptop ( a Thinkpad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old ) was no longer able to be powered by his power supply.
This has been replaced by a new one about five months ago, so it should still work.
He thought that the Netzteil alone would be enough to operate.
Failure, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start even with the plugged- in power supply.
Thereafter, he took the battery apart, but still nothing happened.
Maybe they have ideas.
A new battery has been ordered,, but it is not possible to use the laptop in networked operation.
There is something wrong with it.
Many thanks for their help.
He wants the delivery of the PRS Org until the room.
How to book it.
He is interested in the # PRS Organization 's chair..
He does not know how high the seat is.
Often on tour and still with a lot of equipment.
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem.
The 20- liter capacity can accommodate larger photography equipment without problems, which can be safely stowed in the padded FlexFold partition.
And the other things he needs for everyday use are also well organised and separated from the photo equipment in the individually configurable interior..
With the " Update " of the Everyday Line on the version 2 ( V2 ) the series is also presented in a new look.
The stylish and minimalistic design has it sprichwörtly in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed several highly innovative solutions that effectively protect the interior of the rucksack and yet allow quick access to the film equipment.
It works with two possibilities: by conventionally closing the lid, which can be closed with the Maglatch closure system, a very well thought out solution for effective protection, which has already proved effective in the Messenger Bags.
In the closure flap, there is a closure hook made of metal with an anchor bar on the front side of the rucksack.
Unlike most backpacks, the Peak Design has several " filling levels " - it has four anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be inserted.
When the rucksack is full, he takes the highest beam, when it is less full he takes a lower beam.
The Klappenverschluss and Haken are also magnetic.
This also allows the rucksack to be securely closed, without the hook being inserted.
The second possibility of the Everyday Backpack fundamentally distinguishes it from other rucksacks. In addition to the hinged lid, the rucksack has two recesses on both sides of the rucksack.
The elimination of the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from the top - it is no longer necessary to rummage through the contents.
At the same time, this clever detail enhances the everyday usability of the rucksacks enormously when he carries not only his photo equipment, but also everyday objects or travel gear.
In the Everyday Backpack, the interior can be individually configured (more about this below) and so both of them can be separated from each other without a problem, and can also be accessed from the two side openings.
This also allows him to pull the rucksack from the right side of his body, to reach the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain in the left half of the rucksack and do not interfere with each other.
Comfortable and easy to adjust carrying straps help.
And since the outside of the rucksack is made of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even when travelling to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, he waited in vain for the email from his support.
# Name # has sent him a letter of confirmation for the appointment.
The shipping company has announced that it will pick up the wrongly delivered tables.
Until now, he has not received any news.
He wants the matter to be settled immediately..
He has already written with the third support staff member, in none of them he went further than to the promise that he would receive a letter as confirmation.
It concerns the return of the wrongly delivered Custom # Name #.
It is impossible to predict when the cabinet will be delivered again.
It is not an option for him to stay..
It works.
Many, many thanks for the help.

and that the previous year did not go as planned, he did not foresee, and was not able to fulfill and clarify it in time.
However, the damage was inflicted on him as a customer and he does not accept this..

Coloma is the town in which an unanticipated event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered a glowing rock in the water on the southern bank of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and led to the so-called " California Gold Rush " of 1849.
Thousands came from near and far to make Coloma one of the fastest growing and prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were erected and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted to share in the wealth of the country.
For many it was " Coloma or Bankrupt "
In this game, he is a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the west and wants to make a name for himself.
He will be looking for gold, recruiting workers, breeding horses and establishing businesses.
He will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river flows and surrounding areas.
He is not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea.
He has to outperform his Pioneer colleagues in order to not go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
They vote simultaneously for their actions, have to manage their resources and build a tableau that works more and more for them ( so--called " engine building " ) .

Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 ( the year in which the gold in Coloma was discovered ) to 1850 ( the year in which California became an official state ).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After this, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
When a location has the most pioneers, it receives a Sperre.
This deactivated the one half of the area - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns to perform actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up camps, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions have been completed, the Pioneers return.
The Anpreiser moves to a new location at the beginning of each round, thereby changing the available actions.
This goes on until the Anpreiser has moved five times and has covered each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the player Coloma must defend against an attack by angry bandits.
When the players have enough Revolverhelden and the bandits are numerically superior, they receive rewards.

The player with the most points wins.

The " drive " of a tube endstufe is a major contributor to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sounds.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor Schaltung.
With the Volume, Gain and Master Volume Regulators, they can, on the one hand, achieve the desired volume and, on the other hand, the degree of distortion of their sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT + series have a unique power level regulator that allows the sound level to be reduced without altering the " gain " and the distortion.

It is time for change.
The German parliament welcomed him and he was greeted in the plenary chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day.
The purpose of the Post here.
When one looks at the activity of the German Bundestag in the past months, it can be seen that it is not existent.
They are in a winter slump and have extended the summer gap for several months.
The problem is where it lies.
The reason for this is that.
For the most part, this is due to the dissatisfaction, as many things have been dismantled and as a whole, they are in a state of dissatisfaction.
In the last few days, the impression has emerged that many people still have an interest in the MBundestag.
#The changes they have to make.
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is called upon to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u and edizvevo, who had become aware of the project in the last days and found a heap of rubble in front of it.
After some back and forth, a number of people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, he also wants to call on everyone to participate, only then the project can survive in the future.
They have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which they can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
The server can be entered through this link.
Goals
How the MBundestag will function in the future.
The existing orders must be changed, adapted or removed.
As to how they should appear in the future.
As new members are to be recruited.
To achieve a fair election system.
He is fairly certain that he has forgotten some things, which is not a problem,, but the end result is the Discord..
When they have the desire and the time, they come to the Discord and work with and decide the future democratically.
He has also ordered a lamp shade from them, which is still to be delivered..
Now, he sees that the article is too large and that it is not suitable for his taste.
For this reason, he has already ordered another hanging from them.

He is very sad about it.
He hopes that it will be returned and that he will receive a full refund.
This is also somewhat sad because the # Name # is much darker than expected.
He also has a question: the Tagesdecke # PRS Org, is also available in over- size, in 240 x 240, for example.
The PRS must ensure that the faulty shelf is removed as quickly as possible.
And he begged her to make it happen.
A suitable packaging was not available, he would dismantle the shelf as much as possible to facilitate the removal - this would then have to be discussed with the PRS. organization.
PRS can contact him by telephone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
There is an instruction for the installation.

As to the question of why they are vegan.
Today, he had a conversation with a colleague whom he likes.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while and eats very rarely meat now.
He himself was also a vegetarian for several years.
On being asked whether he had always wanted to be a vegan, and that vegetarianism had been a planned interim step,, he responded without hesitation.
and that he long thought that as a vegetarian he was supporting the welfare of animals, but eventually realized and understood that he was in fact supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, his decision to become vegan.
In that moment, she had the impression that Missmut had come to her side, and then defended vegetarianism, saying that she knew where her meat came from and that vegetarians reduce the suffering of animals.
Now, he is asking himself whether his response to " plump " was.
They responded to the question.
He has the feeling that as a vegan, he is quickly cornered and that conflicts arise, without him trying to provoke them.
It greets a harmonious vegan.

The question of right and left is always presented in a very simplistic way.
In general, it should be said that the Statesman comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary Left, which would have been obvious to everyone.
Naturally, also in the special uniform and weapon carriers, people right of the conservative and magical should also be aware of the fact that these people, then, naturally, with the lived reality have a hard time. Naturally,, it is also clear that these people, then, with the lived reality have a hard time. Naturally,, it is also clear that these people, then, with the lived reality have a hard time.

However, even these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, in other words, they are proud of Germany and feel that they have been neglected by overbearing left--wing politics, even though the latter is supposed to be in their favor, and they want to be treated in a normal way.
Back to the right, since the police and the armed forces are also a cross- section of society, there are also extreme right-wingers there,, but they are allowed to openly express their opinions there, or even openly plan to endanger the state, and this is overstated in the media and also irritates him.
Naturally, it is also the case that police officers and soldiers, who were often deployed in overseas missions, often began to stereotype and say things that are controversial and politically incorrect.
Also, there are also times when right--wing friends meet and engage in a vigorous exchange of ideas..
However, this is well countered and even with political education and enlightenment.
Germany is so heavily international entangled and this is also a good thing according to his opinion that it is not possible for them to have right--wing racists and Nazis in their ranks.
That which he does not understand, he has also ordered from the German side.

They do not have one yet, they are working on it and this question has been bothering him for a long time.
For him, he has no incentive, he is not bothered by it at all, as long as there are no visitors and there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
With a child, there is a greater incentive or there is a lack of motivation.
He is looking forward to their responses.

A career in social work, as a person with an unstable personality.
He has an education in the field of software development and has been out of work for about a year.
However, he has noticed that this profession is not the right one for him, which is why he has been thinking for a long time that he would start again and study social work.

He can become a social worker.
He does not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in, for example, the drug advice or the family aid.
However, he does not know whether the actual workday is actually as he imagines it to be,, and it is difficult to find anything about it on the Internet.

Originally, he studied something else and worked in a related field ( in order to remain anonymous, he does not reveal more details ).
The whole was then too boring for him, and he looked for alternatives that would be more fun for him.
At some point, he entered the ministry and was sure that this was the right path, even though the conditions were more rigid than in his previous profession, but he was not bothered by this.
He is now at the third " he googles other job positions " .
And it is only half a year old.
At the previous Malen, he always decided to continue and at least finish the Ref, after which he could still change his mind.
However, he is absolutely exhausted.
He had the last month so little free time that he was completely exhausted.
But there are still holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for him.
Before the Ref, he thought he was resistant to stress, but his weekend was also his weekend and his closing time was his closing time.
I had free time.
And the stress on the job was irrelevant at the time.
Now, he himself finds the family celebration to be too stressful.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy him.
In general, it is fun and from the outside, the Ref is going well, the feedback is good.
But he is completely exhausted and is wondering how much stress his body can withstand before it completely closes down - if it is not already doing so.
He wonders if he wants to spend the rest of his working life in this way - especially when he reads some of their contributions -, or whether he should return to the old area, where he was respected, was able to take time off when he needed it, and worked in a team, rather than as a lone fighter as he does most of the time now.
But then, he wondered whether he would be in the same place a year later and unhappy again.
They notice that it is all a mess, but they may have suggestions or ideas as to how she, as an outsider, can find a way out of this situation, in which she is completely exhausted and begins to cry at the smallest thought of it.
Decisions are now being made in an emotional way, this is likely to lead to nothing good.
However, their views may help to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel, or to be able to celebrate Christmas, which is enough for the time being..
Thanks for the reading and apologized for the wailing tone of his voice.
He hopes that his situation has become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of Vox has continued to evolve, leading to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the " Valve Reactor " scheduling, which perfectly imitates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20x, VT40x and VT100x Amps, they are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is on the cutting edge of technology in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology ( Virtual Element Technology , which is based on the analysis of the parts and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These Amps also contain the more staged Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analogue circuitry because this gives the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated arrangement, the VTX amplifiers have an enclosed box and a bass--reflex system, from which the natural resonances flow.
With the " Tone Room " software of Vox, they can recreate historical facts on the virtual level, even correcting and distorting the sound of the amplifier and the effects so that it sounds as they have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced Vox Valve Reactor technology.
It has been revised several times since then to accommodate new sound requirements, and in 2010, the Vox Valvetronix Series received a performance boost with the addition of more dynamics and a number of new and decisive amplification models.
The new VT + Valvetronix series was also designed in such a way that all guitarists on the hunt for a maximum variety of sounds would be able to find it.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamism of a tube amplifier, they expect a thick sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and an immediate response.
During an in-- depth analysis, the Vox engineers discovered that the endstages of the amplifiers had the characteristics of a tube amplifier and developed the Vox Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The 12AX7 Röhre bestuced Valve Reactor Schaltung of each VT + amplifier creates the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a Röhren amplifier perfectly.
NBA - Despite Wagner's 20 points, the Magic lost to the Clippers.
The defeat series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues..
The Wagner brothers can shine - but the victory against the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable - with three individually placed and foldable Velcro closure parts, it can be adapted to the needs of the photographer's equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras, ranging from spiegellose system cameras of all sizes up to full--format spiegelreflex cameras.
Ultimately, what fits in the rucksack depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a spotlight.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for additional lenses.
In addition, one can still stow a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera ( MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series ) can use the backpack for their equipment and for other things.
Equipped with the Everyday Backpack 20L, even drone pilots have made a good choice, because the rucksack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including the remote control and equipment.
A volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma. the longest in history.
In the three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
There is an end in sight.
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary island of La Palma since Sunday.
Previously, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 lasted for 84 days and was the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable records of previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past days, but vulcanologists were unable to predict when it would end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable " said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state television channel RTVE.
Damages in millions.
In the three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000 degrees Celsius hot lava has destroyed more than 2,900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
It is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 people had to be evacuated and the damage is estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Before the coast, erkalted lava formed two new islands with a total area of about 50 hectares.
The banana industry, which is crucial to the island's economy, was severely affected, with about half of the island's 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly living off it, which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were heavily damaged, the newspaper " El País " wrote.
Christmas and the gifts.
Christmas is on the doorstep and especially the children cannot wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension to have a seductive effect.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still unite the increasingly divided society.
It is especially important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a " peace--building contract between primitive societies " can be revived and re-filled with life in the context of this tradition.
As from Nikolaus, the Christkind became.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who associated the Christmas days with the giving of gifts.
Previously, gifts were given on St. Nicholas' Day.
The background of this still today popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving gifts, the German tradition of filling children's shoes with gifts emerged.
Protestants objected to this practice because they reject the idea of saints as intermediaries between God and man.
Because of these reasons, they oppose the institution.
Martin Luther made the Nikolaus into the Christkind and thus established a new tradition line.
The focus of the celebration shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since the majority of Protestants no longer see these details as so important, only a few are angered by the fact that the tradition of St. Nicholas, similar to that of St. Martin, with the singing of the St. Martin's song and the St. Martin's procession, is still an integral part of the pre--Christmas period.
Today, one finds in Stiefelfeld before the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to sought- after luxury watches..
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the Feast of the Giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, there is a chaotic mess over the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region as to whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who in essence is a kind of St. Nicholas, who over the years has acquired a number of peculiarities.
This includes, for example, his white Rauschebart, which is now only slightly similar to the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference of the chimneys to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure of the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy, the witch Hexe Befana is responsible for guiding the way to the infant Jesus.
In Scandinavia, at times, Fabelwesen bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought fame.
There are not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars,, the Christkind is responsible for the distribution of the gifts.

The man fled in a vehicle, which was later stopped by police.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene..
The police did not consider a terrorist background.
In the area around the Kensington Palace, there are several embassies.

In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies, that internally glow with color.
On the other hand, " Smart Stone " is completely harmless. The sun alone is responsible for the fascinating glow of this solar light, which alternates between white and colored light ( in six different color shades.
The unstructured and amorphous design is deliberately chosen - like a naturally shaped large stone, the modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic roundings fit in every natural environment - on the edge of the terrace, in the grass or in the stone garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger stones and boulders, where he is able to hold his ground thanks to his size.
Large preliminary work can be avoided, as the " Smart Stone " does not require a supply line or batteries as a solar lamp.
To place the " Leuchtstein " on a favourable, sun--lit place.
Two earth spikes are provided, which can be used in emergencies.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module conceals " Smart Stone " discreetly in its interior, together with his battery and two LEDs - one for white and the other for colored light.
The battery is already charged when sunlight falls on the housing.
As the sun begins to set, " Smart Stone " begins to glow on its own, with six attractive light colors to choose from, in addition to daylight white.
Also, the shutdown also happens automatically when the battery's energy reserves have fallen to a predetermined minimum or have been replenished.
As soon as the sun begins to shine again, the loading cycle begins the next day from the front.

Pill problem
Hello lovely women,
He hopes that he has done everything correctly,, after a year of reddit, this is his first post..
Due to the fact that she had to take the Pille again for about five years, mainly because she had severe pain during the Periode and bad PMS before the Periode.
Now, he would like to stay there again, because he has to take a lot of medication because of his chronic illnesses, which he cannot choose.
His main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but his skin.
During his last approximately two--year break from 0 to 100, he got explosive pimples all over his body..
As far as it is superficial, but it has affected him quite badly and he did not feel well.
In the two years of pause, the whole situation has not really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this happening again.
Without perfume and without fuss, his cosmetics are already, but he might be able to recommend something to him.
The female doctor has not taken her seriously and the hairdresser's appointment is still to come.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel through from start to finish.

Nutrition has also been tried in the course of the Christian illness with all possible foods, and he has remained on a sugar, milk and meat- deficient mixed diet because otherwise nothing worked properly.
It is also possible that Hormonell is the cause of the problem, but since he has so many construction sites, he would rather not look for anything else that is going wrong..
He had already received all of his colleagues' seminars and lectures.
Written and now he has lost the conversation and does not know what was said in response to his request.
He had to go to work in the middle of the day and to the telephone and suddenly everything was gone.
If the money was there, I would have seen it.
Check his bank data, perhaps there was something wrong.

The 110 kV earth cable is being rebuilt in 2022.
The approval for the relocation of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The decision of the Government of Lower Bavaria to approve the construction of the road frees the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
The railway operator Bayernwerk announced this now..
The 7 km long Erdkabel connects the Umspannwerk Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is close to the village of Edermanning near Reut and is attached to a mast of the freeline.

A beautiful start to the week.
They can forget that he had already explained it several times the day before.
It is a glass commode and the entire sides have been blown out, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken.
The commode stands in his apartment and # PRS- Org. refuses to come into the apartment because of the # PRS - Org. regulations.
This means that the Commode cannot be removed, because no one is allowed to enter the house.

Hello dear colleagues and colleagues.
He has been at the Ref since summer, he enjoys the teaching,, but he still has problems planning his geography lessons efficiently..
Unfortunately, his school is technically poorly equipped, so he can only use the blackboard, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In the school, he can also only copy in black and white, which is a problem for geography.
He needs a lot of time to plan his hours.
For example, they are currently working on the topic of geofactors, and at the moment, he is working on it alone.
In principle, the methods used are always the same, but at the same time, he does not want to spend too much time on simple lesson hours ( which he also needs for UBs and the like).
When planning, he usually starts from the learning goal ( what he wants to achieve ) and then thinks about how he can achieve it ( he usually writes down texts from books that his school does not have ) .
He has translated the book Terra and with the most of the tasks in the book he is not satisfied.
Daher also the work sheets.
Maybe he can teach me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would have been happy.
I would like to return the PRS Org number from the order number.
He has already decided on a new job at the PRS, but he would like to terminate his contract with the organization as soon as possible..
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or cured are allowed to enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and complains of loss of income.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations damage from the point of view of the Handelsverbandes Deutschland ( HDE ) the important Christmas trade.
In businesses dealing with non- daily necessities, losses in sales were to be expected, criticized by HDE's chief executive, Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey of the HDE among 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of the companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the high point of the year, is now often a hole without a bottom " said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre--crisis turnover in the previous week.
It only went well in the foodstuffs department and in the online area.
The Federation demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with masks, distance and hygiene concept was a safe affair, said the head of the company.
" 2G at the grocery store brings them no further in the fight against the pandemic. he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a high level of personnel.
The bandage regulation must be nationally approved, he demanded.
After that, every customer would only have to be checked once for 2G ( having been vaccinated or cured ) and would be allowed to enter all businesses with the band on that day.
In addition, stichprock surveys should be sufficient in the retail sector, as they were in the public transport sector with the 3G rule ( vaccinated, cured or tested ). .
Even the specialized on shopping centers real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The Frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre--corona levels, the turnover at about 90 percent.
These numbers are now in the middle of the so important Christmas business,, said chairman Wilhelm Wellner of the " Economic Week " .
Due to the high personnel and administrative burden, solutions were sought and approvals were granted.
This also includes the so-called Bändchen solution, in which " the visitor, for example, once at a central location in the center presents his 2G proof and then, equipped with an armband similar to those used in a club hotel, can freely enter all the shops. DPA.
He has recently ordered and received the PRS Org. .
The Spiegel has a scratch and the frame also has a flaw, which was attempted to be camouflaged with a yellow filler.

The Lampe is designed for Dual Balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp is controlled by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities.
In addition to the adjustment of the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and art light.
It is also possible to adjust the color temperature in the range of 3100 – 5650 K manually and to store it.
They use the current settings in the flash memory.
One of the special features of the Controllers is that they are easy and intuitive to use.
The Leuchte produces a very strong light flow with soft light of high quality, completely free of flickering.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which large areas can be illuminated at a relatively small distance is excellent.
In addition, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to use both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional available DMX512 controller allows for the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in inaccessible places.
On the back of the Leuchte is the control panel, it consists of switches and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness level in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
In addition, there is a slot for the NP-F batteries ( not included in the delivery ).
The viewer has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to achieve the placement of the individual Einstellings on the Speicherplatzes, it is necessary to press down the individual Speichertastes for a longer period of time.
The lamp controller records the current state of the lamp when it is shut down, so that, when it is shut down again, the known situation is restored - very practical in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to a specific color temperature.
Working with batteries is one of the major strengths of the DL3120. this is due to its ability to operate with suitable NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen ( and women ) - so they can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also be tested before the set, whether the batteries have sufficient power - it has a battery tester built in, for each of the two battery compartments there is a value in the two display annexes ( the upper annex of the left battery compartment and the lower annex of the right battery compartment.
In addition, it is possible to continuously supply power to the spotlight with the supplied power supply.
The construction of the projectors is very simple.
They have a 16 mm bolt as an attachment, which allows them to be directly attached to a photographer's tripod.
The inclination is by means of stabilizers on both sides to be reliably set.
It was also taken into consideration that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality, and as a result, they are designed for extreme durability and hard use.
In addition, a Neigegelenk is included in the delivery.
Grossartig is also the fact that the package also contains a bag.
This allows them to transport and store the light with all the accessories they want to buy, without problems.
It's a shame that it was given to him and it is too small.
"The party they wanted to throw " - Frankfurt celebrates a torrid comeback against Leverkusen.
It was a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in a row defeated Hessians appeared to be on the way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
However, the SGE then turned the tide and shot themselves within an hour and a half the frustration of a poor start to the season and won fiercely with 5-2. Coach Oliver Glasner jubilated at DAZn and gave a " universal praise " to every individual who was involved in the match.
At the start, it looked as if it would be another disappointment for the now ninth- placed Frankfurt team behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead against Leverkusen.
What then happened impressed the SG coach as well.
"As the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance, Glasner continued.
He is extremely happy with the performance and the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who returned to the field for the first time since the fourth matchday and overcame his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
The 27- year old believes that his team's mentality is enormous and was pleased with the result in particular for the spectators.
That was the party they wanted to throw.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also sees himself in a good position with regard to the personnel situation.
It is exceptional that all players are fit in December, that all players are in a top physical condition.
It is Top- Work in the medical department, but also the players live high professionally.
Now they want to " step by step " and " remain modest " and continue the tasks until the end of the year " at the same level.
The next match is scheduled for the next Wednesday as part of the English Week against Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30 on Sky).
Grade, he received the mail that his package was returned to him because of a mistake on his part.
He tried to call the PRS Organization, but it turned out to be unsuccessful..
It can be sent directly to him again or he has to wait until the money is returned and the order is resubmitted.
This would then mean that he would not be ordered again because it had already been delayed for a very long time..
They have already sat on the PRS' Organization 's chairs..
Damper for the women's handball team before the quarterfinal against Spain.
Germany's women's handball team walked off the court after the humiliating defeat against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes.
At the end of the main round of the World Championship, the DHB team suffered a heavy defeat against Spain with a score of 16-32 (8-13) before 800 spectators in Granollers and must now run against the host country in the quarterfinals.
They were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent, coach Henk Groener judged.
Against Spain, they must act differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8 - 2 points as second behind the Danes ( 10 – 0 ) .
It is sad that they did not take the flow with them.
The whole team played a bad game, they had to be eliminated. said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to qualify for the semifinals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on the following Tuesday in order to keep the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-- time Olympic champion Denmark was the wing player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"They were not there in the attack or in the defense, defender Xenia Smits admitted, and demanded that " they must now quickly look ahead ".
From front to back, not on the level.
Unlike in the previous five Turnierspieles, the German team was not at its best at the start of the game.
Misfires and technical errors in the attack and holes in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the job and prevented worse with several saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels completed a quick counterattack successfully.
However, the expected initial spark was not achieved.
Against the aggressive defence of the Danish women, the German women were hardly able to set themselves in scene - and when they did, they often failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was already lost after 20 minutes with a 3-10 deficit, and Mia Zschocke was sent to the bench for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, she can again participate.
Only in the final phase of the first half, the DHB team started to get into the game, and by the end of the first half they were only five goals behind.
The faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes when the score was 9-19.
The Groener Schützlings once again sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well--prepared opponent, who is one of the medal contenders in the final round.
As a result, the German team was not able to improve its performance and went as the clear loser from the court.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in the Christmas period.
In the context of the Reddit Advent calendar, they have won the Nikolaustag and use it as an occasion to dedicate themselves to family traditions in the pre--Christmas period, the Advent, Nikolaus, Christmas Eve and the Christmas festivities.

Send him something like a transaction number or something else that might help..
Over-writing confirmation. etc.
I would like to give him a gutschein code.

goes the same way with them.
The title says it before, he is an impf doctor in mobile impf teams, where ( until now only ) the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine is mainly used in care homes.
As these are now almost finished, he then goes to a part of the immunization centers for him..
He is willing to answer questions without a time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to him personally (e.g. " He takes medication X and it is compatible with the vaccination. "
In his area of responsibility, he is responsible for the propaganda for the vaccination, the indication ( the person has the right to be vaccinated according to the tuberculosis vaccination regulation and has no grounds against it ), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency treatment of allergic reactions ( which has never occurred ). .
The injection itself can be delegated to qualified personnel,, e.g. medical assistants.
In the impfeteams, however, they are often not present, but " only " ( by God's will ) pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of the infectious substance, but they are not allowed to perform the injections themselves, so that he also performs most of the injections himself.
Heavy " Huidlerer " problem, Amberger knows the solution.
A " Huidlerer " is a person who does not know what he is doing.
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger,, it has caused a lot of thought in the BR television show " We in Bavaria " .
However, unlike many previous days, the term remained unidentified by the callers on this occasion.
No, it was not a " nervous man ".
and also no one, " who has to go fast everywhere. "
The people heard that the TV presenter was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg was the one who revealed the solution and thus caused a lot of astonishment among the Oberpfalzers.
"The Huidlerer ", the audience was told, " is a Lapp, who wipes the chimney with it.
Dialectologist Antony Rowley, from the Bavarian Television since years as an expert interviewed, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Rhine dialect word, derived somehow from the more well--known dialect word " Houdern.
With the closure of a gap in education - perhaps also for many who have lived in the area around Amberg for a long time.
He has been unable to buy books for two weeks.
After the confirmation comes the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
He has the #PRS # Org # reorganized, with the PC connected, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing has helped.
Choice of wheels for the racing bicycle is really safe.
In the morning, he woke up full of energy because he wanted to train a little for his bicycle tour in the coming week.
Said, done and he went with his racing bike, which he had bought the day before on eBay.
The first 40 km were also very good,, but then the same thing happened in so many cities ( this time in Krefeld ) -
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud squeals and his rear wheels were not going to participate in the rest of the route.
Because of the Wochentags, he did not have a real possibility to get him a new jacket and a new raincoat, he had to turn back and take the first available train back home.
It was then also financially not so bad, perhaps it is even better when he repeats the change of the tyre before the Radtour..
Now, he stands before a question and hopes that they can help him.
Since he has a long journey ahead of him over several days, he would not want to face this problem again.
Now, it was not so bad, because the old tyres from the previous owner ( a very nice old man who came to pick up the bicycle on the day it was handed over and drove 140 km with them, which he described as suboptimal, because he had been riding on them for years on a roller.
But when he thinks that he will have to change a tyre after 80 to 90 km, he is really unhappy :D
Now, he was talking to an older man at the train station who asked him why he was not using the Marathon Plus tires, which are said to be unbreakable.
Now, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But they are not really unbreakable.
He has little interest in spending 40 euros to buy a pair of tyres,, only to be disappointed.
In addition to this,, he has 25 times 622 on the racing bike.
However, there is also ( apparently ) a wider version of the Marathon Plus Reifen,, but the majority is still narrower.
This is a problem.
or they would have advised them to use other types of wheels.
The Schwalbe side seems to favor the Durano DD more than any other.
Thanks in advance for the help and love.

After the release of their new High End broadbanders B 100- 6 OHm, it was only a matter of time before the Solo Series also received new members.
Sola 15 is called the new Sprössling and resembles visually the big predecessors with the B 200 – 6 OHm.
However, in this construction proposal, a specifically designed foot was included, to place the loudspeaker in the correct listening position.
This has no impact on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted in length to suit the circumstances at home.
The Solo 15 is well suited for people who are not very sensitive to loudness, but who want to achieve a very high level of sound quality..
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce such a large sound pressure level..
However, this does not mean that the Solo 15 sounds weak.
On the other hand, they grow up remarkably and for their size are extremely impressive and accurate..
Tonal was the Solo 15 tuned with a slight high tone rise.
This is a common practice among broadband users to increase the frequency at which the beam is focused..
Exactly on the pitch, the Solo 15 has a very clear and fine sound.
If the high tone area is reduced slightly, the sound image becomes warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the location of the individual components of a musical piece is pinpointed in the optimal stereo triangle with a sharp and bewildering precision.
The extremely low mechanical loss of the B 100 - 6 OHM reference causes it to have a sound similar to that of its counterpart.
The Solo 15 complements not only the Solo Series, enlarging it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of their Bausets, it is advisable to begin thinking about the final appearance of the speakers at the beginning of the construction, in order to make corresponding adjustments during the construction.
If, for example, the case is to be furnished, the lowering of the speakers has to be adjusted accordingly, as the furnishing still adds more material.
After all the plates had been cut,, a 8 mm hole was drilled in the floor at the corresponding place to allow the cable to pass through easily later.
With the help of an Oberfräse, the speaker opening in the front is now made, so that the B 100 – 6 OHm can later be placed bündig.
On the back, this opening should have been fitted with a 45° Fase to make the opening area of the speaker chassis in the interior as large as possible.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHm are interrupted in the phase, as in the picture " Detail of the phase " shown.
After this, the actual construction of the box begins and one of the two side walls is placed on a flat surface in front of him.
On these, the rear wall, the ceiling, the front and the floor are glued.
There should also be the use of the three reinforcements and glued together.
The reinforcements themselves can be made thicker or thinner depending on whether they are made from 16 mm MDF or ready--made beams from the hardware store.
In the next stage, the second side is attached.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot follow, the two sides and the front.
By means of a suitable Lochkreissäge or a Forstnerbohrers, the holes of the bassreflexrohres are made, as well as the connection with the back wall.
After that, a circular grinder is used to round all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the footplate can also be rounded.
In the aftermath, the footplate is firmly attached to the base of the case with cement and is additionally fastened with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the mounting points of the speaker chassis and the attachment clamp.
After the housing of wood dust was cleaned, the cable was laid.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm Bassreflex opening in the back wall.
The cable is then pushed through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, where it is left protruding for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, the cable is led to the speaker opening and left there loosely hanging.
Following this, the frequency changer is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the Frequenzweiche, as well as the corresponding attachment plan can be obtained from the construction plan of the Frequenzweiche Solo 15.
After the frequency changer is installed and the connection terminal is bolted, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
Through the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with some skill, it is possible to drop glue onto the opening and thus seal it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHm and with a small lamp, the sealing can be examined.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Then the B 100 – 6 OHm is connected and fixed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the positive cable ( marked cable ) of the loudspeakers ( larger contact ) must be angled.
At the end, the bassreflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm ( the total length of the tube ) and inserted.
To dampen, the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening of the bass reflex tunnel should be preserved.
He can also give an order now and start delivering in early June..
= Hallo to all.
Finally, they can announce that they will again organize the OSCAcast in this year.
Due to known reasons, it is not possible to have more than four people in the studio at the same time, which makes planning more difficult and the short notice of the announcement explains this.
There will be at least three people working on the switch, so that the Oscars 2021 will be broadcast with at least seven booms in the stream and hopefully thousands of viewers.
They do their best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it is still a pandemic and they are doing their best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
Around 0:30, it starts..
It's time to get the drinks cold, plan a good meal and make themselves ready for a long, but very interesting night.
