Germany - the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus is unavoidable.
The fourth vaccination is required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the opinion of the expert, the current vaccination in Germany is not final and continues with new strength.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of vaccine against the coronavirus are unlikely to be sufficient for full protection.
In this firmly convinced leader of the Association of general practitioners Ulrich Vaigelldt.
On the 11th of December, Die Welt reported on this.
The fourth vaccination is expected to be necessary in the summer, the latest in the autumn, according to the expert.
In addition to this, Vaigelldt expects that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus could be carried out " in conjunction with the flu vaccination.
This helps to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus " Omicron ".
In particular, the new variant is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with the " Omicron " strain is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of the preliminary research conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the producers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to deliver the vaccine adapted to the Omikron virus by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against the new variant of the coronavirus " Omicron ".
The research of BioNTech and Pfizer showed that the effectiveness of the two doses of the vaccine decreased by more than 25 times: "neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omikron strain - as indicated by BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases Bernd Salzberger advocates the reduction of the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, the accelerated vaccination process has an impact on the spread of both the delta and the omikron variants of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel is very convincing in this regard, - the expert emphasized.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet- A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm and 8.5 grams.
The Bet A Vib series is a special branch of the Bet A family from the company Pontoon 21.
She ( as well as the series Kalikana Vib ) differs from many other fishes in that she was originally created for underwater fishing, and not just for fishing in pairs.
These insects have a greater weight than their similar- sized cousins, which, undoubtedly, has a positive impact on the use of these interesting bait.
The other noticeable feature is the upper plastic plate, made of hard and resilient plastic, which creates additional vibrations during vertical and horizontal movements.
As a " winter worm " the Bet- A Vib demonstrates a very aggressive game when fishing.
Often, the most captivating animation is the simple, monotonous one, i.e. movement up and down almost without pauses.
Planning for a deviation from the vertical axis that is not very great, which is convenient for fishing in confined spaces, dense underwater vegetation, rocks and other obstacles.
In addition, there is a small deviation during the winter fishing of suits and large trout,, and especially in the middle of the winter, when precise and aggressive presentation of the bait is required.
Reaching the extreme points of its trajectory, Bet- A Vib immediately turns around and returns to its original vertical position.
Bait A Vib has been equally successful for winter trout fishing in stagnant waters..
In order to satisfy her whims, there are two modifications, with or without the noise capsule (NS - Nano Sound ) or without it ( SL – Silent ).
It is also noted that the Bet A Vib game is capable of attracting passive fish that do not react even to live bait.
Bait A Vib's casting distance and accuracy are demonstrated during fishing with the in--wake technique.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, well combines with fishing lines and twisted fishing lines even of large diameters.
For the catching of salmon, trout, suits, eels or pike, it is necessary to have a regular and " staircase " action, sometimes with " chirping " on the bottom.
When fishing in confined areas, it is possible to change the front tripod to a double tripod, which reduces the likelihood of capture.
Among its class, Bet A Vib is one of the most durable and, as a consequence, one of the most attractive.
With equal success, it can be used on relatively small areas as well as on relatively deep areas.
All models are equipped with hooks Owner ST-36.

The government of Dubai has completely rejected the use of paper in the production of documents - all state services also became only digital.
The government of Dubai announced that it was abandoning the production of paper documents and switching to digital technology.
All state services for the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the emirate's information agency WAM.
Tuesday marked the beginning of a new phase in the computerization of all aspects of Dubai's life - they have completed the transition to a completely paperless government, the heir to the emirate, chairman of the executive council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Makhtum said on Saturday.
From now on, the internal and external documentation circulation in all government institutions in Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The reform affected all sectors without exception: health care, public utilities, the police, municipal authorities and the courts, as well as many commercial structures. The government's initiative was also embraced by many of these.
The transition to an electronic government and the computerization of the document flow began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to authorities, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which amounted to 14 million hours of human labour and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Earlier mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobinin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Production and export of Turkish automobiles fell below the 2020 level.
Production and export of Turkish automobiles decreased sharply in November due to the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's results for the 11 months were worse than the previous year, according to Bloomberg,, citing figures from the Association of Turkish automobile producers.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were produced in Turkish factories, 20 percent less than the previous year.
The export of 759,000 machines was more than 25 percent lower than the previous year's record.
In the first 10 months of 2021, the automotive sector of Turkey demonstrated a positive dynamism compared to the previous year, but by the end of the 11th month of 2021, the production of automobiles was 0.3% lower than the previous year.
The reason for this decline was the rapid decline of the Turkish lira, which fell by 29 percent in relation to the dollar in November.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.

Pulmonologist Pulureasev suggested that people with weak immune systems are able to easily pass through the strain of " streptococcus ".
A doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be able to carry it more easily than those with strong defensive reactions in their bodies.
Pneumologist Sergey Purosev explained why the strain of the coronavirus " Ocmiorn " could be dangerous.
The cause of the infection lies in the conditions in which the virus is born.
The scientists believe that " okmiorn " originated in a tissue infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
In other words, the mutation did not meet any resistance from the immune system.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that the immune system did not respond,, he became very fast.
Apparently, there are more of these spike- proteins, spikes,, and their antibodies may have not been eliminated during the mutations - commented the pulmonologist Sergey Puřăsev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be able to carry the disease more easily than those with strong defensive reactions of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the organism to anything, to any infection - is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This is also the case with pneumococcal infections, when young people between 30 and 60 years of age die, and old people between 60 and 80 years of age die of pneumonia.
The immune response of young bears is completely inadequate - there,, where they could only threaten with their fingers, they bite as if from cannons on woodpeckers - concluded Sergey Puřăsev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia is either bacterial or viral.
In the first case, the disease is cured very successfully and quickly, in the second case, the symptoms can only be cured by the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia is the beginning of the toxification of the organism - this is the temperature, weakness and illness.
Afterwards, respiratory symptoms occur, such as difficulty breathing, hoarseness and coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, abdominal pain may also be indicative of a developing problem.
At the same time, in Russia until the end of the year, they may begin to vaccinate the growing population from 12 to 18 years old.
Virologist and head of the genetic engineering laboratory at the Romanian Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Pavel Volchens, noted that this category is very vulnerable to the disease.
In teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is maximized.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as children from orphanages - said Pavle Volchovsky, a virologist and director of the Genetic Engineering Laboratory at the Institute of Physics and Technology.

The immunologist proposed the hypothesis that people with obesity become victims of the disease.
The authors of the study examined the residual fat tissue from bariatric operations and found that adipocytes, the cells that make up the fat tissue, can become infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells located in the fat tissue, the macrophages, were also infected and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who died of the disease and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir to avoid the immune system's response.
Possibly, SARS- CoV 2 is also capable of this..
A biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences, Semeon Goloashekin named the causes of dementia and described methods of its prevention in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to the World Health Organization, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome is characterized by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, the person finds it difficult to orientate even in familiar surroundings.
Gološević noted that dementia is most often caused by neurodegenerative diseases, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
On a behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and the absence of active cognitive activity may play a role. - he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by bad habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, irregular sleep patterns and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the experts noted forgetfulness, the inability to concentrate and a decrease in abstract thinking.
Discussions are underway that loss of hearing may be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, or one of the factors contributing to its onset, the biologist added.
To prevent the occurrence of the disease, the World Health Organization recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical fitness, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Earlier professor of the neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics departments of the FGAAOU VO RNIMu University of Medicine and Biotechnology.
N.I. Pirogov, head of the department of cognitive disorders at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolewski explained the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30,000 artifacts illegally removed from the country.
In the last 10 years, the government of Cairo managed to return 30,000 artefacts illegally removed from the country.
He announced this on 11 December in the air of the television channel Al- Hayat, the chief inspector of the Department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Ghawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artefacts.
Only this year, in the Museum of the Bible in Washington, 5,300 artifacts from the ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered. - he said.
Abdel Gaouad clarified that all of the artefacts smuggled out of the country were recorded in the archives.
At present, staff from the department are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists " track auctions around the world and sales on the internet " through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The main inspector said that after the restoration of cultural artifacts, they are exhibited in museums.
According to his words, one of the returned artefacts was discovered in the ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
The auction house Christie's held an auction on July 4,, on which a bust more than 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million ( about 680 million roubles ).
This caused discontent in Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that artefacts were illegally removed from the Carnac temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of King Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the god of the sun Amen, was kept in a private collection and was not displayed on the market since 1985.
The manner in which the relic was brought to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively pursuing the repatriation of ancient artefacts illegally removed from the country over the last few years.
According to the authorities, 95% of the ancient artefacts smuggled out of the country are the result of archaeological excavations by " black diggers ".
"The Caucasian Tatars are not counted " - and this is correct, because the Caucasian Tatars (232,000) are an independent nation ( close to the Turks.
If they want to add, only 42,000 people - so many Tatars ( from Kazan ) live in Crimea ( according to the census ).
The Crimean Tatars are a distinct ethnic group and the name of the ethnic group consists of two words.
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT reports that Credit Suisse wants to gain access to the personal mobile devices of its employees.
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The reason for this is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue its staff with corporate uniforms, instead offering discounts on the purchase of mobile telephones or smartphones from a partner telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can monitor information on corporate computers, issued to its employees, because they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or clients.
Banks have the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if a staff member used it to meet with a client who was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees moved to a remote working regime, the bank wants to extend this rule to all facilities used for resolving work issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline until which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially in Credit Suisse information about the new requirement is not commented.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life (1925) was productive in terms of his creative work, but the most difficult for the poet and his " ego.
He is not a member of any literary organizations, he has distanced himself from imaginism, he is himself, but known, popular and sometimes severely criticized by critics, but the reading public is willing to accept him.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them were genuine masterpieces and the poem " Anna of the Snow " was completed and the book " Soviet Russia " was published.
The main success was in the end of June 25th year, when the state publishing house signed a contract with the Communist Party of Yugoslavia on the publication of his works in three volumes.
None of the modern Sergey Alexanderovic poets received this honor. he was the first.
At the same time, this was a very lucrative job, with a monthly salary of 1,000 rubles for 20 months ( the factory director received 300 rubles a month, the engineer 200 ).
Money was needed in that year as never before.
Eseinin married Tolstoy's granddaughter Sofya Tolstoy, he had to set up the family's household and maintain his sisters Kata and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life has improved, there is something to celebrate, but for him, everything is colored in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poems " Black Man " ( written in November 1925 and published after his death ) has materialized.

He is very and very ill.
I don't know where the pain came from.

Alcohol poisons the brain.
Many of his acquaintances noted that Eseinin was in poor health and appeared to be suffering from a serious illness.
More and more often, there are repetitions of breakdowns and nervous breakdowns.
and probably not only because of alcoholism.
On the other hand, such a diagnosis - alcoholism - has been attributed to Sergey Alexandrovich by some,, but there are no surviving documents.
The story relates to May 1923, when Eseinin, under pressure from his fourth wife, American Iseidore Duncan, recovered his health in a clinic in Paris under the auspices of Professor Petar Gannanovic ( he met Eseinin again two years later in Moscow).
However, the evidence of the poet's witnesses, scandals related to this topic are abundant in the memoirs - scattered across dozens of memoirs.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the horrific poem by the poet with the green snake rapidly developed.
At the end of 1923, Eseinin lived for a short time with painter Ivan Starcev.
Unbelievably, even though his income was very good, he never had his own house in Moscow or St. Petersburg. he lived in rented apartments, in guesthouses or with friends.
Starcec recounts.
He only stayed overnight, and in the majority of cases in a drunken and intoxicated state.
One day, returning home at four in the morning, Eseinin fell on the staircase landing.
Padaiya cut his face and coughed.
When he got back to himself, he started coughing, spraying blood all over the floor..
And even Eseinin himself, after his tour of Europe and the United States ( at that time, there was a dry law in the United States, but Duncan brought a considerable amount of alcohol with him ) admitted that.
"I saw nothing there but cabarets and streets.
At the end of the game, people stopped paying attention to him.
And he drank, of course.
He drank because he was bored.

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that Belarus uses migrants as " weapons "
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland Pavel Yablonisky expressed the opinion that President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as " weapons " against the European Union and intends to return to this " operation " in the following year.
In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, the deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a corresponding announcement.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily " stopped Lukašenko, but he " is actively searching for new paths.
Also, the Polish official is convinced that now the illegal migrants are using themselves as weapons in many parts of the world.
According to Kp.RU, the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced the readiness to expand the restrictive measures against the republics, " if the situation in the country does not improve ".
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously imposed sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by Sennik's hat: when a velvety jacket turns a man into an object of ridicule.
At the social events of 2021, the baroque jackets dominated.
Apparently, the first to announce his new fashion choice was Daniel Craig.
Even in September at the premiere of the film " No Time to Die " he appeared in a black and purple velvet jacket and a traditional " bonobo " dress.
After his example was repeated twice by Prince William, who first wore a green baroque jacket at the ceremony awarding the Earthshot Prize, and then chose a more classical version at a charity event in support of the Royal Variety.
In the past two weeks, the trend was tested on himself and Lionel Messi..
The football player came to collect the seventh " Golden Ball " in a Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
In addition, his sons were dressed in similar uniforms.
Ali Express has already noted the growing demand for baroque male jackets in Russia.
According to the analysts of the service, they were bought in 1.4 times more.
The most popular of the warm baroque jackets with a cushion and a tapered silhouette, the main colors are dark brown, burgundy, dark purple and, inevitably, black.
The average price of such models is between 3,000 and 6,000 rupees. Men prefer to buy exclusively jackets, baroque costumes they choose less often.
They can be bought not only by online retailers.
The budget versions are available in H&M, Mango and Next, as well as Zara.
In the segment of luxury jackets, baroque jackets are almost present in all brands - such as Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro and Saint Laurent.
The most desired is the Gucci model, in which actor Jared Leto appeared in one of the premiere films " House of Gucci " ambassador of the brand.
Choosing jackets from well--known manufacturers guarantees that they are made of silk.
Thanks to a special technique of interweaving the threads, a thick fabric with a fibrous outer surface and a smooth inner surface is produced.
More economical variants are made from cotton or polyamide,, but they are less durable.
The fashion expert of Lamoda, Ilya Vahoschkin, points out that in the case of the baroque jacket, the most important thing is not its model or fashion,, but its suitability.
"Baroque requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal for gatherings in the evening or at a festive event, - explains Vahokin. - It is also suitable for occasions when the invitation mentions a dress code of " black tie " or " creative black tie ".
The other important criterion, fulfillment of which permits the choice in favor of the baroque jacket is the status of its purchaser.
A man in a baroque jacket, first and foremost, needs to acquire a proper, advanced tuxedo with a surplus - according to the authors of the men's fashion blog Krasaavich Brammell. Men who wear baroque jackets, in general, belong to the category of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to participate in social events, which always have a dress code.
Ilya Vahoschkin proposes to combine the baroque jacket with the same manner of clothing, i.e. classical trousers with stripes, one--tone shirts, silk gloves with hairs and spurs.
Too ordinary and everyday things would look out of place.
The fashion experts from " Krasavica Brammelela " are convinced that the appearance of a sergeant wearing a baroque jacket is inappropriate,, but when it comes to " the leader of the group of those who organize this event,, " they say, " he is wearing such a thing in the theme.
If a lower--ranking person, and his goal is to climb up the ladder in a complicated hierarchy of the company or to get financial bonuses, he should not wear a velvet jacket.

The Pfizer vaccine was considered to be 32 times less effective against the omikron strain.
The effectiveness of the vaccine from the company Pfizer- Biontech against the Omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than the rest of the diseases.
The researchers said that they had found evidence of the presence of humans in China as early as 100,000 years ago, that is, 100,000 years before the arrival of the Homo sapiens in China.
The vaccine was considered to be less effective on the basis of research on the anti-viral activity of citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
The majority of people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars- CoV 2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omikron variant, professor Malik Peyris said.
On the other hand, the scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most effective way to protect against severe disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of a pandemic of the coronavirus with consideration of the influence of the omikron strain.
The authors of the study came to the conclusion that the omikron strain could cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and an increase in deaths if no additional measures were taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking the delivery of NATO weapons to Kiev.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Aleksei Rzesniks accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of Kyiv's lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Rzesnik said that in the previous month Germany blocked the acquisition of Ukraine's anti--sniper systems and machine guns for the destruction of unmanned aerial vehicles.
On the other hand, Berlin later softened its stance on rifles, recognizing them as non--lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to acquire this weapon through bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, it concerns the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
In the meantime, FT notes that the new German government, headed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz,'s position on the delivery of weapons to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrei Melnić expressed the opinion that Kiev does not need weapons from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of a military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite " Russian occupation " of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same " illogical " position, confident diplomat, Germany maintains and with the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky announced that Kiev expected assistance from Berlin in equipping its naval fleet.
In Ukraine, they expect Germany to be a partner in a technical sense, added the president.
It was also noted that in the spring of 2010, the party's co--presidents Robert Habek, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

The full scheme of protection from COVID-19 was revealed.
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection from coronavirus infection.
According to his words, this can be achieved through injections and the use of nasal vaccines.
When used internationally, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are formed. When vaccines are injected, this does not occur.
Immunglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, therefore the virus cannot penetrate the organism.
Inside, after vaccination, the largest amount of immunoglobulin G ( antibody ) is formed.
If both vaccines are introduced, a lot of immunoglobulins A and G are produced., but there is no solution for double vaccination.
The main advantage of nasal vaccination combined with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of the disease.
He added that this would help those who, in such a case, would be able to protect their bodies,, presumably, to the maximum.

The World Health Organization discovered " omikron " already in six decades of states.
The World Health Organization (WHO ) announced that the new strain of the coronavirus " Omicron " has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain may have catastrophic consequences.
The speed of the spread of the strain was reported in a statement by the World Health Organization.
According to the organization's figures, the strain has been detected in 63 countries and in all six regions of the World Health Organization.
This is despite the fact that it became widespread only at the end of November.
The WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization's experts are concerned that the new strain, as of preliminary reports, may surpass the degree of spread of the " delta " strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which currently dominates in all countries without exception.
Before the general director of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced that the omikron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the pandemic of the coronavirus.
Similar conclusions were also reached in Great Britain.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) consider that " Omicron " will replace " Delta " in the coming months.
The number of those affected only in Britain is estimated to be around 1 million, despite the fact that officially " Omicron " is present in the Kingdom with several hundred people and, according to estimates, up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the " Omicron " strain, with more than 2,000 people being admitted to hospital each day at its peak.
The British system of health care is not in a position to cope.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of vaccines from the company Pfizer- Biontech against the " Omicron " strain is 32 times lower than the other strains of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian " Sputnik V " reacts to " omikron " - this will become clear in the next few weeks.

The Russians warned of a new scheme of mischief makers.
Criminals began to look for new ways of mischief in video messages.
According to " Izvestia " with reference to experts,.
According to Ivideon's director of products, Seaur Aubutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communications is disinformation.
In this case, the mischief makers create a fake video based on real footage with the participation of victims.
Thanks to this, neural networks are able to accurately reproduce the behavior of certain individuals.
Abu Talimov added that using disguise, criminals may call familiar victims via video-conferences or create films with the participation of copies of human beings for distribution with the purpose of intimidation.
"Under such circumstances, it is easy to provoke brawls, because the malicious perpetrator can place people in improbable, dangerous or compromising scenarios.

There are five actions that help to avoid the disease of sugar diabetes.
Problems with blood sugar levels - one of the most widespread in the world.
However, some do not consider this to be of great importance, and in fact.
Sweet diabetes may eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Prophylactic measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water, which positively affects metabolism.
Sweet products increase the level of sugar in the blood to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the path to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
In order to reduce the risks of sugar diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Specialists advise to follow a low--carbohydrate diet.
A similar diet not only helps to reduce weight, but also protects against sudden changes in sugar levels.
For protection from the disease of diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of cellulose.

Dr. Pavlov spoke about the " migraine exit day " for truck drivers.
Several factors may contribute to the deterioration of one's well-being in the weekend.
The reason for the deterioration of one's wellbeing after working days is often " migraine on the day after work ", according to the words of a renowned endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences and senior scientific researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the University of Moscow and the scientific director of the Systemic Medicine Clinic Zhuhr Pavlov in his telegram channel.

The amount of hidden sugar in common products.
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
His excessive presence in the diet can lead to diabetes of the second type, as well as heart and circulatory and oncological diseases.
Consumers must take into account that under the name of an unknown ingredient in the composition of a product, hidden sugar, an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of caloric content, composition and glycemic index may be mentioned.
The label may contain up to 100 different names for sugar.
One of the most common and frequently encountered names - glucose and fructose.
Other sugars, such as dextrose ( obtained from corn ), levulose ( fruit sugar ) melaise ( blackstrap ) and others.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery items,, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausages, and so on.
According to the statement of the Russian Association of Sugar, the most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to eat whole and unprocessed products, and also to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar have different tastes, but they are all called the same ingredient in the composition of the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - but they still remain sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging,, but also the fact that fruits and vegetables initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Consequently, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.

At the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on 12 December ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced in the afternoon of 12 December, the majority of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted against independence during the referendum.
On the other hand, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51 percent (2,755 people) voted for independence from France, while 96.49 percent (75 762 ) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90 percent overall, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participating in the elections.
The results of these elections did not leave room for doubts, as the independence supporters called the voters not to participate in the voting.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on 12 December, considering that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago made it impossible to conduct a full and " honest " pre-- election campaign.
As a result, this non- participation opened the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 percent of the population voted against independence, in 2020, 53.3 percent.
The separatists said that they did not recognise the results of the referendum and disputed them in the UN.
As announced in the Elysian Palace on 12 December, the president of France, Emmanuel Macron would announce the results of the referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has been a major factor in the last few weeks of the French presidential campaign.
A number of candidates for the presidency expressed the opinion that the territory should remain part of France because it is " the last region of the European Union in the Pacific Ocean.
"New Caledonia must remain French " - Eric Zemmur reiterated.
A similar statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on Caledonians to remain French.
From his side, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position because it was not his responsibility.
Nevertheless, the president added: " France would have been less beautiful without New Caledonia.
Premier Minister Jean Castecs, on his side, expressed " a strong desire that the election of the Caledonians was an election of France ".

Uzbekistan begins to produce the new generation of reactive unmanned aerial vehicles.
The new Ukrainian- Turkish factory began to create the reactive unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV ) type Anka.
This was announced on 11 December by the head of the Ukrainian president's office, Alexei Arestis.
In other words, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other unmanned objects.
Even against piloted aircraft.
They will be equipped with Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics, the body and the like, - citing his dialogue with Ua.
Commenting on the main features of the Ankas and Arestochich, he said that they are reactive and not piston-- powered BPLA.
According to his words, this new generation of unmanned aircraft after the Bayraktar is superior to it in all aspects.
The first batch of BPLA is expected to be produced at the end of the following year, concluded Arestovich.
The AnkA aerial vehicle was created by the Turkish Aeronautical and Space Agency in February 2014.
The development of the unmanned aircraft was undertaken by the Turkish authorities in collaboration with a number of private companies from 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff's announcement of the use of Bayraktar and Javelin missiles in military operations in Donbass.
On 6 December, President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky announced that construction of a factory for the production of modern unmanned combat vehicles began in the country.

In the airport, two lions escaped from a container.
In the Changi airport in Singapore, lions escaped.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two hunters managed to escape from the container with seven lions arriving on one of the planes..
The publication notes that it is not known from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the fugitive lions lay down on the roof of the container..
The animals could not get away from him because of the protective fences that were set up around him.
The confrontation ended after the arrival of the staff of the Mandai Wildlife Group, who are in charge of all of Singapore's zoos.
They immobilized the lions using dart guns with tranquilizers and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that in Pnompenh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the wolf voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Specialists warned of the threat of cancer from vitamin B9.
Research indicates that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid,, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
In the opinion of specialists, there are significant evidence that people who do not suffer from a lack of folic acid are less likely to suffer from certain types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, excessive doses of radiation, on the other hand, encourage the growth of cancerous cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietologist Bett Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if it significantly deviates from this figure in a large or small way.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without the advice of a doctor, to observe the dosage and to avoid cereals with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Earlier consultant on nutrition Raychele Fain called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it is among other things contained in the avocado,, Fayne recommended men over 50 to eat this fruit more often.
In the United Kingdom, by April, due to the spread of the Omicron strain, about 75,000 people could die.
British scientists predict that, due to the spread of the omikron strain of the coronavirus, up to 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months, or even earlier.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian with reference to an investigation by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
According to the most optimistic prognosis of the experts who are part of the scientific advisory group of the British Cabinet Office, by April 2022, the country would have recorded at least 25,000 deaths from the Omicron strain and 175,000 hospitalized patients.
At the peak of the epidemic, the hospitals would receive 2,000 infected people each day.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be necessary to prevent overcrowding in the National Health Service if the omikron strain proves to be more infectious than the delta variant, and the existing vaccines are unable to prevent infection. " said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Earlier, the Agency for Health and Safety in the United Kingdom announced that, if the rate of spread of the Omicron strain remains at the current level, by the end of the year there would be 1 million cases of infection in the country.
At the same time, by the middle of December, the Omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom, 1,898 cases of the Omicron strain of the coronavirus have been identified, of which 633 were recorded in the last 24 hours.
On the other hand, on 9 December, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid indicated that the actual figure could be as high as 10,000 cases.
He wanted to write a witty comment,, but stopped at this point.

The number of supertankers increased in the world by a quarter.
Construction of superyachts in 2016 and orders for 2017 broke all world records, despite calls to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the fight against climate change.
In the world's register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units, a quarter more than in the previous year.
In the era of battles against the consequences of climate change, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people with the desire and money to build a floating fortress worth more than 50 million US dollars would decrease.
However, they become more and more numerous.
In this year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
The brokers say that such a frenzy on the market has not been seen for 20 years.
The first reason is that many of those who can afford to own a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on the deck of their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Previously, all these people worked in offices and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely and negotiations are conducted by telephone.
Shipbuilder William Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts in 2025 and later.
This means that the owners were willing to pay more, only if their yacht was ready two or three years earlier.
" People simply crave freedom, the super- rich can afford to do so., he says.
In western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, according to sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of lack of space travel to the stars, life on yachts or flights on their own aircrafts cause discontent in society because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists urge the government to act and propose introducing new taxes and rules for super--rich, although they acknowledge that it would be extremely difficult to implement this.
On the other hand, the impressive number of superyachts ordered, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 ships, 27 have a length of the stern above 100 meters.
The Norwegian billionaire Rokke is building the 183 metre long yacht Revenge Ocean.
After sinking into the water, it will be the largest ship in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a " lunar pool " and a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
On the existing superyachts, helicopter pads and open--air cinemas have been built, and on some of them, such as the yacht of boxer Macgregor, a wrestling ring has been built. Professor of economic anthropology at the American University of Indiana Richard Wilck says that compared to the number of carbon dioxide emitters, the carbon dioxide emitted by superyachts is insignificant.
However, it has symbolic significance, given that there are just over 2,000 multimillionaires in the world.
This is just another example of excessive consumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists discovered that the emission signature of billionaires is 10,000 times greater than the signature of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of carbon dioxide per year, Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission traces landed on his yacht Eclipse, 162.5 meters in length.
Even if the owners of the yachts are not on board, the crew continues to pollute the planet..
The owner can call the captain and give him the order to sail the yacht,, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Owners of superyachts do not elicit sympathy from other people when they, as the richest woman in Australia, Gina Reinhard, who owns coal mines on the continent, complains through YouTube that their giant ships do not have berths.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marines for ships with a length of 50 meters.
The dangerous weekly dose of alcohol that leads to the development of cancer of the stomach.
American scientists determined that the amount of alcoholic drinks consumed in a week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express..
Specialists came to the conclusion that the consumption of four or more portions of alcoholic drinks per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
On the other hand, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
In addition, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of contracting cancer of the kidney than women.
The exact cause of the development of this type of cancer has not been determined, with researchers noting that certain factors lead to a harmful process in the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two--year old child.
Many dog lovers believe that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they do not realize that quadruped mammals have evolved to a great extent.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to try to determine how intelligence develops in animals.
Although the vocabulary of dogs is not as extensive as that of humans, a new study has shown that dogs can react to 89 words or phrases.
The work of the scientists was published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or write poetry, they have no meaning in politics, economics and art, but they often outwit their owners.
Representatives of some breeds are considered by experts to have the best results in understanding human language,, but there are not enough statistical data to make precise conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered to be dog geniuses, such as Labrador retrievers.
Scientists came to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking and are able to learn as well as a two--year old child.

In Ukraine, preparations were made for the trade between the United States and Russia.
The United States and Russia would be " negotiating " over the issue of Ukraine's membership in NATO, said analyst Alexander Cocheotkov in his article for the publication " Glavred " .
According to his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations on the issue of guarantees regarding the fact that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to join wherever they want.
If they offer something that is obviously unacceptable,, for example, selling a close relative in a sexual slavery, they do not negotiate and simply send them away.
In relation to Ukraine, there is a trade agreement - the analyst wrote.
Kocetkov added that Russia does not intend to attack Ukraine, and aims for dialogue with Kyiv.
The preparations are carried out secretly, quickly and immediately move to the offensive, and not wait for the enemy to detect and deploy forces to oppose them. - he noted.
China is encouraging the development of railway transport.
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 International Railway and Production Equipment Exhibition held in the city of Chengdu in the province of Hunan in Central China.
The main technologies developed by the company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical defects, noted the company's representative Hou Chao-wen.
High--speed trains running on the railway line between China and Laos, which was inaugurated in the beginning of the month, are already equipped with these technologies, ensuring increased reliability and operability of the locomotives.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased exports of railway transport vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe have become witnesses of " Chinese speed.
In May of this year, the production line of the company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd produced the first two-- decked high speed electric train designed for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will run on railway tracks in Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the above- named company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the line of the metro connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement on this line of the metro will be opened in the following year.
This is the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
The Chinese industry for the production of equipment for railway transport is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international competitiveness, according to Feng Yao-sian, head of the trade and investment department of the Chinese Committee for the Promotion of International Trade.
"This sector constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high--class equipment on the world market,, said Feng Yao-shan.
After more than 60 years of intense work, after conducting a series of independent research and development, China created a sophisticated system of production of equipment for railway transport, with a full complement of auxiliary facilities and large-- scale production activities.
According to Feng Yao-sian, the country occupies first place in terms of the level of electrification of railway tracks and in terms of the number of kilometers traveled on high--speed and urban railway tracks.
The biologist identified early signs of dementia.
Candidate of Biological Sciences, Semeon Goloashekin in an interview with radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, symptoms of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a number of mild cognitive impairments, such as the inability to concentrate, plan, and a decrease in abstract thinking.
At present, there are discussions about the possibility that hearing loss may be an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, or one of the factors that contribute to its emergence, said the specialist.
Gološević emphasized that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, certain infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and arteriosclerosis of the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that, as of today, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prophylaxis early.
According to him, the risk of developing dementia can be reduced by studying foreign languages and actively interacting with others.
Also, the WHO recommends maintaining moderate levels of physical exertion and regularly training cognitive skills with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logical thinking.
There are recommendations for the use of various BAADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still debated in the scientific community, as said by Gološević.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical exertion, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logic thinking. - Gološević said.
Earlier, the charity organization for the investigation of dementia in Great Britain announced that the disease is increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Medics named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first noticeable symptom is problems with vision, due to which the patient begins to have difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another characteristic of the developing paralysis is aphasia, a condition in which a person is unable to find the correct words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment.
The former president of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili is in need of psychological and neurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, according to neurologist Otar Toidze, a member of the medical council of the ombudsman of Georgia.
His ( Saakashvili ) neurological status is leading in his illness.
Stability problems are problems with movement, coordination and variability, he said, noting that this does not exceed the norm and that the former president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
This is called neural rehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, which is not possible in Georgia, he said, and demanded that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began sabotaging the receipt of medical assistance after being disciplined by prison staff.
The Georgian politician was able to quickly overturn the punishment and restore himself to his previous privileges.

In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they described the " painful withdrawal " in relations between Russia and the United States.
Deputy head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sergey Riabkov in an interview with " Izvestia " assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long history of relations between the two countries led to the sad conclusion and that problems between the two countries began long ago.
One--sided negative predictability exists, but in some areas there is a perception that relations are improving, which is completely unpredictable.
This sad conclusion after a long journey with the current administration and with Trump and Obama.
The problems began not yesterday - the diplomat indicated.
According to Ryaabkov, the problems stem from the United States' desire to impose its approach on a number of issues.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he did not dare to give optimistic predictions about the prospects of improving relations and did not expect a change in the position of Washington.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cyber security, progress has not been made.

The virologist warned of the danger of vaccinating with nasal preparation from the flu in hospitals.
People who have been vaccinated with nasal vaccine for COVID-19 may suffer allergic reactions and need medical assistance, so the first points for administering this vaccine should not be located in airports and shopping centers.
This was announced by Tass biologist and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of biological nanotechnology, microbiology and virology at the New Siberian University, Sergey Netezov.
Organizing vaccination points for nasal vaccination in airports and shopping centers is easier, but it would have been done only in medical institutions at first.
The reason for this is that the possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable for a person to stay in the vicinity of a doctor's office after it.
Doctors have special sets of anti- allergic preparations, which act within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary - said Neetes.
According to the views of the virologist, the possibility of vaccinating in shopping centers can be considered when there is experience in using the vaccine.
He also emphasized that it is important that the nasal vaccine is deposited on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
On the other hand, there is a possibility that the vaccine does not reach its destination if the nasal mucus is sneezed after being injected.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were named for Zelensky.
The former deputy of the Supreme Court, Vadim Denisenko listed four possible developments for President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to his opinion, the head of state can remain without the support of the West and, possibly, make compromises on the Donbass.
On the 12th of December, Denisenko spoke about this in a publication on the portal "Glavred.
The first variant, called " ideal storm " by Denisenko, suggests that Ukraine would cease to support key Western countries, achieving an agreement about the future of the country without its participation.
This development of events would contribute to a deep crisis, with which Kyiv could face in 2023.
" At the same time, there is a decrease in the price of key goods, which are traditionally exported, and internal protests and opposition to the authority of key FPG groups. " added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all.
In the event of high turbulence in world politics, when the Ukrainian government is faced with a number of problems,, the prognosis comes to fruition.
Due to this situation, the leadership of Ukraine may compromise on the situation in Donbass, as a result of which a possible conflict within the country is possible.
At the end of the year, Zelenisky's position weakened and the likelihood of such a situation, according to the words of the former minister, was between 50 and 55 percent.
The third variant of the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition of those who are not in agreement with the Zelensky group and the president, as a result of which the possibility of seizing control over the military bloc and the implementation of " populist initiatives.
In the course of this variant of the crisis, Zelenysky began to " reorganize power " according to Denisenko.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the " father of the nation.
This may be caused by some event, which becomes a major disruption to society.

Estonian scientists are searching for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies is preparing three cosmic missions to Venus for the search of signs of life in the atmosphere, announced on Sunday by the " Actual Camera ".
The goal of the five- year missions is to assess the suitability of Venus's atmosphere for life and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartarian scientists proposed instruments for measuring acidity and oxygen content in Venus clouds.
Until now, it was believed that Venus's clouds were too acidic to sustain life, but it is likely that Venus was originally a terrestrial planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is expected to arrive.
It is assumed that if life is found there, the main question is whether it is similar to earthly or different.
If they are very similar, it would be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
However, if there is a difference, it may be more probable that life originated on Earth. - the leader of the Estonian team of the " Venus Life Finder " project, Mikhail Paijasal said.

The British economist was unable to predict the 2022 year.
The British economist Jim O'Neill was not able to predict the 2022 year because, according to his opinion, attempts to do so would result in failure.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert considers that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend could change.
The most important factor is the pandemic of the coronavirus, and on the second place is inflation,, according to him.
O'Nill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in the price of goods was temporary or permanent.
Before the pandemic, it was clear that " the world's endless abundance of central bank money had exhausted itself " and that it was time to return to a system where percentages based on inflation would correspond to anticipated rates of growth in GDP.
O'Nill noted that in the face of the pandemic, the continuation of the extreme economic policy may, according to the opinion of some experts, lead to a new upsurge in inflation.
In addition to this, attention should be paid to the issue of growth in productivity, as well as the increase in levels of poverty and the change in climate, concluded O'Nill.
Earlier, the head of the global research department of " Opening Investments " Michail Shuulgin announced that the positive expectations for the course of the dollar in 2022 remain and that the potential growth would be less significant.

The Russians gave the car dealers 4.5% of the country's GDP.
In the first 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2.784 million rupees on the purchase of new vehicles, an increase of 28 percent compared to the same period in 2010.
To understand the scale,, approximately the same amount (around 3 billion roubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the pandemic of the coronavirus.

The most profitable brand on the Russian market is the Korean brand Kia.

The Russian Lada is demonstrating a moderate increase in revenues ( plus 28 percent, Russians spent 229.4 million roubles on Lada cars in the first 10 months of the year.
On the level of the previous year, the financial capacity of the companies, the sales of machines in units in 2021 fell, in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and inovase in the minus - in the past 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion roubles on UAZ and inovase vehicles, 124 million roubles more than the previous year.

They regularly change the prices of their products and other manufacturers do the same.
The volume of the automotive market in Russia in terms of money is increasing and further, in addition to the shortage of machines, its contribution to this is inflation and also the desire of the car manufacturers to make up for previous losses, according to experts.
In the conditions of a shortage of cars, it is believed that many car manufacturers were able to partially compensate for the expenditures of previous periods, which they were unable to include in the price of the cars before.
said the analyst of " VTB Capital " Vladimir Bessapolov. -
It is believed that the financial situation of the automotive producers is very good at the moment, with high margins in sales.
The indirect indication of this is the increase in the price of new cars in 2021, which is observed by the expert, who notes that the price of new cars is growing faster than inflation.
In the long term, the market would grow and in terms of quantity and in terms of money, but mainly due to inflation and the increase in the complexity of the construction of the machines, Bessapolov predicts.
With the increase in supply, the possibility of raising the price is limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian film industry continued to grow in 2012, even though the cost of making films decreased, and film producers would still be able to make a profit on the basis of the number of films produced,, according to independent consultant to the film industry, Sergey Burgasliiev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, at present, automobile manufacturers are striving to obtain the highest profit from each sold automobile, as noted by Burgazliev.
Increases in the production of machines are not expected to take place in the next six months, and in Russia, this situation is aggravated by the lack of certainty among citizens about the future.
Against the background of the situation on the market, cars became a good object for investment, the one purchased a year ago, even with a mileage, can now be sold for more than its initial price, the expert concludes.
