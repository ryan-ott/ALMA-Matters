He is # PRS Organization 's big customer and therefore it is not a problem for him.
He only needs a number or an instruction to indicate what the package should be sealed with so that it can be tracked back to them..
A few days ago, he ordered the PRS Org for 249 euros.
Today it costs 179 euros.
I find this, honestly speaking, very annoying.
If he has to cancel the order and re-order for a better price or there is another way of compensation.
He also believes that children should not be asked to take on the role of a parent for their younger siblings.
However, he thinks that it is also good for the big siblings to take care of the little ones..
To look for a short time, to help for a short time, to bring the flask etc.
They learn responsibility, help in the family and are integrated.
As long as they are still young enough to be children,, he sees no problem.
When de's K1 is alone for a short time and it is OK for him, that is good.
He himself can best assess whether it is suitable for his children.
It is not the case that he would wrap the K2 and spend hours accompanying him while he sleeps.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is also due to the statement of the psychologist.
In the event of something actually happening, such as a fire, an invasion, an earthquake or an alien invasion, it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether or not this is a risk that he wants to take is up to his discretion.
Helping him to find the title of a book again.
He remembers having read a crime novel or a thriller a few years ago and he can still remember most of the plot, but he cannot remember the title.
The story was about fear and how to cure it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by dousing himself in food and entering the lions' enclosure.
The case is taken over by a Commissarin who, after a short investigation, is assigned to the therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with a fear of hospitals.
The Commissar has a small niece who also has a fear ( of fire ) and lands at this therapist's place.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist, a photographer who is commissioned anonymously to go to the site of the suicide and document and upload the photos to the internet.
It turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where the patients have a chip implanted in their brain that suppresses an anxiety center, and the patients end up expressing their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window and another rushes to her death )
This fight against fear is described in the book as " the fight " .
At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital with a fire to do with.
This is the basic plot of the original book, which was written by a French author or authoress.
If this action is known to someone or even if the title of the book is revealed, he would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the password for the WLAN.
He must first contact his husband.
However, it can take a long time.
What steps he has to take afterwards.
It is also possible for the price difference to be reimbursed.

Because of Omicron, Johnson wants to push ahead with the Auffrischimpfing.
There are always new cases of the Omikron strain in the United Kingdom.
Until New Year's Eve, all adults in England were to receive an offer to be vaccinated.
London - the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to be ahead of the rapid increase in the number of cases of the Omikron strain in the vaccination against the coronavirus than originally planned.
Every adult in England would be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, if three months had passed since the second vaccination,, Mr. Johnson said in a pre--recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
Previously, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government would also provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
He is facing the threat of the Omikron variant, which means that the vaccine protection must be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news was that the protection level with a third dose of the vaccine would be increased again.
"Now it's up to the boosters ", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more cases of the Omikron strain were recorded in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, there was an increase of 65 percent. DPA.

He is in favor of everyone using pronouns.
He has sent in an application.
Today, the invitation to a meeting was delivered by mail.
He wants to respond to the email..
However, the name is not Peter, but a somewhat more complicated name.
He has been Googled and depending on his or her cultural background, he or she is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how he should write the email now.
I would like someone to help him.
He is an immigrant and does not want to have a police officer on his feet.
The conclusion is that everyone should be aware of pronouns.
He has a total of 5 books.
4 of them go.
Only the one that he bought today does not work.
Obviously, there was a shortage of seats at the time of the sale.
It is hard to understand how such a polstering damage can occur after 9 months..
It was first tried on the PRS Organization..
However, it has been functioning since around 2000.
14 days from now.
Therefore, he has always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the PRS Organization.
He bought 6 PRS orgs and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and he wants them to be made available again and for them to be paid for.
[CW ) The feeling when he can't help.
The content of the article is about domestic violence.
I have to write something from the heart.
He (21) is often in contact with the victims and perpetrators of domestic violence due to his job.
One of the themes that really bothered him and that happens too often is that many victims do not help themselves or think that they cannot help them.
It is clear to him that they are not able to do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in his profession that move him more than when he cannot do anything in such situations.
He sees the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes.
Even in a four--way conversation with the perpetrator, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing range, he cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of the children from this leaving it.
What he always wants to make clear is that he is very close to tears, and that it is possible to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they are not obliged to accept violence..
He often wishes that he could be there to help,, but knows that he cannot..
It becomes easier as a result,, but never easier.
Beneath, he always thinks of the fact that it is worth living without violence, that is so unthinkably important..

Basketball Bundesliga - Derby debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim.
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
For the second time within less than three months, the Giants lost to Crailsheim - and how.
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick commented on the cup defeat against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October by saying " they still have a bit of resentment.
After the game,, however, he did not lay down - but instead increased his performance after the 61-72 (28-38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
However, more than the naked result, it was the manner of the performance that disappointed.
Represented by a statistic, the entire Dilemma is expressed. The three- quota was only 13 percent, 4 goals ( all of them from the young Johannes Patrick ) from a total of 31 attempts - questions remain.
The response from John Patrick was " After the victory in Teneriffa, they were not concentrated enough and did not implement what they had trained. "
To move the ball.
Ganz different reacted his counterpart Sebastian Gleim: " A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time. said the happy coach.
"It has felt like being in front of 10,000 people.
There were only 750 spectators allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but the spectators came at their own expense.
In addition, due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
"The best player he ever coached " praised Gleim.
Whilst in Patrick's team, the main performers, Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh ( 7 points ) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22 - 15) the Giants prevented a total disaster and came up to eight points behind, after they had already been 39 – 59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
However, a lot of time is left to argue.
The Giants received the Skyliners from Frankfurt on Wednesday (19:00) before a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
They used to have another mailadress, but they have changed it.
He has already been registered for several months..
Unfortunately, all claims for compensation were rejected.

Stets like the egg is peeled, Max Raabe is 59.
He is able to charm his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s.
At present, he is on tour with the programme " Good Day, Loves Gluck " - if he is allowed to perform.
Originally, Max Raabe was going to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig on this Sunday.
However, nothing comes from it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 at the request of the authorities to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
As well, other of the singer's planned appearances in the Advents period have to be postponed,, as it is stated on the singer's website, which is now 59 years old, and his musicians ( Palast orchestra ) .
In January 2020, the artists planned to make up for the cancelled concerts of 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, Germany, Max Raabe has already sung a lot as a youth.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone with his repertoire of songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists has established himself.
He was awarded many prizes.

Federal Minister of the Interior Klara Geywitz: Through confiscation, no new housing is created.
The new Federal Minister of Housing, Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing conglomerates as demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
" With an expropriation, no new housing is created, only the ownership structure changes. " Geywitz said in an interview with the " Tagesspiegel " ( Sunday ) .
His goal is to give tenants the security that their rent would remain affordable in the next years.
A bizarre mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Green Party and the Left Party will set up an expert commission to deal with the results of the people's vote.
However, when the situation did not improve, Geywitz was still in talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement stipulates a miet price ceiling until 2029, a limitation of renter increases in overcrowded housing markets and the expansion of the miet spigel.
He would meet with the Justice Minister to implement it as quickly as possible.
When the rental market does not calm down,, the SPD politician said that she and her coalition partners would discuss further steps.

Many thanks for the quick clarification.
When the lamp is sent in March, how long it takes to send it itself.
He has already cut himself on the finger.
This is an absolute disrespect.
At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky.
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes swept across the United States.
Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths could be claimed.
The pictures from there resemble a war zone.
In the night of Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe damage and possibly hundreds of deaths in the United States.
The storms have left an approximately 320 km long swath of devastation, particularly in the state of Kentucky.
Dessen Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere where the tornado passed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops and government buildings are to be demolished.
Parts of industrial buildings and roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that it is possible.
He estimates that there are up to 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, the official numbers rise daily.
Hello, he has just seen that the Vitrine # Name # has been sold out.
It is very sad.

He had sent an article through the contact form and wanted to find out whether it had been returned or processed, as he had not received any confirmation.
Companies pay bonuses for vaccinations and change their advertising slogans.
Whilst the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for an immunization premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for the immunization.
They are on the same line as the Social Partners OGB and the Economic Chamber, who today demanded financial incentives for a vaccination.
Also, the transformation of advertising slogans into appeals for Corona vaccinations, after the German example, is intended to increase the willingness to take part in Corona vaccinations.
He has been transferred to a different company where he has been gossiping.
This does not make his situation any better than his.
Waiting and tea drinking.
It has been a year.
He has not yet settled in his old place and has been looking for a new one..
He can also do it..
and that he did not like him at that time.
He also did not like his job.
There are too many variables.

He makes a screenshot.
A good day - he is interested in the Boone table, white.
There is also a 230 cm version of this..
In their Onlineshop, kitchenpoint, they sell all the Smeg kitchen equipment and the corresponding accessories.
They scrutinize the quality and completeness of their orders.
The new coffee vending machine from Smeg brings freshly ground coffee into the kitchen or the office.
The simple and reduced design, the plastic surface in matte colors in combination with the matte-brushed stainless steel front make the new Smeag coffee vending machine with milk dispenser a design object.
The reduced design allowed all the functions, such as the choice of grind and amount of water, as well as the choice between an espresso, an Americano, a Ristretto and a mild coffee, to be controlled by four knobs.
Thanks to the Dampflanze, it is also possible to produce coffee milk and milk foam specialities..
Help with the first own campaign.
Boron to greet.
He is currently leading a group of four friends through the Abenteuer Over the Greifenpass and wants his heroes to seamlessly move into an independently written campaign.
They play DSA 5.
The great arc has been made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been planned and now he is busy writing the opening adventure and has already stumbled over his own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes must transport a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
There, the further development of the story is supposed to take place.
A few miles from the village, the hero encounters a group of goblins, they lure him into a trap.
He wants to give the player characters the possibility to solve the confrontation in different ways: to persuade, to act, to threaten, and to recognize the danger early on, which also always occurs to the players.
8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears and 6 armed with bows and swords.
The Goblins hide in the Nichtbemerken and ambush the hero in a hollow way, flanking him to the left and right with bows, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, he has two solutions.
The heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a halfelf.
The carriage is, of course, gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this halfelf takes two of his knights and comes to the hero's aid in battle.
The carriage is still there, everything is going well.
Deus ex Machina from Lösion 2 does not work.
The Encounter as an introduction to the adventure is too much.
The Group of Goblins later plays a decisive role and is not only cannon fodder.
Edit, I was not expecting so many responses, in particular not with so many good suggestions and tips.
He will be guaranteed to accept many of their ideas and now has more confidence in his narrative.
He took the lamp apart again.
and again together welded.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, he would like to send her back.
They can then be allowed to leave the back of the plane, then the lamp can be packed up and brought to the PRS organisation..
Transport costs and time savings, at the same time reducing the burden on the environment.
If he needs more than one item, he must first click on " now pay " when all the items in the warehouse are available.
Thus, automatically the Kombiversand is calculated and he gets everything in a package.
Through this action, he saves himself from the multiple purchase and payment, and the environment is happy because no unnecessary transport material and unnecessary fuel is used for the delivery of multiple packages.
Faster delivery with DHL, DPD and the German Post.
Normally, Deine Sendings are delivered to their destinations within 24 hours of receipt of payment.
In order to ensure that his package arrives at him as quickly as possible, he must also pay attention to the fact that his address is complete and that his name is on his mailbox and his bell.
He would like to send his package to a packing station.
Then he chose DHL, because only DHL is allowed to deliver at DHL packing stations.
They sent him an email with the flight number if he had chosen DHL or DPD as the carrier.
Therefore, it is possible to see where the package is located as early as 22:00.
His satisfaction is their goal - all five stars count.
If he is satisfied with them, they would be happy if he gave them a positive assessment and awarded all five stars.
If it happens that not everything has been carried out to his full satisfaction, he would be grateful if he reported to them before giving a rating.
Only then they have the chance to do everything they can to make him happy..
They have nothing to do with the chair.
and then the Rift was there.
He was simply sitting there.
The lower part was damaged, thus the part with storage space was damaged.
Then everything is taken away or only the storage part.
I'm fed up with Sky Sport F1.
Hello to the fans of Formula 1, over the course of the season, the quality of the broadcasts on German Sky has decreased,, so that he wanted to make a little noise with this post.
For the first time today, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 coverage to begin on time.
However, due to the delayed start and the start accident, the time plan was far behind the planning, but the last ( planned ) ten minutes as well as the championship decision could still be shown.
Apparently, from a legal point of view, the F1 has priority, and as a result, all other broadcasts must be restricted,, so that Sky DE had no choice in the matter.
Despite the fact that Sky UK did not broadcast the end of the race.
Despite this, a small compliment to the commentator Olivier Zwartyes, he has followed the difficult situation around the heavy accident well.
Then, the F1 had another rule infringement by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, who did not know that under a red flag, the wheels can be changed.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone in 2015, it was not until after the exchange of messages between Hamilton and Verstappen on the subject of changing the tires that the two came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change the tires.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately realized that Verstappen had this possibility.
He is of the opinion that such basic rules should be known when commenting on Formula 1 on a pay- television channel..
It is also not the first time that Rätselraten has been at odds with the regulations. both have had constant uncertainty in the matter of the regulations.
In general, Roos' use of the artificial commentary style does not appeal to him, but that it is a matter of taste.
But even Heiko Water from RTL is better.
This is accompanied by constant silliness, both of which are unprofessional and make the reporter, Peter Hardenacke, and Ralf Schumacher's "UuuuuHD " look amateur.
In particular, the latter brings total chaos to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
In addition, the advertising takes over completely at Sky, in the final round, Sky is the only channel that advertises during the race, as F1 TV can only broadcast the race without commentary directly after the race.
Neither Servus TV or ORF do this.
Both of these channels also have less advertising in their training sessions than Sky, and as a free-to air channel.
However, Glock and Baumgartner must be praised for their work, but this alone does not allow one to overlook the shortcomings.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programme is also very thin and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is the worst German--speaking channel to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast until the end of the season..
In other words, the grandiose F1 season was made much less enjoyable than it would have been with a decent broadcaster.
Mich would like to know their opinion.
On the one hand, the pendulum light, bronze and multi-colored glass x 1.
Hello, he has an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and has not been delivered yet.
He has contacted the chat twice and nothing has come of it..
The First Lady told him that it would be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told him that she would review and send it, but she never responded.
Hello, on 12 December 2019, he ordered two PRS orgs.
One of them has already shown a defect ( the material has a hole on the front part of the stool )
He is asking for help.
Lifter pumps are well suited to supplying oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system over the air heater.
This series is offered in 3 variants by them.
At the end of the offer, they look at the table.
Here, they can see the differences between the two.
If the pumps are strong enough, it is possible to run entire factories with them.
Owners of large aquariums tend to use pumps with 2 or more outflows, so that they can attach multiple outflows.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model, but louvre pumps are also suitable,, e.g. to set an accent in an aquarium with an air curtain ( available in the shop ) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
There would have been a treasure chest, a shell or something similar.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction, which results in low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by a 4 to 6 mm air hose to an Auströmer o.a. and can start.
The ventilator pump should be the same or higher than the water level and placed outside.
The water pump sits lower than the water level, therefore a backflow valve must be placed in between.
The air tube was simply cut through and the ventilator was placed in between.
This would be prevented if the water would flow backward, and the water from the basin would flow through the pump.
If the ventilator pump is placed in the open,, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though they in eBay say that the processing time is 3 days, they are packed every day and the packages are picked up every day.
On the road, everything is going well, it goes very fast.
They want to only slightly prevent, so that no one is upset, only because it lasted a little longer than expected.
It would be so that not everyone has understanding for the whole employees who also work in the freight transportation industry., there is no break in the freight transportation industry.
They should not be judged as badly just because the delivery has been delayed, which is solely the responsibility of the courier companies.
The Dienes are often criticized, even when they say that they have it very difficult at the moment.
This is also regional very different.
They are not to be blamed, they are to remain healthy and they all hope for better times to come.
how long it takes for the yellow to be ordered with and without armrests.
It was also possible to buy the legs in white in this place..
The founder of Amazon, Bezo sends his astronaut daughter and TV host into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers had a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday from the rocket system " New Shepard " of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the roughly ten- minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a blazingly blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly knighted astronauts upon their return.
" Welcome back, he said in a blue space suit, as he opened the capsule door.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers stepped out one after the other and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds in the air and reached a height of 10,700 meters.
The 74 year old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998, after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50 year old TV host Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets. Aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they each paid for their tickets was not revealed by Blue Origin.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminisced after the short flight about the mission of her father.
He had to work hard during his assignments and had to do everything himself.
She was just so amused, said the 74-year old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
He would like to go back to space as soon as possible, said the moderator.
" New Shepard " flies up to 100 kilometers.
The rocket system " New Shepard " flies mostly autonomously.
During the flight of the rocket, the capsule separated and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times experiencing weightlessness, before it was gently landed by large parachutes.
The International Air Traffic Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was the third manned flight of Blue Origin, the first was in July, when Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82 year old former US pilot and an 18 year old Dutchman.
At the second one in October, the 90- year old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became famous for his role as " Captain Kirk " in " Star Trek " was there, as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing the business of space tourism without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Perfectly, it is true, he needs nothing else.
They only need the tracking number on his mail.
A person who works or studies in the field of biochemistry.
He is currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and finds the subject itself quite interesting and is not bothered by the laboratory ( having already completed the inorganic chemistry practicum.
He had already been informed about his career prospects prior to the start of his studies, but he also thought at the time that he would continue to study until he received his doctorate.
At the moment, he has doubts, especially about his career prospects.
On the one side ( Studycheck etc ) one hears constantly super career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other side one hears constantly of unemployed biologists and poorly paid jobs.
I would really like to be interested in it.

Extra stress before holidays and holiday weekends.
This topic came up last week with him.
But he had to use his long weekend to relax..
Therefore, only now a post was erected.
Not only during the big holidays,, such as the Christmas holidays,, there is great stress in the company.
It seems that there are also before holidays and bridging days.
It was, in fact, so - Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which in Switzerland is known as " Auffahrt " .
On Friday, the majority of people and businesses take a bridge day, which is therefore semi- official.
There was a long 4- day weekend in the house last week.
In the last week,.
Everywhere there is stress.
Lots of urgent emails that had to be dealt with before the long weekend,, all of them " urgently " before the long weekend.
Because of the fact that it's because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because of the fact that it is because
Because " the next week then " after so much time sounds and it is not allowed.
or because the people all seriously in a shortened week want to achieve as much as in a normal one.
Not only he was stressed on Wednesday, he was also very aggravated.
This self--imprisonment because of holidays.
They have then still the Feast days,, but they cannot celebrate them properly.
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent of each other.
My question is simply that only the Swiss are like this..
This is the reformed evangelical way.
or they know it in the north as well.

Nekton Bio facilitates a smooth molt and the formation of new feathers.
Nekton Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals and 200,000 micrograms of biotin per kilogram.
Nekton Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of the wing injuries occurring in the care of birds are caused by feeding errors.
As the feather is made of protein, a particularly rich and balanced protein feeding of the birds is necessary for the formation of a perfect feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the moult are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate provision of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of Nekton Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant--based feed is specifically considered and balanced.
During the use of Nekton B, no other vitamin supplements should be given.
Nekton Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be fed through the drinking water or the soft food.
Many thanks, he has found it.
It still doesn't work.
The DDR Handcrafted model of the Altbau E 95 steam locomoter of the German Reichsbahn, the locomoter was in use in Silesia and Mitteldeutschland, the very rare locomoter comes from the 1968 modification proposal of the Model Train Maker's magazine Heft 11, used with play marks and defects, the E 95 series is a heavy freight train steam locomoter of the German Reichsbahn, which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network. It is possible that the locomoter's bauset also came from the small series firm Zschutschke and Bachmann.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle ( Saale ) and is operational.
The German Reichsbahn Society had the AEG commissioned in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200 tons of coal and 530 tons of passenger trains with a speed of 45 km/ h.
The maximum speed was 65 km / h.
The DRG decided in March 1926 that the locomotive would be delivered as a 1 "Co + Co 1 " locomotive with Tatzlager drive from the AEG with the mechanical parts and the Siemens- Schuckertwerke with the electrical parts.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, with the operational numbers E 95 01 – 06.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves again in the territory of the later DDR..
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
In the Reich Railroad Improvement Works in Dessau, all six locomotives were found to be suitable for rebuilding.
With the increasing electrification of the middle German network, a growing need for locomotives for the heavy goods train service emerged, and in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01, E 95 02 and E 95 03 were rebuilt, with the other locomotives serving as replacement parts.
The E 04s, E 44s and E 94s that were available in larger numbers were given priority.
Only after the E 94 was decommissioned, the E 95 became the focus of the decommissioning.
At first, the locomotives were stationed at the Bahnbetriebswerk Leipzig- Wahren.
They came to the Bahnbetriebswerk Halle P in 1960.
They were used in their own circular flight plan mostly for coal deliveries from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic.
It was often the case that Schütze was left behind when it came to decisions..
Then,, the on this locomotive constantly travelling Beimann with a hammer and an axe had to dismantle the gun during the journey.
Damage to the Fahrmotors occurred more often and led to month-long outages of the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new locomotives were available and a significant expansion of the electrified network was not planned at the time, so the Reichsbahn could dispose of the E 95s and the majority of the splitter types.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn's electrical locomotives only wanted to be manned by one person, due to the difficulties with the machinery and the visibility from the driver's cabin, which would have led to problems in the operation of the trains.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid 1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which withdrew from service on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was used as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a track heating plant at the Hauptbahnhof Halle.
It took a long time for the Reichsbahn authorities to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initially external restoration of the locomotive began with the goal of being able to present it in the RAW Dessau as a showpiece.
From 1959, she belonged to the Museum of Transport in Dresden as a non- operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
In the DB Museum Halle ( Saale ) the museum locomotive is cared for.
Since 1995, Mitarbeiter of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational rehabilitation of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was able to be exhibited for the first time at the Museums BW Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint scheme, while the transformers were overhauled and five locomotives were operational.
The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Silesian Mountains Railway and its branch lines, where they proved their reliability and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to the Mitteldeutsche network.
Initially, the main area of operations was Silesia.
The H0 handwork model in OVP, with a good function, it has optical repairs to the locomotive in its own work, it is dusty and has play marks, it is a very rare handwork model, it may have come from the small series firm Zschutschke and Bachmann.
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.

A house fire with two lightly injured and high damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a house in Oberbayern.
In addition, damage in the six- figure range has been estimated. The police announced this on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport on the grounds of the neighboring house in Kinsau ( Landsberg am Lech County ) .
Two residents were taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect a deliberate fire.
The Kripo of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
Then,, however,, it comes much later.
And he has to pay shipping costs again.
To counter Fake News, Biontech CEo publishes an Impf photo.
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in 2021 on the social network " LinkedIn " .
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously spoken publicly about his vaccination status.
Now, the entrepreneur published a photo that shows his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend led him to do this,, Şahin said.
The CEO and co---founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccine against the Coronavirus.
In the social media, there were false reports that he was not vaccinated.
In fact, his wife and he have received three doses of the Biontech- Pfizer vaccine, he wrote on Friday in an article in the network " LinkedIn " .
"For several months, friends have urged him to post a photo of him being vaccinated, to counter the false rumors.
He had previously rejected it because the communication did not revolve around him personally.
But a call in the previous week changed his opinion: " He was deeply saddened when he learned that an old school friend of his was currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe case of the disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often caused by misinformation and mistrust. "
Fear is hard to overcome with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In the Internet, circulated an interview with the German Wave, in which Uğur Şahin said that he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as well as the German Wave itself clarified.
" At that time, it was not legally allowed for him to receive the vaccine himself. "
There is a priority in the distribution of the vaccine in Germany.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been abolished - and the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in the Umspannanlage and thousands of people without electricity.
In several municipalities in North Rhine- Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening, there was no electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had knocked out a transmission station.

Firefighters and members of the THW provided assistance in the municipalities.
The authorities offered shelter in schools and called on neighbors to help.
The supplier thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
They are aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
They also thanked the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their unremitting efforts.
The repair of the damage would still take several days, as the Westnetz workers were only able to temporarily reopen some of the lines. he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to the company's statement.
The water is flowing again.
The fire, which broke out on Friday at 19:15, had, according to Westnetz, heavily damaged parts of the 10,000 volt switching station in Neunkirch- Seelscheid.
Detailed cleaning and repair works were necessary.
At the same time, an attachment to a 30,000 volt level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 18 Uhr, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth again had electricity.
Further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen- Seelscheid were gradually added from 21.30.

More than 80 workers from Westnet and partner companies were involved.
The authorities had after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon also called for neighborhood assistance.
"What is important now is that the citizens take care of the elderly and lonely people in their neighborhoods and report to the local fire brigade stations when help is needed,, said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU ) after a crisis meeting.
The main focus was on the residents of old people's homes when it came to the setting up and operation of emergency power plants..
In addition,, according to Behördenangagement, temporary care places were established in schools for those who were not able to care for themselves or those who depended on medical equipment that required electricity.

In order for the coloring to be even and clean, he should clean the parts with a little soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse it with clear water and dry it.
Before the pencil touches the model for the first time with a new color, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
This can be done on the inside of the building or on a yoghurt cup..
The first stroke on the building.
He draws the pencil in an even manner, stroke by stroke.
The overlapping of the color layers later creates a uniform surface.
Avoid rapid back and forth strokes with the pencil.
This results in unrealistically shaped areas.
A model is not a fence.
Begin with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark could later emerge.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come at the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metallic streaks can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Lasse the painted parts dry for a day before destroying them.
The original appearance of the models is achieved by the decals or abrasion figures.
From military insignia on aircraft to ship names, to decorations and identification marks on automodels, the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Bringing the decals in the correct sequence, while the parts are still easy to reach.
A plane's cockpit can be attached to the fuselage before it is installed in the fuselage..
More important than the right tools, such as scissors, pinchers and toothpicks, are patience and a calm hand during the gluing process.
He cuts out each required decal individually and arranges them accordingly.
Decals are also known as water--shaded pictures because their backsides are moistened with water until the carrier paper becomes dark.
Dann Danny moves the picture only a little bit from the paper and puts the piece of paper on the corresponding place on the model ( which he had previously moistened ) .
Whilst Du holds the decal on the model with a tool, he pulls away the backing paper on the side.
Attention, he must first check that the picture is in the right place before he removes it completely from the paper, so that it does not stick to his fingers, wrinkle or tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years.
He can only open the book for a short time as soon as he looks at something else, then he can no longer read the book and has to withdraw and rejoin and reopen the book and look for the place where he has read.

Also for all 3 packages.
However, the lamp came in 3 separate packages to him.
despite this, many thanks.
Then, when the money is returned, he would go elsewhere to buy.
It is easy for him to get it back.
Childbearing treatment at the PKV and the meaning of the term " accident "
Hello together,
They had been in the custody of the Children's Welfare Agency for some time, and now, when it comes to the settlement with the PKV,, they suddenly become an obstacle.
The Series after.
They had applied for the Children's Welfare Program at the PKV beforehand and were granted three attempts.
The experiments were not limited in any way ( e.g. time, success, etc. ) .
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was compensated by the PKV.
A few months later, they attempted to have a second child, and carried out two ( unsuccessful ) attempts, which they attributed to the PKV.
They applied again for the costs to be reimbursed by the PKV and were granted three more attempts.
After several more attempts ( there were more attempts than agreed upon, logically the most expensive ones are reimbursed by the PKV ) they submitted the reimbursement requests to the PKV and received the disappointing news that instead of 5 attempts ( 2 and 3 ) the PKV would only reimburse 3 attempts.
The justification is that with pregnancy and birth, the other two attempts of the first promise fail.
The second Children's Wish was a new case.
According to the AGB, the accident begins with the healing process and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists.
The questions to the experts in the round here.
Who has the right here is the PKV ( only 3 attempts are reimbursed ) or they ( there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed ).
The PKV should have warned the participants in the contracts that with a birth, the further attempts would be lost.
The desire for a second child is a new cause for concern.
The inability to conceive ( caused by blocked sperm tubes ) is not healed by the first child.
It would be super if the experts here would give their opinion.
Many thanks for the first time for their help.
He could give him the three variants by email and told him how he would best reach them.
In order.
They will not be getting anything from them anymore..
When they add up the turnovers of him and his friend # Name # ( the same address ) they have apparently lost good customers.
They are allowed to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, his colleague told him that the reimbursement had been ordered and now he says that he must first send the thing back.
He can't do anything to prevent the commode from being completely destroyed at his home.
The colleague wrote in the screenshot that he had written.
It is clear and clear that the reimbursement was ordered and he has never received a reimbursement from the PRS organization.
They can arrange with their manager that they have lost two Stammkunden.
His friend has also ordered various pieces of furniture for their apartment through his account..
This is no longer being done..
However, the Defeat did not appear until several months later.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell him as a desk chair.
Regardless of this,, the guarantee period is 24 months.
It is not possible for him to obtain another type of packaging.
He will dismantle the cabinet and hand it over to the transport company so that it can be transported..
A good day, he has a question to his series of PRS Org.
These products are advertised with additional hockers,, but they are unfortunately not available at them.
They can help.
The theme of the week is the best low budget films.
A low- budget film is a film with a low budget. There is no general definition of what a low budget film is, and there are no exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say about it.
A low budget film or low budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the Internet, there are a lot of lists of low- budget films,, such as on Letterboxd.
They are interesting representatives of this category.
What attracts them to it.
and what fell overwhelmingly to the ground.
He is a very good acquaintance of them, has already set up two complete apartments with their furniture.
Wanted the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time was now extended again, it is now also reliable.
Many thanks.
With friendly greetings
There is no telephone number, a chat where one has to wait 30 minutes is not a chat.
However, nothing has changed in the waiting position. he will soon give up again, because it simply does not work there.
Hello
A " half victory " against Belarus with high costs for the EU.
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a " half victory " in the conflict with the Belarussian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Association (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the conflict, said the researcher of the Berlin Stiftung for Science and Policy (SWP).
This state of stalemate - Belarus does not give up completely, but the EU feels like the winner - is likely to continue for a while.
The handling of the people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
There is an " increasing normalization of pushbacks " by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided to oppose it, it goes at the expense of the fundamental rights.
This development weakened the unity of the Union.
"She can not, apparently, force her way through when a member state sets itself in the way,, such as Poland, which does not allow Frontex, the EU's border protection agency, to gain access to the border.
In addition to this, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, as Bossong said. A basic agreement on asylum policy has been hampered, as the line " border guard, border guard, border guard " has been strengthened.
A second attempt to cross the border.
According to the Polish Border Guard, migrants have attempted to enter Polish territory from Belarus again.
55 migrants were arrested in the night of Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokeswoman for the agency on Sunday.
The Polish officials were attacked by the migrants with stones near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday night, a group of 28 migrants overcame the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU is throwing out Alexander Lukaschenko as the ruler in Minsk, they with the prospect of being allowed to enter the EU.
Poland and Lithuania closed border crossings according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving..
The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines. said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination with hard measures and extraterritorial sanctions to operate.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarussian society was not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus would regularly send thousands of people through the border.
Mercedes protested after the controversial Formula 1 final.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes filed an appeal.

The manoeuvre occurred shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase in which the Dutch driver ahead of him had overtaken.
He tests it.
He speaks with the bank and reports to them again.

Judith Hermann read from her novel " Daheim "
In the context of the literary tour " LiteraTour Nord " the author Judith Hermann performed on Friday in the sold- out Blue Note with her latest novel " Daheim " and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced and lives in a house on the coast and is sensitive to the nightly sounds at her front door.
He applied for the return of an item through the contact form the day before, but has not received an email confirmation or similar.
His question was whether his request had been initiated.
It has not everyone the time for their bizarre chat and poorly delivered junk from China.
Their mistakes, which they rectify and not all from their household.
Contacting Ms. # Name #.
He can't chat with them every day.
They had met the day before and agreed that they would each receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a renewed order for the PRS Org bedside table and a return ticket.
This e--mail has not been received before..
The Paket wants to deliver the package to PRS Org today..
I want to talk to him.
With friendly greetings
The Lok Sound 5 Decoder is capable of simultaneously reproducing up to 10 channels.
Each channel can be recorded with up to 16 bits and 31,250 kHz, and offers high--fi quality on their equipment.
It is practically no difference from the original in terms of sound.
A Class D audio endstufe with up to 3 watts of output power controls the speakers, which have an impedance between 4 and 32.
The enormous 128 Mbit sound storage has sufficient capacity.
All the individual sounds can be individually adjusted in terms of volume.
The super- flexible Soundengine without a fixed storyline permits the accurate simulation of all conceivable railway vehicles.
Three independent braking functions and two alternative load scenarios give them the maximum control over their vehicles.
Sorry but only because he says he is not an anti--semitist means nothing.
This is the same as when an athlete says he has nothing against foreigners.
They are both not willing to give up.
However, Kollegah constantly reproduces various antisemitic messages.
When one wants to distance oneself, one should do it completely.
Then, he is as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Someone who seriously questions the validity of the theory of evolution is completely lost.
In other words, God has put the whole world in motion.
As soon as he becomes a creationist, he must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that the science is nonsense.
And as a result, he is an enemy of science and is not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the telescope should be placed as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic and achromatic shaped lens system allows them to use the lens in a practically error- free manner up to the edge zone.
Lupes are often marked with magnification indications.
These figures apply, however, only to exactly fixed conditions, which seldom correspond to the use conditions.
In order to use her lens optimally, they are asked to take into account the indications in the table " Technical data " (see the instructions in the packaging).
On the surface of the lens of all optical devices – including telescopes – there are light reflections.
By means of an antireflex surface, these reflections are significantly reduced.
Under optimal use conditions - with the lens close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information is contained in the accompanying instruction manual ( in German and English ).

Hello members of the # PRS 's Org. team.
He has already been registered with the Kundenkontakt under the number #Phonenumber #.
However, it was called before..
They can not deliver from England because of PRS Org.
Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde. in the municipality of Krembz, women search for the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many strange situations at the Christmas tree sale.
Once, a man was even able to return home without his partner, because they could not agree on anything.
Every year he plants about 2000 of them.
In the meantime, the 56-year old has already experienced a number of bizarre situations..
This makes the pre--Christmas period always a little fun. he says.
And with the voucher.
Otherwise, he is away as a customer.
In other words, he received a defective delivery and had to pay the full price for it.
Then he would also be judged accordingly.
There is no need for discussions about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning spit.
And both have therefore their name.
In English, an equivalent might be something like the "Dredger, which does not sound as tasty.
Problems with fiber optics and Devolo DLan or Magic.
They have had a new glass fibre connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, he has problems with building a stable WiFi network.
Previously, he had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used the Devolo DLan system, which, with the exception of a few failures, transmitted and received 50 Mbit.
The new Glasfaser connection sends 500 Mbit to the Fritzbox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the Fritzbox.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the WiFi signal, receives less than the full 500 watts as he moves farther away from the module ( i.e. a plug that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module receives less than the full 500 watts ) .
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new Glasfaser connection is now even slower than before ( ~ 45 Mbit ).
He also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLAN, but there were also large losses.
It is difficult to explain why so much internet speed is lost through the Stromleitung..
And LAN is actually the best solution.
It would have been extremely expensive to lay new LAN cable in the house.
He is really at a loss as to why he has created an extra account..
Therefore, he would have been even more pleased to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the Girokonto.
The one who had thought that the Girokonts would now have a period of peace is disappointed.
Whilst many banks have used the autumn to trick their customers into agreeing to higher fees in order to compensate for the negative fees of the past, they have also lowered the threshold for negative fees.
The German Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a ceiling of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the Freebet and quadrupled the Tagesgeld.
In the first step, the border was only lowered for customers of the Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros for Giro and Anlagekonts and 25,000 euros for Tagesgeldkonts.
In the meantime, the lower Freibeträge have been established for the entire German Bank,, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
and not only for new contracts, but also for " new individual agreements with existing customers.
The Commerzbank was already down to 50,000 euros before, which still applies, as well as at the Inge Deutschland.
The DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the freebet levels in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and then to 25,000 euros.
In total, more than 100 banks now have a freebet of 25,000 euros or less.
Even the Sparda Bank Berlin has reached 25,000 euros. However, there is still a legal dispute with the Consumers' Union, which won in the first instance at the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
In the banks, discussions have already begun about the possibility that the institutes might have to pay compensation in the event that the upper courts declare the negative interest rates in principle unacceptable and millions of bank customers have to be reimbursed.
The table for 8 persons was delivered instead of the one for 6 persons.
The undergallery is that for 6 persons.
Jennifer Aniston has a whole Beauty Army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and valley journey.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected by the US magazine " The Hollywood Reporter " as the most influential woman of the year.
For her,, who in 2021 with the " Friends " reunion and the continuation of her series " The Morning Show " caused a furor,, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Her appearance is looked after by a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers.
However,, as Aniston said, she gave herself a chip a day ( a single chip from the bag ).
That the hearts of the female and male fans are still equally captivated by her is a miracle.
Perhaps, because they have been unlucky with love and are still looking for the great love.
and the baby wish from the list has been removed.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who questioned him did not know what was going on with him medically, why he could not play.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to hope that success and fame will also bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career, Räikkönen has to retire.
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from the Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42 year old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a technical failure and a minor collision, Räikkönen had to abandon his Alfa Romeo after only half of the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix that the " Ice Man " ended his career in the Motorsport King's class.
His wife Minttu and the two children were also on the trip to the United Arabian Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest achievement was winning the World Championship in 2007 in the Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. DPA.
Friedrich won the 60th World Cup victory - Nolte won the double bob.
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
He has calculated that he would have to win nine and a half races in a season to make it to Cortina 2026, and that he achieved two victories in two days at the Winterberg races.
First, he repelled the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he went from rank three to one.
He then altered his approach to the material and ran on Sunday with a 0.30 second advantage.
With his team Thorsten Margis ( SV Halle , Candy Bauer ( BSC Oberbärenburg ) and Alexander Schiller ( SV Halle ) he defeated the Briton Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded,, said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd victory in a row.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, competing for Stuttgart, moved up to second place the previous time but came fifth this time.
Christoph Hafer from the BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race and eighth in the second race.
"If he knew what he was doing differently, he would also do it in the same way. Lochner said.
Nolte with a home victory and a podium for Jamanka.
In the women's competition, Laura Nolte won the third seasonal victory in the two- person bob on her home track.
After finishing fourth in the Monobob on the previous day, she raced to the World Cup victory with anchorwoman Deborah Levi.
Double Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia and Germany's fastest sprinter Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen came in second.
She scored alongside her Olympic qualification the first podium in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig in third place.
For me, it was super cool to get the first podium in the World Cup, he was very happy that Mariama was with him.
He is super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start,, but the start times today were okay, said Burghardt and emphasized that " it is not just the start, but there is also a lot of work around it. "
Jamanka complained a little about the not entirely flawless journeys, but said that they were going in the right direction.
He had the Decke in his Warenkorb and could now buy it.
I don't know what to do.
He has not received it and therefore has not been able to redeem it, which is why he finally asked for it.
Due to Corona, he had other problems last year and never had time for it.
And then he said he had run out, which made him very angry.
They were discussing the Asare Sitting Bank.
I want to return it and then buy it again, because it is currently reduced..
The reason for the start of the delivery on the 16th of March.
There was no mention of such a long delivery time on their website.
There is no extra field with the Melding if it comes up first.
She was dismissed by her colleague the day before..
The reason for this today is a problem.
He also sent them pictures of the wrongly delivered Ware.
But they still want the Regal module, even though it is new and undamaged.
and not to cancel the entire order.
Only for one day, only for one week, only until XY.
Hello, the lovely beautiful women and girls and women.
He has a lot of things he wants to write about and he wants to write it in English or another language..
He is 24 years old, has KPTBS, is a full--time student and a dog mother - apart from the fact that her dog does not scream or goes to the kindergarten, he is essentially her child.
His friend ( since 6 years ) is ill and has suffered a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years ( but is now in therapy ) .
He visited him yesterday because he also has emotional needs and because he wants to see and feel him, they had a lot of cuddling and it was nice.
He helped him in the shower ( because his hand was in a bandage due to a burn )
He is also suffering from a cold, and they see each other only once or twice a week, which makes it difficult for him to fulfill his needs for affection and love.
My dog has a stomach ache, he has been fed and is now lying in his cushion and has relaxed a bit after being warmed with a heat lamp and stroked.
He lives alone with his sister and his mother, who is away for a month.
Now they also have to do housework, which they divide between them.
But even cooking for himself is a lot of work for him.
His PTBS illness is now quite well settled, he is halfway through therapy and is coming to terms with it.
Not good, but he comes through and is almost symptom free..
His university demands a lot ( for him ) at the moment, he has a written test tomorrow at 15:00 and an anatomy lesson the next day for which he had not prepared at all.
And the next week, he has an oral examination on the 15th, and what comes after that is in his calendar and not in his head, because there is no room for it in his head.
As well, his week goes like this: Only until the next day, then it is the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on.
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until the end of the month..
And so it goes on forever.
I believe that he is just so stressed that he needs these mental anchors, because otherwise he can't do it.
In some way, I feel guilty and " chaotic " but in a different way.
It's also the case with them.
Honestly, he is endlessly grateful that he does not have to work.
He was really unendingly grateful, he could not put it into words.
He doesn't know whether he would have survived otherwise..
I believe that this also has a lot to do with the Mental Load of women and that is why she thought that she would find fellow sufferers there.
I wish them to have an enjoyable evening, the week is almost over.
Today, he received his order, unfortunately, the whole color is different, the surface is scratched and the table legs are imprinted.
In the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
They are very disappointed.
What they can offer to him.
When they change the table, he will get a different color or something like that..
The email for the cancellation was sent on the 26th of December..
In other words, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
This was completely different, in the school, it was established that many of the religion teachers did not believe in God and it was just another subject like mathematics or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps also because he was brought up in a Christian way and he always believed in something.
As it stands.
Possibly, he can also talk to his colleagues from work or from studies with different perspectives.
Basically, he understands the difference between private and professional and it is beneficial to separate them.
There is also a learning plan.
But he also found it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes one want to teach religion when they do not believe in it..
culture preservation or something like that.
The question is not too personal.
If it cannot be changed or not, it is written in English, which he also understands well.
This has been going on for a long time, then he would avoid it.
It's good, thanks.
He expects a response within a short time, at the latest by the beginning of the next week.
Thanks to their support, #Name #.
Film search help.
Hello beloved people.
He is looking for a film from his childhood ( he is 24 ).
I believe it was a film for young people.
In the film, there are two time axes ( or parallel worlds ).
The Modern ( real world )
The other is the past ( or the realm of the dead ( not entirely certain ) .
Because he cannot describe it in detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the Kingdom of the Dead, a young soldier ( uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the Fluch of the Caribbean.
For some reason, the paths cross and a story emerges.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Kingdom of the Dead, who the woman wants to bring to the Kingdom of the Dead so that she can survive.
The transition is probably also the grave of the soldier..
At the end, the two soldiers are fighting each other.
If he says something, he is grateful for every response.
From Week 1, Unsere Kleine has only slept on its belly.
He is still alive..
Relax.
A child can withstand much more than is expected.
Care to ensure that everything around it is in order, no cuddly toys, more frequent inspection, but no minute surveillance.
This makes him crazy.
Fresh air in the room.
A good mattress.
No cushions.
And so they had no sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Observe his child when it sleeps.
Turned the head to the side.
It can be lifted from the waist upwards.
Or it lies with the face forward Directly in the mattress.
It can be inferred from this that everything is in order.
They are also all grown up and when my husband came into the world, it was also the case that the children were put on the man's chest to sleep.
In addition, they are already " Stammkunde " with them and have already bought many articles.
But they only offered him 20 euros.
Hello, he had written to a colleague of theirs the day before and had not received a response.
It's about his wardrobe closet, which arrived the day before ( serial number # Alphabetic number ).
The right shelf does not fit in the shelf.
He asked her to contact him as soon as possible.
The shelf is currently not to be used.
To make it clear to say.
RBTV has made many promises.
And he himself knows that he cannot keep all of it.
And he had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply the case that the politics of this channel is now under all sorts of scrutiny.
Every format is sponsored ( okay, but then they go on a begging tour at the same time. )
It was said that it was an " independent " television station.
Quoting Arno, he wanted to be " no running litfaßsäule. "
What he is now.
A 0815 advertising channel that tries to sell its Billo merchandise to the elite fan.
And then they have Marah's Do's and Don 'ts.
The natural for everyone, with the exception of Simon and Etienne.
The düren are allowed to continue to insult the people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the explosion of the rented rooms, tries to make Asche.
It is not easy to find all of this good.
It's good when it is liked, I find it horrible.
He asked for a return call because his delivered wooden table was defective.
Corpus breakdown due to the damaged delivery of the PRS Org.
As a healer for a stomachache or just for cuddling, his small warm friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Chestnuts are a traditional home remedy for comforting warmth, as chestnuts are good at absorbing and releasing warmth.

Darmstadt after the first half of the season against Pauli won in Düsseldorf.
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
For Ingolstadt, it is also not going well under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut of new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
The battery is broken.
On the evening of the previous day, his laptop ( a Thinkpad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old ) was no longer able to be powered by his power supply.
This was bought about 5 months ago and should still work..
He thought that the Netzteil alone would be enough to operate.
Failure, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start even with the plugged-- in power supply.
Thereafter, he took the battery apart, but still nothing happened.
Maybe they have ideas.
A new battery has been ordered,, but it is not possible to use the laptop in networked operation.
There is something wrong with it.
Many thanks for their help.
He wants the delivery of the PRS Org until the room.
How to book it.
He is interested in the # PRS Organization 's chair..
He does not know how high the seat is.
Often on tour and still with a lot of equipment.
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem.
The 20- liter capacity can accommodate larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stowed in the padded FlexFold partition.
and the other things he needs for everyday use are also well organised and separated from the photo equipment in the individually configurable interior.
With the " Update " of the Everyday Line on the version 2 ( V2 ) the series is also presented in a new look.
The stylish and minimalistic design has it sprichwörtly in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed several highly innovative solutions that effectively protect the interior of the rucksack and yet provide quick access to the photo equipment.
This is achieved by two ways: firstly conventionally through the lid, which can be closed with the Maglatch closure system, which has already proved effective in the Messenger Bags.
In the closure hatch, there is a closure hook made of metal with a corresponding anchor bar on the front side of the rucksack.
Unlike most backpacks, the Peak Design has several " filling levels " - it has four anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be inserted.
When the rucksack is full, he takes the highest beam, when it is less full he takes a lower beam.
The Klappenverschluss and Haken are also magnetic.
The rucksack can also be closed reliably without the hook being inserted.
The second possibility of the Everyday Backpack is fundamentally different from other backpacks, in that it has two Reissverschluss openings on both sides of the backpack, in addition to the hatch.
It eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from the top - it is no longer necessary to rummage through the contents.
At the same time, this clever detail enhances the everyday usability of the rucksack enormously when he carries not only his photo equipment, but also everyday objects or travel gear.
In the Everyday Backpack, the interior can be individually configured (more about this below) and so both of them can be separated from each other without any problems, and can also be accessed from the two side openings.
This also allows him to pull the rucksack from the right side of the body, to reach the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain in the left half of the rucksack and do not interfere with each other.
Comfortable and easy to adjust straps help.
And since the outside of the rucksack is made of 100 % recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even when travelling to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, she has been waiting in vain for the email from her support.
# Name # has sent him a letter of confirmation for the appointment.
The shipping company has announced that it would pick up the wrongly delivered tables.
As of now, he has not received any news.
He wants the case to be settled immediately..
He has already written with the third support staff member, in none of them he went further than to the promise that he would receive a letter as a confirmation.
It concerns the return of the wrongly delivered Custom # Name #.
It is impossible to predict when the cabinet will be delivered again.
It is not an option for him to stay..
It works.
Many, many thanks for the help.
Wish them a beautiful evening.
Hello, his number is # Number # and when the article is delivered.
Ordering and payment took place on 12 January 2021.
He received a completely different lamp than he had ordered..
I want to call him.
If he gave him the extension of the contract, he would immediately make a larger order,, but he kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
and that the previous year was different than expected, he did not anticipate it and was not able to fulfill it in time.
However, the damage was done to him as a customer and he does not accept this..
Rotinger brake plates are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of the braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake plates are made of cast iron and then mechanically processed ( drilled and cut ) .
All the broken glass is produced in short series according to the individual technical characteristics of the glass and the pattern, which are unique to certain glass and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which focuses on the distribution of the glass after the characteristics of the original mounting.
The coated discs, produced in this way, ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the glass, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake plates and brake blocks.
The aesthetic characteristics of their tuned glasses emphasize the attractive and striking appearance of the character of each car.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered a glowing rock in the water on the southern bank of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and led to the so-called " California Gold Rush " of 1849.
Thousands came from near and far to make Coloma one of the fastest growing and prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were erected and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted to share in the wealth of the country.
For many it was " Coloma or Bankrupt "
In this game, he is a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
He will search for gold, recruit workers, breed horses and set up businesses.
He will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river flows and surrounding areas.
He is not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea.
He must outperform his Pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
They vote simultaneously for their actions, have to manage their resources and build a tableau that works more and more for them ( so--called " engine building " ) .
The buildings on his tableau allow him to become more efficient, gain additional actions or turn the tide in his favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, he can develop his individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 ( the year in which the gold in Coloma was discovered ) to 1850 ( the year in which California became an official state ).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After this, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
When a location has the most Pioneers, it receives a Sperre.
This deactivated the one half of the area - which reduces the possible actions in that area.
Then the players take turns to perform actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up camps, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions have been completed, the Pioneers return.
The Anpreiser starts at the beginning of each round at a new location, thereby changing the available actions.
This goes on until the Anpreiser has moved five times and has covered each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the player Coloma must defend against an attack by ferocious bandits.
When enough Revolverhelden have been contributed and the bandits are numerically superior, the players receive rewards.
When they fail, they receive smaller rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is made.

"Why Children are not Tyrants " Documentary, the ARD archive.
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse and power abuse
The ARD documentary has appeared in his Twitter timeline today, and he watched it immediately.
The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest in talk shows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his 2008 book " Why their children become tyrants " he caused a heated debate about child-- raising.
Former patients and caregivers have now raised serious accusations against him.
The film is difficult to watch.
And he is very grateful that many people now think differently and act differently.
The parents and other responsible persons can never, never, never have power over the child.
Their goal must always be to give the child freedom for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is appropriate and possible in the situation.
It still makes him shudder.

They occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common result is the hearing of sounds or voices, less common is the seeing of pictures, and the rarest is the perception of pain.
For this topic, caesarean sections are operations that are associated with a high rate of awareness, as they protect the child until it is weaned from its mother by means of a very deep anesthetic.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthetic pre--surgical briefing.
Certain anesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) carry with them a slight increase in risk.
This comment from him describes Awareness correctly,, however, he did not have the awareness per definition.
She misinterpreted his comment.
The chair is, however, defective.

Thanks to the Power Level Regulator, the entire potential of the VT + series can be used in every situation.

Here, he must not do anything further.
This is what he wants to avoid, that's why he writes to him.
He would like to take over the return on his own costs.
The 8 euro return fee is in his eyes an outrage.
It is time for change.
The German parliament welcomed him and he was greeted in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day.
The reason for the post here.
When one looks at the activity of the German Bundestag in the past months, it can be seen that it is not existent.
They are in a winter slump and have extended the summer gap for several months.
The problem is where it lies.
The reason for this is that.
For the most part, this is related to the dissatisfaction, as a number of things have been dismantled and as a whole, they are dissatisfied.
In the last few days, the impression has emerged that many still have a strong desire to participate in the MBundestag.
#The changes they have to make.
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is called upon to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u and edizvevo, who had become aware of the project in the last few days and found a heap of rubble in front of it.
After some back and forth, a number of people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, he also wants to call on people to participate in the project, only then it can survive in the future.
They have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which they can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
The server can be entered through this link.
Goals
How the MBundestag will function in the future.
The existing orders must be changed, adapted or removed.
As to how they should appear in the future.
As new members are to be recruited.
To achieve a fair election system.
He is quite certain that he has forgotten some things, which is not a problem,, but the end result is the discord.
When they have the desire and time, they come to the Discord and work with and decide the future democratically.
He has also ordered a lamp shade from them, which is still to be delivered..
Now he sees that the article is too large and that it is not suitable for his taste.

He put it together and noticed this when he took the soft foam.
He is very sad about it.
He hopes that it will be returned and that he will receive a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the # Name # is much darker than expected.
He also has a question: the Tagesdecke # PRS- Org. is also available in over- size, in 240 x 240, for example.
The PRS must ensure that the faulty shelf is removed as quickly as possible.
And he begged her to make it happen.
A suitable packaging has not been found, he will dismantle the shelf as much as possible to facilitate the removal - it is up to the PRS organization to determine how this can be done.
PRS can contact him by telephone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.

As to the question of why they are vegan.
Today, he had a conversation with a colleague whom he likes.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while and eats very rarely meat now.
He himself was also a vegetarian for several years.
On being asked whether he had always wanted to be a vegan, and that vegetarianism was a planned interim step,, he responded without hesitation.
and that he long thought that as a vegetarian he was supporting the welfare of animals, but eventually realized and understood that he was in fact supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, his decision to become vegan.
At that moment, she had the impression that Missmut had come to her side, and then defended vegetarianism, saying that she knew where her meat came from and that vegetarians reduce the suffering of animals.
Now, he is asking himself whether his response to " plump " was.
They responded to the question.
He has the feeling that as a vegan, he is quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise, without him trying to provoke them.
It greets a harmonious vegan.
It is not an exception to § 312d of the BGB.
Their # PRS Org. does not exempt them from the legal requirements for long--distance distribution.

Thanks first and foremost for the fact that he took on the whole thing, he has also been in the States service for almost a decade in a similar role and he was also a weapons carrier in the Executive, and he did not want to comment on it.
The question of right and left is always presented in a very simplistic way.
In general, it should be said that the Statesman comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary Left, which should be obvious to everyone.
Naturally, also in the special uniform and weapon carriers, people on the right of the conservative and magical side should also have been clear that these people, naturally, with the lived reality, would have been hard to deal with. Naturally, it is also clear that these people, naturally, with the average white, would have been many Germans with a migrant background, women and also homosexuals ( and this means not the overstated feminine stereotype of the homosexual, but rather normal men and women who are not noticeable when they do not announce themselves ) and also on these people, he can rely on them and must rely on them.
However, even these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, in other words, they are proud of Germany and feel that they are more alienated by overbearing left--wing politics, even though they perceive these policies to be in their interest.
Back to the right, since the police and the armed forces are also a cross section of society, there are also extreme right--wingers there,, but they are allowed to openly express their opinions there, or even openly plan to endanger the state, and this is overstated in the media and also irritates him.
Naturally, it also happens that police officers and soldiers, who were often in overseas missions, often began to stereotype and say things that are controversial and politically incorrect.
Also, there are also times when reputed right--wing friends meet and engage in a vigorous exchange of ideas..
However, this is countered well and with political education and enlightenment.
Germany is so heavily international entangled and this is also a good thing according to his opinion that it is not possible for it to have right--wing racists and Nazis in its ranks.
Yes, what he does not understand, the other box has also been ordered from the German side.

Hello, a 32- year old man has been dealing with this issue for a long time.
On the job, he is very disciplined and organised ( is self--employed and has very little leisure time, but he has been unable to keep his house clean and orderly for most of his life.

But it is never so " that someone could spontaneously come to visit " .
His husband is (unsurprisingly ) also not better, it bothers him somewhat, but he loses out to work and unlust most of the time.
The kitchen is still cleaned regularly because they like to cook.
Now to his question, they have succeeded in raising their children properly.
They do not have one yet, they are working on it and this question has been bothering him for a long time.
However, for him, he has no incentive, he is not bothered by it at all, as long as no visitors come and there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
If one has a child, one has a greater incentive or remains lazy.
He is looking forward to their responses.

A career in social work, as a person with an unstable personality.
He has an education in the field of software development and has been out of work for about a year.
However, he feels that this profession is not the right one for him, which is why he has been thinking for a long time that he should start again and study social work.
The problem is that he has a self--unsure ( i.e. ängstly avoiding ) personality disorder.
This means roughly that he has no self--esteem and is shy.
He does not have a problem with talking to people on a professional level, but it is difficult for him to engage in casual conversations, and he has been told that he comes across as unapproachable ( which he believes has improved somewhat ).
He can become a social worker.
He does not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in, for example, the drug advice or the family aid.
However, he does not know whether the actual work situation is as he imagines it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems ( for him, emotionally, because it makes him feel down every time something goes wrong with his code, and it is hard for him to ask his more experienced colleagues for help ( " he should already know how to do it himself " " he is holding him up with his incompetence " " he is held back by his inadequate salary " etc. ) .
The problems are likely to be present in all professions, but he wanted to emphasize them at that time.
The sofa has already been returned..
There was also no confirmation for that..
He is waiting for a pick--up time.
What they mean when they say they want to give back.
When a book is downloaded from the PRS Organization, the message comes that the author of the book has not been authorized by the PRS Organization.

The protein taken in with the food is broken down in the bird's gastrointestinal tract into the individual amino acids, which are then used to build the bird's own proteins, which it also needs for the formation of its feathers.
The plumage development of the nestling and the plumage redevelopment of the maturing bird are extremely complex processes and for the overall organism of the animal with a particularly high burden.
It is necessary to be aware of the fact that Nekton Bio cannot be fed during the breeding season because it can otherwise cause disturbances in the breeding process.
In the wake of this shortage of Nekton B, the daily supply of vitamins with Nekton S ( a multivitamin preparation ) and Nekton MS ( a mineral substance preparation ) was resumed.

The chair is being sold as a desk chair.
As a result of 9 months of use, a desk chair can break down.
The warranty period in Germany is 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, an email was sent to him on Monday to inform him that his order had been damaged and pictures were attached.
They have received this e--mail.
A statement from a member of the community in opposition to the statute.
Hello r / Legaladvice.
He has the following problem.
On their property, a walnut tree was to be felled.
Also a complaint was filed with the municipality.
An employee writes to him that the fall of fruit trees and therefore the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a tree to be protected in the statute.
He can now rely on the statement of the employee or not.
On the other hand, he has to rely on the opinion of an expert.
On the other hand, the constitution is unambiguous.
He thanked them for their response.
They understand.
Then they will use the new packaging for it.
He has not received a message.
Then, he still has an unused sofa..
He could have offered her a legacy or a gift certificate.
They were more expensive.
I believe this to be the case, but the question is whether he will be able to pay in euros and have the deck delivered to Germany afterward.
They can be tested.
Heavy traffic accident at Selb.
Not long ago, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Anschlussstelle Selb North and Plößberg.
According to the police's press alarm ( 14:03 Uhr ), a Pkw was overtaking in the opposite direction.
There are injured.
Okay, he understands..
Good, then many thanks that it went so smoothly.
Advice and ideas for a further career.
The first happy Christmas for them.
My Christmas, however, is not as good as it should be, because his beloved head is breaking down everything that can be broken down..
Before he goes on to talk about his situation, he says that he needs advice from people who understand his situation, that is, from them.
He is currently doing the Ref as a rookie..
Originally, he studied something else and worked in a related field ( in order to remain anonymous, he does not name it more specifically ).
The whole was then too boring for him, and he looked for alternatives that would be more fun for him.
At some point, he ended up in the clergy and was sure that this was the right path, even though the conditions were much more rigid than in his previous job, but he did not care.
He is now at the third " he googles other job positions " .
And it is only half a year since.
At the previous Malen, he always decided to continue and at least finish the Ref, after which he could still change his mind.
However, he is absolutely exhausted.
He had the last month so little free time that he was completely exhausted.
But there are still holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for him.
Before the Ref, he thought he was resistant to stress, but his weekend was also his weekend and his time off was his time off.
He had free time.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moment.
Now, he himself feels that the family celebration is too stressful.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy him.
Basically, it is fun and from the outside, the Ref is going well, judging by the feedback and so on.
But he is completely exhausted and is wondering how much stress his body can withstand before it completely closes down - which it is not doing at the moment.
He wonders whether he wants to continue in this way for the rest of his working life,, especially when he reads some of their contributions -, or whether he should go back to the old area, where he was respected, was able to take time off when he needed it, and worked in a team, rather than as a lone fighter as he does most of the time now.
But then, he wonders if he is in the same place a year later and still unhappy.
They notice that it is all somehow confused, but they may have ideas or suggestions as to how she, as an outsider, can find a way out of this situation, in which she is completely exhausted and begins to cry at the smallest thought of it.
Decisions are now being made in an emotional way, this is likely to lead to nothing good.
But perhaps their views can help to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnels, or to be able to celebrate Christmas, which is enough for the time being..
Thanks for the reading and apologized for the melancholic tone of his voice.
He hopes that his situation has become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of Vox has steadily evolved, leading to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the " Valve Reactor " scheduling, which perfectly imitates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20x, VT40x and VT100x Amps, they are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is on the cutting edge of technology in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology ( Virtual Element Technology , which is based on the analysis of the parts and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Also, these Amps also contain the multi--stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analogue circuitry because this gives the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated arrangement, the VTX amplifiers have an enclosed box and a bass--reflex system, from which the natural resonances flow.
With the " Tone Room " software from Vox, they can recreate historical facts on the virtual level, even correcting and distorting the sound of the amplifier and the effects so that they sound as they have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced Vox Valve Reactor technology.
It has since been revised several times to accommodate new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost in 2010 for the Vox Valvetronix series, with more dynamics and a number of new and decisive amplification models.
The new VT + Valvetronix series was also designed in such a way that all guitarists on the hunt for a maximum variety of sounds would be able to find it.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier, they expect a thick sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and an immediate response.
During an in-- depth analysis, the Vox engineers discovered that the endstages of the amplifiers had the characteristics of a valve amplifier and developed the Vox Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The 12AX7 tube- bestucced Valve Reactor Schaltung of each VT + amplifier creates the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA - Despite Wagner's 20 points, the Magic lost to the Clippers.
The defeat series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues..
The Wagner brothers can shine - but the victory against the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable - with three individually placed and foldable Velcro closure parts, it can be adapted to the needs of the photographer's equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras, ranging from spiegellose system cameras of all sizes to full--format spiegelreflex cameras.
Ultimately, what fits in the rucksack depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a spotlight.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for additional lenses.
In addition, one can also stow a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera ( MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series ) can use the backpack for their equipment and for other things.
Equipped with the Everyday Backpack 20L, even drone pilots have made a good choice, because the rucksack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including the remote control and equipment.
A volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma. the longest in history.
In the three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
There is an end in sight.
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary island of La Palma since Sunday.
Previously, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 lasted for 84 days and was the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable records of previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but vulcanologists were unable to predict when it would end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable " said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state television channel RTVE.
Damage in millions of euros.
In the three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000 degrees Celsius hot lava has destroyed more than 2,900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
This is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields..
More than 7,000 people had to be evacuated and the damage is estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Before the coast, erkalted lava created two new islands with an area of about 50 hectares.
The banana industry, which is crucial to the island's economy and from which approximately half of the island's 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly live, was severely affected, and which was already in crisis prior to the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were heavily damaged, the newspaper " El País " wrote.
Christmas and the gifts.
Christmas is on the doorstep and especially the children cannot wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension to have a seductive effect.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still unite the increasingly divided society.
It is of utmost importance to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a " peace--making contract between primitive societies " is revived and re-filled with life in the context of this tradition.
As from Nikolaus, the Christkind became.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who connected the Christmas days with the giving of gifts.
Previously, gifts were given on St. Nicholas' Day.
The background of this still today popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving gifts, the German tradition of filling the children's shoes with gifts emerged.
Protestants objected to the practice because they reject the idea of saints as intermediaries between God and man.
Because of these reasons, they oppose the institution.
Martin Luther made the Nikolaus into the Christkind, thereby laying the foundation for a new traditions line.
The focus of the celebration shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since the majority of Protestants no longer see these details as so important, only a few are angered by the fact that the tradition of St. Nicholas, similar to that of St. Martin with the singing of the St. Martin's hymn and the St. Martin's procession, is still firmly entrenched in the pre--Christmas period.
Today, one finds in Stiefelfeld before the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to sought- after luxury watches..
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the Feast of the Giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all the Christian countries, there is a chaos over the question of who will now bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region as to whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who in essence is a kind of St. Nicholas, and over time has acquired a number of peculiarities.
This includes, for example, his white Rauschebart, which is now only slightly similar to the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference of the chimneys to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure of the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy, the witch Bona Mama is responsible for guiding them to the infant Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes fairies bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought fame.
There are not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh.
In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars,, the Christkind is responsible for the distribution of the gifts.

The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module conceals " Smart Stone " discreetly in its interior, together with his battery and two LEDs - one for white and the other for colored light.
The battery is already loaded when sunlight falls on the housing.
As the sun begins to set, " Smart Stone " begins to glow on its own, in six different attractive light colors, besides the daylight white.
Also, the shutdown also takes place automatically when the battery's energy level falls to a predetermined minimum or is restored.
As soon as the sun rises again, the loading cycle begins the next day from the front.

Hello lovely women,
He hopes he has done everything right, this is his first post on reddit after a year..
Due to the fact that he had to take the Pill again forcibly about five years ago, mainly because he had such terrible pain during the Periode and terrible PMS before the Periode.
Now, he would like to stay there again, because he has to take a lot of medication due to chronic illnesses, which he cannot choose.
His main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but his skin.
During his last approximately two--year break from 0 to 100, he got explosive pimples all over his body..
As far as it is superficial, but it has affected him quite badly and he did not feel well.
In the two years of pause, the whole situation has not really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this happening again.
Perfume free and without fuss is his cosmetics already, but he may have someone recommend something to him.

It is also possible that Hormonell's hormonal disorder is the reason, but when he has so many construction sites, he prefers not to look for anything else that is going wrong..
He had already received all of his colleagues' seminars and lectures.

No, this is the case with all books, which is why the complaint was made to PRS Org, as it is a general problem.
Scheduling (EK )
Hello dear colleagues and colleagues.
He has been at the Ref since summer, he enjoys the teaching,, but he still has problems planning his geography lessons efficiently..
Unfortunately, his school is technically poorly equipped, so he can only use the blackboard, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In the school, he can also only copy in black and white. This is a problem for geography.
He is currently taking a long time to plan his hours..
For example, they are currently working on the theme of geofactors, and at the moment, he is working on the theme of geofactors alone.
In principle, the methods used are always the same, but on the other hand, he does not want to spend too much time on simple lessons ( which he also needs for UBs and so on).
When planning, he usually starts from the learning goal ( what he wants to achieve ) and then thinks about how he can achieve it ( he usually creates a sheet of paper with texts from books that his school does not have ) .
He has translated the book Terra and with the most of the tasks in the book, he is not satisfied.
Daher also the work sheets.
Maybe he can teach me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would have loved it.
I would like to return the PRS Org number from the order number.
He has already decided on a new job at the PRS, but he would like to terminate the contract as soon as possible..
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or cured are allowed to enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and complains of loss of income.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations damage from the point of view of the Handelsverbandes Deutschland ( HDE ) the important Christmas business of the retail trade.
In the case of businesses dealing with non- daily necessities, there were shortfalls in turnover. HDE's chief executive, Stefan Genth, criticized this..
According to a recent survey of the HDE among 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of the companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"Originally, the positive climax of the year was supposed to be, but is now often a hole without a bottom " said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost approximately a third of their pre--crisis turnover in the previous week.
It went well only in the grocery stores and in the online area.
The Federation demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with masks, distance and hygiene concept was a safe affair, said the head of the company.
" 2G in shopping brings them no further in the fight against the pandemic. he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a high level of personnel.
The bandage regulation must be nationally approved, he demanded.
After that, every customer would only have to be checked once for 2G ( having been vaccinated or cured ) and would be allowed to enter all businesses with the band on that day.
In addition,, in the retail trade,, as already in the public Nahverkehr with the 3G rule ( vaccinated, cured or tested ) , stichprobe controls would be sufficient.
Even the specialized on shopping centers real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The Frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre-- Corona levels and the umsales at about 90 percent.
These numbers are now in the middle of the so important Christmas business,, said chairman Wilhelm Wellner of the " Economic Week " .
Due to the high personnel and administrative burden, solutions were sought and approvals were granted.
This also includes the so-called Bändchen solution, in which " the visitors, for example, once at a central location in the center present their 2G proof and then, equipped with an armband similar to those used in a club hotel, can freely enter all the shops. DPA.
He has recently ordered and received the PRS Org. .
The Spiegel has a scratch and the frame also has a flaw, which was attempted to be camouflaged with a yellow filler.
It looks unpleasant.
He would like to return the Spiegel and has already packed it back into the package and sealed it.
As for the return journey, he must now proceed.
The Lampe is for Dual Balance constructed, based on new, flat SMD - LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp is controlled by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities.
In addition to the adjustment of the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and art light.
It is also possible to adjust the color temperature in the range of 3100 – 5650K manually and to store it.
They use the current settings in the flash memory.
One of the special features of the Controllers is that they are easy and intuitive to use.
The Leuchte produces a very strong light flow with soft light of high quality, completely free of flickering.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which large areas can be illuminated at a relatively small distance is impressive.
In addition, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to use both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional available DMX512 controller allows for the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in inaccessible places.
On the back of the Leuchte is the control panel, it consists of switches and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness level in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
In addition, there is a slot for the NP-F batteries ( not included in the delivery ).
The user can have up to three panels of lighting and color temperature.
In order to change the settings of the individual Einstellings on the memory slots, it is necessary to hold down the buttons of the memory slots for a longer period of time.
The lamp controller records the current state of the lamp when it is shut down, so that when it is shut down again, the known situation is restored - very practical when, for example, the camera is set to a specific color temperature.
Working with batteries is one of the major strengths of the DL3120. this is due to its ability to operate with suitable NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen ( and women ) - so they can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also be tested before the set, whether the batteries have sufficient power - it has a battery tester built in, for each of the two battery compartments there is a value in the two display annexes ( the upper annex of the left battery compartment and the lower annex of the right battery compartment.
In addition, it is possible to continuously supply power to the spotlight with the supplied power supply.
The construction of the projectors is very simple.
They have a 16 mm bolt as an attachment, allowing them to be directly attached to a photographer's tripod.
The inclination is ensured by stabilizers on both sides.
It was also emphasized that the mechanical components are extremely high- quality and as a result, are designed to be long- lasting and suitable for hard use.
In addition, a Neigegelenk is included in the delivery.
Grossartig is also the fact that the package also contains a bag.
This allows them to transport or store the light with all the accessories they want to buy, without problems.
It's a shame that it was given to him and it is too small.
"The party they wanted to throw " - Frankfurt celebrates a torrid comeback against Leverkusen.
It was a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in a row defeated Hessians appeared to be on the way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
However, the SGE then turned the tide, shot themselves within an hour and a half from the frustration of a poor start to the season and won furiously with 5-2. "It's insane what the boys have achieved today " jubilated coach Oliver Glasner at DAZn and spoke a " universal praise " to each individual who was involved.
At the start, it looked as if it would be another disappointment for the now ninth- placed Frankfurt team behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead against Leverkusen.
What then happened impressed the SG coach as well.
"As the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance, Glasner continued.
He is extremely happy with the performance of the team and also with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who returned to the field for the first time since the fourth matchday and overcame his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
The 27- year old believes that his team's mentality is enormous and was pleased with the result in particular for the spectators.
That was the party they wanted to throw.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, however, he also sees himself in a good position with regard to the personnel situation.
It is exceptional that all players are fit in December, that all players are in a top physical condition.
It is Top- Work in the medical department, but also the players live high professionally.
Now they want to " step by step " and " remain modest " and continue the tasks until the end of the year " at the same level.
The next match is scheduled for the following day, as part of the English Week, against Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30 on Sky).
He received the mail that his package was returned to him due to a mistake on his part.
He tried to call the PRS Organization, but it turned out to be unsuccessful..
It can be sent directly to him again or it must wait until the money is returned and the order is resubmitted.
This would then mean that he would not be ordered again because it had already been very long since he had been ordered..
They have already sat on the PRS' Organization 's chairs..
Damper for the women's handball team before the quarterfinal against Spain.
Germany's women's handball team stumbled after the humiliating defeat against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes from the court.
At the end of the main round of the World Championship, the DHB team suffered a heavy defeat against Spain with a score of 16-32 (8-13) before 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face the host country in the quarterfinals.
"They were too nervous and had too much respect for the opponent, according to Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
Against Spain, they must act differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8 - 2 points as second behind the Danes (10 – 0).
It is sad that they did not take the flow with them.
The whole team played a bad game and they have to be sacked, said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to qualify for the semifinals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on the following Tuesday in order to keep the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-- time Olympic champion Denmark was the wing player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"They were simply not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defence ", Xenia Smits conceded and demanded " they must now quickly look ahead ".
From front to back, not on the level.
Unlike in the previous five Turnierspieles, the German team was not at its best at the start of the game.
Misfires and technical errors in the attack and holes in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the job and prevented worse with several saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels completed a quick counterattack successfully.
However, the expected initial ignition did not take place.
Against the aggressive defence of the Danish women, the German women were hardly able to set themselves in scene - and when they did, they often failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was already lost after 20 minutes with a 3-10 deficit, and Mia Zschocke was sent to the bench for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, she can participate again.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB team started to get into the game and by the end of the first half they were only five goals behind.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes when the score was 9-19.
The Groener Schützlings sinned again in all areas and made it easy for the well--prepared opponent, which is one of the medal contenders in the final round.
As a result, the German team was not able to improve its performance and went as the clear loser from the court.

The Weihnachtsmann comes, the Christkind or the gift is from Oma and Opa.
No matter how they do it, they all try to make it as nice as possible as a family around Christmas..
Whether or not these are now established traditions or even vary from year to year, he tells them how it goes in his family.
Send him something like a transaction number or something else that could help..
overseas confirmation.
I would like to give him a gutschein code.
as with the PRS Org' gift vouchers.
goes the same way with them.
The title says it before, he is an impf doctor in mobile impf teams, where ( until now only ) the BioNTech and Pfizer impfstoffs are mainly used in care homes.
Since these are now almost finished, he then goes to a part of the immunization centers for him..
He is willing to answer questions without a time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also on medical issues, as long as they are not related to him personally (e.g. " He takes medication X and it is compatible with the vaccination. "
In his area of responsibility is the propagation for the immunization, the indication ( the person has the right to be immunized according to the tuberculosis immunization regulation and there are no reasons against it ), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency treatment of allergic reactions ( which has never occurred ). .
The injection itself can be delegated to qualified personnel,, e.g. medical assistants.
In the impfeteams, however, they are often lacking,, but " only " ( by God's will ) pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of the infectious substances, but they are not allowed to perform the injections themselves, so that he also performs most of the injections himself.
Heavy " Huidlerer " problem, Amberger knows the solution.
A "Huidlerer " is a person who is in the process of becoming a member of the Nazi Party.
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger,, it has caused a lot of thought in the BR television show " We in Bavaria " .
However, unlike on many previous days, the term remained unidentified by the callers on this occasion.
No, it was not a " nervous man ".
and also no one, " who has to go fast everywhere. "
The people heard that the TV presenter was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus caused a lot of astonishment among the Oberpfalzers.
The Huidlerer, as the audience learned, is a Lapp, who wipes the chimney.
Dialectologist Antony Rowley, from the Bavarian Television since years as an expert interviewed, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Oberpfalz word, derived somehow from the more familiar dialect word " Houdern.
With the closure of a gap in education - perhaps also for many who have lived in the area around Amberg for a long time.
He has been unable to buy books for two weeks.
After the confirmation comes the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
He has the #PRS # Org # reorganized, with the PC connected, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing has helped.
Choice of wheels for the racing bicycle is really safe.
In the morning, he woke up full of energy because he wanted to train for his bicycle tour in the coming week.
He said it, did it, and he took his racing bicycle, which he had bought the day before on eBay, with him.
The first 40 km were also beautiful,, but then the same thing happened in every inner city ( this time in Krefeld ) that lurks.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud squeals and his rear wheels did not want to participate in the rest of the route.
Because of the Wochendays, he did not have a real possibility to get him a replacement jacket and a replacement belt,, so he had to turn back and take the first available train back home.
Then, the technical situation was not so bad, perhaps it is even better when he repeats the change of the tyre before the Radtour..
Now, he stands before a question and hopes that they can help him.
Since he has a long journey ahead of him over several days, he would not want to face this problem again.
Now, it was not so bad, because the old tyres of the previous owner ( a very nice old man who came to pick up the bicycle on the day it was handed over and drove 140 km with them, which he described as " suboptimal " because he had been riding them for years on a roller.
But when he thinks that he will have to change a tyre after 80 to 90 km, he is really unhappy :D
Now, he was talking to an older man at the train station who asked him why he did not have the Marathon Plus tires, which are said to be unbreakable.
Now, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But they are not really so unbreakable.
I don't feel like spending 40 euros on a new pair of tyres, only to be disappointed.
In addition, he is wondering whether he has 25 times 622 on the racing bike.
However, there are also ( apparently ) wider grooves on the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are narrower.
This is a problem.
or they would have advised him to use other types of wheels.
The Schwalbe side seems to favor the Durano DD more than the Durano DD.
Thanks already in advance for the help and good wishes.
The car crashed against the tree and the driver was fatally injured.
The 53-year old was on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his wagon from an unknown cause against a middle island collided and then went onto the opposite side of the road, as the police reported.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27 year old.
The car of the 53- year old was then thrown against a tree and the man in the vehicle was trapped.
The 27 year old and his 23 year old co---pilot were severely injured in the crash and were taken to nearby hospitals.
They have removed all the books, they have all been authorized and new books have been installed.

For this, he received a confirmation by mail.
He has been told by his colleagues three times that she is reliable..
When the shipping company is in contact with him.
He has already written that he has not received his sms.
After the release of their new high end broadbanders B 100- 6 OHm, it was only a matter of time before the Solo Series would also receive new members.
The Solo 15 is called the new Sprössling and resembles visually the big predecessors with the B 200 – 6 OHm.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable design was included, which included the placement of the loudspeaker in the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted to the given circumstances in length.
The Solo 15 is well suited for people who are more interested in the quality of the sound rather than the loudness, but it is still possible to achieve a very high level of sound quality.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce such a large sound pressure level..
However, this does not mean that the Solo 15 sounds weak.
On the other hand, they grow up enormously and for their size are extremely impressive and accurate..
Tonal was the Solo 15 tuned with a slight high tone rise.
This is a common practice among broadbanders to increase the intensity of the beam by increasing the frequency.
Exactly on the pitch, the Solo 15 has a very clear and fine sound.
The high tone area can be reduced and so the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the location of the individual components of a musical piece is pinpointed with perfect stereophonic clarity and amazing precision.
The extremely low mechanical loss of the B 100 - 6 OHm reference causes it to have a sound similar to that of its counterpart.
The Solo 15 complements not only the Solo Series, enlarging it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of their Bausets, it is advisable to begin thinking about the final appearance of the speakers at the beginning of the construction, in order to make corresponding adjustments during the construction.
If, for example, the housing is to be furnished, the lowering of the speakers has to be adjusted accordingly, as the furnishing still adds material.
After all the plates had been cut,, a 8 mm hole was bored into the floor at the corresponding place to allow the cable to be easily inserted later.
With the help of an Oberfräse, the speaker opening in the front is now made, so that the B 100 – 6 OHm can later be placed bündig.
On the back, this opening was to be fitted with a 45° Fase to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHm are interrupted in the phase, as in the picture " Detail of the phase " shown.
After this, the actual construction of the box begins and one of the two sidewalls is placed on a flat surface in front of him.
On these, the rear wall, the ceiling, the front and the floor are glued.
There should also be the use of the three reinforcements and glued together.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in their material strength when needed,, for example, instead of making the reinforcements themselves from 16 mm MDF, they can be bought from the timber yard.
In the next stage, the second side is attached.
Afterwards, all of the plates of the foot, the two sides and the front, follow.
With the help of a suitable Lochkreissäge or a Forstnerbohrers, the holes of the bassreflexrohres are made, as well as the attachment of the connecting clamp on the back wall.
After that, a circular grinder is used to round all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the footplate can also be rounded.
In the aftermath, the footplate is firmly attached to the base of the case with glue and additionally fastened with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the mounting points of the speaker chassis and the attachment clamp.
After the house of wood dust was cleaned, the cable was laid.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm Bassreflex opening in the back wall.
Then the entire and uncut cable piece is pushed through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, where it is left protruding for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and left there loosely hanging.
Following this, the frequency changer is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the Frequenzweiche, as well as the corresponding attachment plan can be obtained from the construction manual for the Solo 15.
After the frequency changer is installed and the connection terminal is bolted, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
Through the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with some skill, it is possible to drop glue onto the opening and thus seal it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHm and with a small lamp, the drainage can be examined.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Then the B 100 – 6 OHm is connected and fastened with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the positive cable ( marked cable ) of the loudspeakers ( larger contact ) must be angled.
At the end, the bassreflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm ( the total length of the tube ) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening of the bass reflex tunnel should be preserved.
I can also give an order now and only start delivering in early June..
= Hallo to all.
Finally, they can announce that they will also organize the OSCAcast again this year.
Due to known reasons, it is not possible to have more than four people in the studio at the same time, which means a higher planning effort and the short notice of the announcement explains this.
There will be at least three people working on the switch, so that the Oscars 2021 will be broadcast with at least seven booms in the stream and hopefully thousands of viewers.
They do their best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it is still a pandemic - and they are doing their best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
Around 0:30, the race starts..
It's time to get the drinks cold, plan a good meal and make themselves ready for a long, but very interesting night.
