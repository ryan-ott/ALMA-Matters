The big return of the Czech smoker is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, returns to the NHL.
The 32- year old Plzeň native is on the bench and may soon be in the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvinov, Plzeň or Chinese Chelyabinsk suffered an injury in preparation for the NHL in October of last year.
Exactly in the middle of the game against Vegas, he was replaced and has not appeared on the ice in the NHL since then.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper passed from one set of goalposts to the other.
Pavel Francouz will be out of action for approximately three to four weeks with an injury to his lower body, Denver announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL lasted more than two months.
In the afternoon of Sunday American time, he was called from the farm where he caught four ducks and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he recorded 94.5 % of the catches.
A former Plzeň hockey player wants to finally prove that he belongs to the best league in the world..
In the last season he had problems with his knees and in the shortened pandemic season he did not play a single match.
In the NHL, "Francík " pitched 36 games, his success rate was 92.3 percent.
Charles wears a mask for his Christmas wish, William and Kate pose in Jordan.
The British prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish.
Prince Charles also announced his wishes,, using a photograph in which his wife Camille helps him to put on a mask.
On its website, the British news station BBC reported on this.
Wishes are sent to friends, colleagues and charities with which they collaborate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color and the dress also has Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same uniform as Prince George and Prince Louis, consisting of shorts and a shirt with a neckband.
The photographer who took the photo is not known, and neither William and Kate have stated when it was taken.
The royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas greeting on a pile of hay in front of a heap of wood in their country estate in the county of Norfolk.
The picture, which serves as a Christmas greeting, was also released by successor to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
The photographer Sam Hussein captured him in June at the Ascot races.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her colored mask that matches her white dress.
According to efotbal.CS, Slavia promised Berbrovi a million for the title, Tvrdik denied it.
In the current corruption case, the criminal investigators apparently worked with the idea that the former vice president of the Football Association of Croatia Roman Berbr had been promised a million Croatian kuna for the league title in the 2018-19 season.
According to efotbal.CZ, he obtained a part of the police records.
The president of the Vršovjak club, Jaroslav Tvrdik, said that the red and whites did not engage in any corrupt activities.
The server published recordings of police interrogations in which Slavia's former sports director, Jan Nezmar, featured prominently. Nezmar left the club in 2016.
The former influential functionary of the Communist Party was, according to the report, in frequent contact with both Berbrem and the former sports director of then second division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogozem,, who is also involved in the case.
Criminal investigators apparently worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi had promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the team of SK Slavia won the title in the first league.
The police organization had information that Roman ( Berbr ) from Slavia had been promised a million-aire bonus from the club' s board of directors.
A day later, according to the criminalists, Berbr met not only with Nezmare, but also with Slavia president Tvrdić.
According to the server, it is not clear whether the police are still investigating this information.
Tvrdik rejected any corrupt activity.
In the years 2015 to 2017, they actively tried to change the balance in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
They have never been involved in illegal activities, have not attempted to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and have not given any financial assistance to anyone in this connection. Tvrdik said for Seznam Zprávy.
In the broadcasts after the match, Nezmar, in an uncontrolled manner, ridiculed some of the former Slavia players with dark skin and also slandered his former boss Tvrdić.
The case of alleged manipulation of matches through referees began with a police raid on several locations, including the FAČR headquarters in mid- October 2014.
The most prominent figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football functions.
In mid- January, the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
The new guns are of a worse type ( the artillerymen have to fire from armored bunkers and carry ammunition by hand without protection )
The Toyoty hi-lux are new and good.
Tank and armored vehicles – on a decent level, the Pragy V3s have also been eliminated from the specialized units.
Aircraft - good, but at the end of their service life, in terms of transport, very small and with a short flight range, but modern.
Drones - they are small and only have a limited combat potential.
Rackets - they do not have any ( but they manufacture and export them to foreign countries )
PVO - medium - cold war and obsolete, short range - good, modern and relatively good numbers.
She has such a story.
The city of Honitbu is located right next to the city.
There were nutria in the rivers and they did damage to the crops, so he was sitting there.
When he arrived, he saw that on the other side of the river there was a fisherman.
He didn't want to make a mess, so he sat quietly and the guy didn't notice him.
He was hoping that he would leave before anything came out,, but after a few minutes, a fox appeared.
He allowed her to come to 40 metres before deciding to shoot.
The poor fisherman was nearly drowned, was beaten on all sides, and then called out to him that it was a liverwort.
Before he left the palace, he was drunk.
In other words, the grass must be green.
On the other side, it is not a war, it would have required a large number of coincidences for something to happen, and it is likely that he would have been seen on thermal imaging, which is used by almost everyone today.
In a visible place, expensive things are kept close to the feet in the sleeping bag, and he would have been in a good mood.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Nitro obtained respirators at a significantly lower price than the Ministry of Health.
The state responsible for the purchase and distribution of roušes, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus has spent millions of crowns on their production in recent weeks.
The radio station iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the amounts of respirators differed by hundreds of crowns on a single day.
The reason for the dramatic change in prices.
The offices that behaved economically.
And because other people bought them at a higher price.
Lenka Kabrhelová talks with Dominika Kubištova, a reporter for the iRozhlas radio station.
Soldiers and armies are respected ( but the younger generation is not affected by the memories of the former Soviet Army, and the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from compulsory military service.
They do not have large warehouses of modern equipment that could be used by the newly trained soldiers, they do not have modern equipment for the existing professionals, in addition, modern equipment is becoming increasingly difficult to use, so the capabilities of reservists are rapidly decreasing in time.
In addition to the modern conventional conflicts,, which can be fought by anyone,, are taking place very quickly and there is no time to retrain anyone again.
And finally, the reserves and territorial defense are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrilla warfare is carried out and it is also a necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight only takes place in a conflict of this magnitude and intensity, where guerrilla warfare is irrelevant and there is no suitable geography for it.
The main problem is that they lack individual skills.
It is not the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it..
In such a situation, a player who missed an empty goal 2 minutes earlier rushes into the attack by himself between 2 or even 3 Swiss players and says, " I'll get a goal and that's what is going to happen. "
However, it is not uncommon for him to be a member of the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill " to provoke the defender " is so terrible that he has been genuinely surprised when he saw that the team's attacker was able to overtake one player from the opposing team.
The first swallows.
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but no major change is expected in the following weeks.
The pressure on hospitals according to statistical models is expected to continue for some time and, as is known, the new, unknown variant Omicron, which spreads much faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty that it can cause a more serious course, to the extent that it is helped by vaccination or post-- infection immunity gained from previous infection.
However, this week, the covid equation also included an unexpected phenomenon on the side of the pluses: the possibility of healing.
A new antiviral drug, molnupiravir, arrived in Czechia, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and hospitalization by a third, and it is possible to treat it at home.
Pfizer's new antibiotic, paxlovid, was expected to be added to the arsenal soon, with a success rate of 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to Czechia, in addition to the hope of expanding the arsenal of useful tools in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the administration is prepared for the arrival of new drugs.
It was said that the first batch of molnupiravir would be sent to domestic patients from the Merck company.
The company ended up on the sidelines first and foremost because it started developing the drug long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for viral diseases affecting horses in the South American continent.
In this research, it is often overlooked that people in the West ( Germany and Sweden, etc. )
They are generally less open and less willing to share their opinions..
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially the Czechs, are accustomed to speaking " as their beaks grew.
He did a study where people were asked whether they liked Muslims.
In Czech, the vast majority of people say that they do not.
In the West, they say that they love migration, that everyone should help them and that the Czechs are racist hovads.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their job and being subjected to media lynching.
In the surveys, it looks good in the west and bad in the east.
But he finds out what people really think..
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour have more than 20 % according to a survey.
It is known that the objects are three and completely identical.
This is due to the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers would not have to relearn where everything is, so all the buildings are identical.
One is the Atom Muzeum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
It is strange that the Soviet Union did not want to have nuclear heads on its own territory for reasons of safety or speed of deployment due to its more western position.
In the underground bunkers ( there are two in each yew tree ) only the heads of the missiles were stored,, not the entire missiles.
In order to deploy this weapon, a special unit was sent, which lifted the head and attached it to some kind of carrying device.
In addition to the museum's oak trees, those remaining in a desolated state.
At the second grade of the elementary school, they had a classmate Cigána, for 4 years.
He was in a good mood, made good jokes and often went over the top, but he was the team's mascot.
He talked to him every day, he often went to him and wanted to explain something, he lacked nothing, he went to him regularly, he devoted himself to sports with them and he didn't steal rations or telephones. he was cleanly dressed.
He also went on camping trips and did various animal exhibitions, but he was always in a good mood and never made any mistakes.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings and gypsies entered the same year and other classes.
Shortly afterwards, they beat the teacher, the police often intervened, they threatened and intimidated other students.
Personally, he sometimes sells something on an advertisement ( old things, things he does not need, etc. ) and he has often sold Cigans for money, they did not try to take advantage of him and the conversation was calm.
He even sold a car to a boy who called him a month later to say that he had rewritten the contract.
As for himself, he says that he is not a racist and that he does not care whether the person is white, black, yellow or other, as long as he behaves in a decent society ( works, functions and women do not beat ) .
As soon as someone comes, stretches out his arm, steals apartments and houses, has around him nothing but chaos and creates problems. but it doesn't matter whether he is black or white.
He does not have a problem with African migrants, if they stay in the country and begin to work, learn the language ( not necessarily, at least the English language ) and respect the country's culture.
As long as they respect his traditions and culture, he will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in the Prachatick region.
The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts, died at the scene, according to Právu's spokeswoman, Zuzana Fajtlov.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl..
The 18--year old driver of the Peugeot vehicles was probably travelling in the direction of the village of Žichovec to the village of Bavorov, and he lost control of his vehicle in a turn in the opposite direction.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on the roof of a building outside the road, described the accident by police spokeswoman Stéphanie Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It was a multiple injury and he was trapped in the vehicle.
After he was freed, he had to be given emergency pre-- hospital care and he was transported by air to the hospital in Budějovic, in a stable condition. The rescuer Fajtlov said.
The man in the second vehicle suffered a minor injury to his chest and was taken to the hospital.
For baggage from countries outside the EU, new rules have been introduced and passengers often fail to provide details.
Lukas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month..
He mainly collects collector's cards.
" Normally, it is a few dollars, for example, up to ten dollars, where it is still profitable to import from Japan,, where the post is often free. " approximates the collector.
Since October, the cost of delivering small parcels has increased slightly, they must now add DPH and postage and submit information for customs control.
He receives a letter from customs saying that they expect the package to arrive.
It is necessary to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the DPH was not included in the initial sale, the customs authority will calculate it from the total amount of the shipment and the transport.
In the event that the recipient does not take care of the customs procedures himself, he must also add to the total amount the freightage of the carrier.
According to Lukáše Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
He presses one or two trigger buttons, attaches two inserts, and is done..
For him, it is usually a matter of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
Not all deliveries go smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of international shipments received at the international post office in Prague fell from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests to provide information necessary for the completion of customs procedures..
At the moment, there are 30,000 parcels waiting to be processed at the international post office.
If people filled in all the necessary details and did so in time, they would have been roughly halfway through by the end of the day, according to Czech Post spokesperson Matyas Vitik.
Solving inflation
As the title suggests, they proposed a solution to the current inflation.
Currently, the inflation rate is 9.9 percent and it is expected to rise.
What they want the state to do in order to slow down or compensate for this growth.
For example, the reduction of DPH on food and fuel in Poland, this is the way.
What is expected to happen, what is inevitable, where it is heading.
Wages rise more slowly than prices, according to him, it is unavoidable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How many have been added to the payroll ( who is an employee )
His salary was increased by 2 percent, this is a disgrace,, but fortunately he has a similar income from his business..
It is not possible to explain why those who have been proven to be violent criminals are sentenced to only 6 months in prison..
It's unbelievable to me that a court can sentence such a beast to six months in jail only because it has done it or done it again. as soon as it gets out of jail.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that its victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting its sexual relationships and relationships in general.
And the victim of rape may never recover from that. as well..
This does not apply to potential future victims of sexual assault.
The man from Hrobo " shot " his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The man from Hrobo accidentally helped the guards to detain his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was issued a warrant to arrest her.
He himself called her to him.
However, he took a detour..
He first approached a passerby and invented a story that he had been robbed.
The guards arrived at the scene after being called in on the emergency line and were stunned when the alleged " robbed " told them that he made up the story to get the guards to come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the guards on how to report to the Police of the Republic of Croatia.
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the guards discovered that the woman is on the list of wanted persons and is the subject of a nationwide manhunt.
The case is being investigated by the police.
An honest question for the people there, who consider their country to be Slavic.
Personally, he is of the opinion that the Slavs have been ethnically and culturally different for a long time, and he is interested in the opinion of others.
Jinak with memem, he also agrees that it is a shame that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague.
However, they do not deny that they have a Slavic language.
I don't know whether it is possible for a rational person to believe something completely without evidence, just because it could potentially bring benefits.
This is not a case of genuine faith..
Together with Pascalem, it is impossible to agree on the existence of approximately 10,000 different religions in the world.
Whose god or gods a person then chooses.
He said that it is likely that in some of the thousands of religions, there is at least one god who punishes them severely if they believe in another god.
However, in the 10th century, it was stated that there is no other god other than the god of Jahve.
In this case, it would have been more rational to avoid believing in any god, rather than risking being sent to hell or some other similar place by the one true god he had missed..
Others - voluntary training and subsequent placement in the reserve.
The Swiss model is probably similar.
Six months of training ( in different specializations, six months in one ) and under the command of professional officers with practical experience.
If a person does well, he may be offered a professional contract.
All the units of the AČR would benefit from something like this.
This could have been done in cooperation with the Military University.
They can talk like this: The cooperation between the educational sector and the industry is constantly on the rise, the companies are recruiting from the schools and there is a kind of intermingling when the workforce migrates from the educational institutions to the workplace.
Not only during adolescence,, but this process is constantly going on, everyone is constantly learning new things and moving from one field to another.
A similar cross--ector between civilian and military sectors.
He also sees it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, which ensures that they will never be invaded by Russians, Germans or even Mongolian invaders.
It is amusing that they consider NATO to be something carved in stone, they have allies and these will defend them if things go wrong.
It's not a pleasure for the boss.
Just one election in the United States that destroys their budget and the entire NATO goes into the pit.
The English exchange them for Russian money, the Germans exchange them for Russian gas and the Poles have already once shown that they are willing to show their backs and take what they want.
The only long--lasting guarantee of independence is an army armed to the teeth and a population that can operate the weapons of its time.
Today, every teenager is able to pilot remotely controlled devices., so this was not possible.
They don't need the border fortifications, they are obsolete now, but the armed teenager under the control of a remote--controlled device can handle it.
As the krabicovic tsunami engulfs them.
They open the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly find themselves surrounded by boxes and fillings.
This " waste " is used again by e--shops, which lack packaging materials.
This was done in order to map the trade routes used by their used cigarette boxes.
It's not just for Christmas..
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a waste to treat them as one--time waste.
Anyone can bring to the participating shop ( there are nearly 150 of them in the Kamsnim.CZ map ) a cardboard box, a plastic or paper filling.
Tím supports small firms, reduces the amount of waste produced and avoids overcrowded blue containers.
The individual businesses welcome the shortage of packaging and the saved money, because packaging cardboard has increased in price by 50 % over the last period.
For the eyes of ecologically minded consumers, this also strengthens its brand.
One of these businesses is Tierra Verde, a manufacturer of ecological drugs and ecological cosmetics.
Cases and filler material are transported to Popůve by individuals, who have accumulated them at home,, but also by firms with whom they have agreed on regular deliveries of discarded cardboard..
All of these are used in the packing of goods from the company's shop.
Thanks to individuals and firms working together, the world has become more respectful.
Their wish is to preserve the sources and beauty of nature for future generations, according to Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The Kamsnim website, however, shows not only the places of distribution of packaging materials..
It serves as a searcher, when it is necessary to dispose of something ( when it is necessary to get rid of waste from the household, when it is necessary to dispose of expired medicines, tyres, outdated electrical equipment and large amounts of waste, etc. ).
All waste ends up in the right place, and recyclable items find a second home..
The total map of the project includes more than 100,000 such locations..
"Over time, they were joined by collection yards, recycling centers, textile and food banks, charitable shops and other places that help to find use for things that would otherwise become waste,, according to Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
In the present day, technology is so simple and stupid that children who use computers or telephones to play games do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem ( mainly in English articles ) has emerged that students at high schools do not understand the principle of components on computers.
Because, for example, Google's pictures or Apple's pictures or, in general, mobile telephones hide the underlying filesystem with components and put everything on one screen in the application.
It is possible to use the technique from childhood,, but mainly to learn something.
They are rewriting history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron announced his priorities for the French presidency of the EU, which begins in January,, and it was grandiose.
Macron spoke for more than an hour, during which he revealed the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans, in the workplace and on the streets, and mentioned so many activities that it would not be possible to complete them in half a year.
However, French politicians like it, and it is liked by voters.
Macron's supporters are divided between the right and the left, but they are united on the issue of Europe.
In France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and that France is prepared to create conditions for such work.
A number of commentators immediately jumped in to criticize Macron for his pro--European propaganda and for rewriting history.
In actuality, it is trying to rewrite history.
The right--wing candidate for the French presidency, Eric Zemmour is currently touring France with his thesis that the regime of Vichy, which collaborated with Hitler during the Second World War, was not as bad, and has had some success with this among the French.
Taking Macron's idea of one history lesson seriously and ignoring what is happening in France.
It was not necessary.
Students in European countries are often taught history as a story of the oppressed versus the oppressors and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French and the Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
However, if they do not have an enlightened conductor, they do not know the wider context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida.
The Czech " Mice " did not win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenici in 1995, also won awards for best director and best actress, Jasna Duricic.
At the 2018 Karlovac Film Festival, it was the most watched film.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Otec.
He is not very young, he is not very healthy and he is not vaccinated.
It was like having chickenpox or being unwell. for a few days he had diarrhea and didn't feel like smoking.
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
With chickenpox, he does not have diarrhea.
(Only personal experience. he does not claim that this is the case for everyone)

Trains begin to run according to the new schedule, in some places the carriers change.
From Sunday onwards, trains began to operate according to a new timetable..
The biggest change is the replacement of the transport companies on some routes, such as between Ústím nad Labem and Kolin, where instead of Czech Railways, RegioJet begins to operate.
In most lines, only the departure time is changed,, and sometimes the route is slightly altered.
There are also hundreds of new trains on the tracks..
The transport companies started selling tickets during the autumn..
Czeche Railways plan to operate 6,783 passenger trains per day on average, of which 478 are long- distance trains.
Trains travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
Alongside the domestic connections, the new flight schedules also include flights to Germany, Poland, to Slovakia, to Hungary, to Austria and to Switzerland.
The company, together with the new timetable, introduces hundreds of new trains.
The main innovation is the Interjet flights, which fly from Prague to Cheb.
More new trains will be deployed in northern Moravia or western Bohemia..
The transport company also increased the price of the ticket by 3.2 percent from the next year.
The railways take into account inflation in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJetu schedule is the introduction of line R23 from Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolin.
The airline is replacing Czech Railways after success in the Ministry of Transport's competition..
Every day, RegioJet operates a total of 16 routes, eight in each direction.
Other changes include the addition of stops in the cities of Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolin.
Leo Express kept its 16 routes, two return flights to Slovakia and also weekend flights to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the transport company tried to maintain as similar as possible the flight times of its long--distance flights despite the planned stoppages.
With few changes, the operation of Arrivy and other carriers would continue.
There are also changes in some regional routes.
For example, passengers on the line from Mladé Boleslavi via Českolipski to Rumburak are served by Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn..
Passengers will also be able to use the unified fare on the railways for the second year..
Similarly, the price of their tickets increased by 3.2 percent due to inflation.
I don't agree.
It's hard to see the other side of the coin.
Everywhere, they heard that they had to fight hard for their rights, that they were oppressed and had to work hard and die.
In life, he has never heard a lecture from the point of view of the slaveholders or from that time, no one defends it or condemns it.
Nobody tells this in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one is taught in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they say that the Europeans brutally killed them, but they were killing each other long before.
For a while, he also spent time in the United States, at schools directly, in northern schools and in southern ones.
He has never encountered a deliberate attempt to conceal facts, but he has heard that this has happened and that it is a problem, which he does not deny ( for example, in Japan, the atrocities of World War II are relatively taboo ).
His main point was that history is not black and white and that people tend to view it from the perspective of today, without understanding.
History is not interested in people's feelings, it is as it is, and he thinks that it is a fatal mistake to condemn people without looking at the circumstances of the time.
On the other side, they should learn from it and never do it again.
When it comes to the southern states,, the confederate flag and the slave owners are quite popular there,, but they also had some of their own successes and it is absurd to condemn them.
In addition, the North was not as good as many people idealize it today.
A lot of people also forget that not all people in the South were slave owners and that they were also opposed to many things.
This is not comparable with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, they lie and manipulate, in addition, there was a video from television where someone started to talk about the legionnaires and 1968.
One of the things that surprised him about American schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that never occurred in his country.
In general, it was felt that at some of the universities, the students were radicalized and the schools supported them.
When he imagines that these people will be much older, he is not happy about the possibility that this could be the voice of the majority, because there are also young people among them and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long ago achieved what it had set out to do, and it is no longer the same. it has become radicalized.
At present, those who call themselves feminists are those who ignore the basic biological fact and ignore other groups such as LGBT, which leads to radicalization on the opposite side, and this often leads to opposition to quite reasonable things.
The more radical someone is,, the more he is heard.
On the other hand, he has never been accused of colonialism or slavery.
More often than not, he had bad geography,, but it was a two--way thing.
It was not because he didn't like it, but because he thought it was unreasonable.
He should be proud of something that he was not able to achieve on his own.
In addition, the concept of nationality as a whole is considered unnecessary from the point of view of some personal identity.
If one is connected to people by interests, views on the world and shared experiences, rather than the place where they were born.
He is not a believer, but from what he knows, he can say that there are two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovakian.
This Slovakian priest is a really good guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but he always talks about the coronavirus and how everyone is afraid of it.
And there is also the Czechoslovak Church of the Bohemian Brethren.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they emerged from Catholic modernism and are in fact Catholic without a pope.
He knows many people who are Catholics but go to church with the Hussites because it is theologically similar, but the members are more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on the street Botanica.

Břeclav – Plamínek lit by fire in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The Scouts did not go to Vienna for the second time because of the pandemic of the coronavirus. they were handed over by their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing of Reintal – Břeclav in the morning..
At the border, they handed it over last year as well.
The Betlém light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that the company participates in every year and enjoys it immensely.
It is an honor for her that she was chosen, she said to the present reporters, scout Amalie Budikow.
In contrast to the previous year, the handover took place at the border crossing of Mikulov- Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge,, but now at the border crossing of Reintal – Břeclav on the parking grounds.
Normally, the scouts travel by train to Vienna.
There is no change in the distribution of the flame across the Czech Republic.
With the blessing of the Bethlehem light, scouts traditionally traveled by train first to Brno, where they handed it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle..
On the subsequent distribution of light, on Saturday 18th December, the Scout couriers would travel on selected fast trains and passenger trains.
From them, the light is picked up by the local scouts or volunteers, who then spread the flames across the country and even to places where the railway does not reach..
This year, scouts must obey the valid measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It is similar to last year.
They are giving advice to the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear masks, try to maintain a safe distance, not sing to each other and behave in such a way that it is the safest. described the spokesperson of the event, the Bethlehem light Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the pilgrimage of the Betlém light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The purpose is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time with the flame.
The Betlém light is a symbol of hope and light that overcomes darkness for believers.
In Czechia, Scouts and Scoutettes have been spreading it for more than 30 years..
The action is carried out by thousands of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of non--partisanship and human solidarity.
All the news, including the list of places where people can come to take care of the baby,, can be found on the websites of "Birth of the Light".

Television follows the trend of Christmas films and premiered two hundred of them this year.
Los Angeles - television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English- speaking countries fell into the trend of Christmas films and in 2019 they presented a record number of more than 200 premieres.
Spočítal calculated the film database IMDb's operator.
In recent years, the genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been popular with the audience and has significantly increased the viewership. as a result, more and more of these films have been produced.
In 2012, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice more than in 2007.
The IMDb database, on the other hand, included only those films with the word Christmas ( Vánoce ) in their titles,, so the actual number of Christmas films is much higher.
The films traditionally associated with Christmas have existed since time immemorial.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated especially with fairy tales, and worldwide, films such as Home Alone, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and the classic Christmas film It's a Wonderful Life from 1946 are popular.
However, the boom of Christmas films did not start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark launched a special film series, as reported by the BBC.
Her advent project, Countdown to Christmas ( Countdown to Christmas ) at the time included four films and was very successful.
In 2013, this station began its viewers to tune in for Christmas on 22 October and presented a total of 42 Christmas films.
The competing station Lifetime has 35 new films with a Christmas theme on its programme this year, as well as popular streaming platforms such as Netflix.
"In this magical period, the story is not as important as the fact that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it is snowing. " Brandon Gray, author of the book on Christmas films called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I will be home for Christmas films).
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to at least for two hours to feel a little bit of calm amidst all of this festive madness and the madness of the world in which they have lived for the last few years,, he added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark Television uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
There are two people who fall in love with each other,, but there is a misunderstanding between them that lasts about half an hour before the end of the film, which is eventually resolved and they kiss.
It's like this all the time, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people watch them one after the other, adds Gray.

California restricts the sale of firearms.
He wants to follow the path of Texas with regard to the prohibition of abortion.
Governor of California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons using the legal mechanism used by Texas' controversial abortion law after detecting the heartbeat of an embryo.
People would then be entitled to compensation in lawsuits against anyone in California who manufactures or sells assault weapons and homemade firearms.
Oznama Newsoma reacted to the Friday decision of the American Supreme Court, which upheld the Texas ban on abortion, although it went against nearly 50 years of precedent which established the right to abortion throughout the United States up to 24 weeks of pregnancy.
However, the court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on technical issues that arise from the innovative construction of the regulation..
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, thus preventing the usual court route.
" He was outraged by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States to allow Texas to maintain its ban on most abortion services and to a large extent support the maneuver of Texas to protect its law. "
"If now, states can block the review of their laws by federal courts, California is using this privilege to protect human lives. "
His subordinates were instructed to work together with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice to draft a decree that would allow representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so--called ghost weapons.
These weapons, made at home, which do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations are referred to as such.
Newsom wants to give citizens the right to demand compensation of at least 10,000 dollars (220,000 Kč) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault weapons in California.
"The most effective way to keep these dreadful weapons out of the streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, and that's exactly what they should do. "
The Associated Press reports that California, after a decade, banned the production and sale of certain military- style weapons, but a federal judge in June overturned the ban as unconstitutional.
If, in fact, the ban on the use of Texas templates was reinstated, the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor, who in her dissenting opinion warned against the expansion of this legal mechanism to other American states were confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court of Texas's ban on abortion did not allow complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against selected officials of the southern state of the United States.

Poland threatened to stop paying into the EU budget.
According to Ziobra, the European Commission acted in violation of the law when it used its new powers and because of the dispute over the legal state, it suspended the payment of money to Poland.
The Commission has already postponed approval of the Polish plan to use 36 million euros from the EU reconstruction fund affected by the pandemic of 1999.
A is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use the mechanism allowing it to withdraw EU funding from countries violating the principles of a legal state.
"Poland should respond to this intimidation from the EU's veto in all matters that require unanimity, " said Ziobro, head of the small party Solidarity of Poland, without which the current government would have lost a tight majority in the Sejm.
"Poland also needs to reconsider its commitments to the European Union's energy and climate policies, which have led to a dramatic increase in energy prices. "
If the dispute continues, he would demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It is unacceptable because the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, which it also contributes to, added the Polish minister.
His party's approach to the EU is more radical than that of the governing party Právo and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that took place in Polish justice during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, is building " impossible conditions " because its goal is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland.
Warsaw is facing " political dictatorship imposed by blackmail and attempts to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles " according to Ziobro.
He said that Poland should be a member of a European Union based on partnership between sovereign states and not on the rule of the most powerful and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels, the consequences of which would have been the reduction of Poland's sovereignty.
"We would never accept that Poland would become a colony. "

For two years, they have been observing how the data is treated as fertilizer, most of the opponents of the vaccination are only slightly more outside the norm than the majority of the supporters of the vaccination.

As a child, he was punished with a spoon.
It was never because of the marks, it was usually because she refused to listen and was a troublemaker ( she read instead of going to bed, fought with her brothers and so on ).
At the same time, she has never been punished without warning, she has always been warned first that if she did it again, she would be hit ( sometimes even after a second " slap " with a cooking utensil that was only brought and placed so that she could see it.
Only after repeatedly refusing to listen, he received a number of blows to his buttocks.
Personally, he thinks that physical punishment ( in a reasonable manner and degree ) is beneficial, because the child reacts much more to it than to words.
The most important part is the part with the warning, because it gives the child a choice as to whether to disobey and be punished, or to obey and avoid punishment.
In the end, he usually only needed to warn her to start listening..

When the prominent Czech lawyer and Constitutional Court judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999, he said that the Constitution is a sacred document on which oaths are sworn and which is taught in schools from an early age,, or on the other hand, a treaty that can be changed in case of need.
Once they agreed on the democratic rules of their life, which at the same time define who they are as a state and its citizens, and with changes are better off.
For example, some nations have their own customs, traditions.
In the same way, the Czechs like the knedlíky with pork and cabbage, commented on the issue by Vojtěch Cepl at the time..
However, in recent years, the opinion that the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia needs to be changed has become more common among legal experts..
Leta is tested by situations that its creators ( including Vojtěch Cepl ) could not foresee, such as the behaviour of the directly elected president.
However, in one case, Cepl was right.
All that is known about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be carefully planned..
The institute must be understood and actively defended, only then it can be the key to managing most of the crises that plague societies across history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a sort of order of government consisting of individual rules that define the boundaries within which politicians play their games.
They are afraid that the power will be misused against minorities or individuals, so politicians impose prohibitions.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Cervical cancer does not discriminate, in the FN in Brno, several months old babies are fighting for their lives.
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder on children, there are also cases of severe illness,, especially in recent years.
" They know that children are endangered and affected less than adults, they say that 2 to 5 percent of children are affected compared to adults. " said the head of the Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, Petr Dominik.
The course of the disease is usually much easier, lighter and often without symptoms.
However, there are also children who are seriously ill with the coronavirus,, especially in the last period,, he added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are about 100 children who need moderate care.
It takes place in the children's infectious diseases clinic.
Very seriously ill children with the coronavirus are being admitted to the ARU in the last few weeks.
Children with post---Covid syndromes were on the ward continuously throughout the year according to the doctor.
"There is an increase in the number of children with acute cases of pneumonia, which means that they are suffering from pneumonia that requires staying on a resuscitation bed, and that this disease affects both adults and adolescents, as well as several months old babies. "
In the hospitals, there are also children in a serious condition due to the coronavirus.
"In the present time, there are children of several months and adolescent age in the hospital., " said the head of the hospital.
However, he is happy that in the children's hospital of the FN Brno, there have been no deaths of children from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominika, the presence of a psychologist in the children's hospital is an essential part of the cooperation between the psychologist and the hospital.
At the same time, he also points out the fact that, as with adults,, the vaccination also mitigates the course of the disease and also reduces the occurrence of post--viral syndrome.
" In addition, the application of inoculation doses is also recommended for children,, " the doctor added.

Sinologist Jirouš says that China is building the impression that it is able to handle the epidemic and that the authoritarian regime is coping with the crisis better.
China launched medical and political offensives.

Now, the countries report zero new cases of infected.

He takes an example from another comment " Spanish orange and mandarin " where it is clear that both are from Spain, while in " Spanish fruit and mandarin " it is not clear that the mandarines are from Spain.
In addition, the verse says " all American forces " which includes their weapons and that he knows that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, it is understood that it is included in the broad term and is not necessary to specify it further among the American forces.
And again,, perhaps just a word or two :D

Vicki Holland from Britain mistreated orangutan kosmana Milly.
Disturbing footage shows the moment when the terrified monkey crouched in the toilet bowl, before its cruel owner killed it and mocked it.
Hollandová also fed the orangutans with sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The magistrate's court in Gwent has now banned her from keeping animals for life, reported the newspaper The Sun.
The experts in rehabilitation of orangutans, who care for Milly after her abuse, said that they had never seen an orangutan in such a state.
Ms. Milly spent nearly two years of rehabilitation with the staff of Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued orangutan named Moon.
The four- times mother admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to protected animals.
At the magistrate's court in Gwent, she was sentenced to 120 days in custody with a conditional release for one year.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on keeping animals and was ordered to pay 12,000 korun in court costs.
Leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer said "Milly is in good condition but the rehabilitation process is still ongoing. "
It took Milly a long time to get used to people again..
Krcila and hid herself from everyone she met and from any loud noise or sudden movement that made her scream.
Opička refused to eat for a long time.
Now, when she has settled down and is happy with the male,, she may still be frightened by the sight of new people.
The psychological scars from the abuse will haunt her for the rest of her life, Sawyer says.
The abuse of Milly was revealed after police in Gwent found disturbing footage in the woman's phone after a raid on her home following accusations of drug use.
In the footage, it can be heard that Milly vulgarly abuses.
On the second video, it is heard that Holland's monkey offers cocaine and says " I want cocaine. "
She licked his fingers..
In May, together with his partner Russell Cox (43), he admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, she was found with 1600 pounds of cocaine hidden in Kinder Eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.

As for standing in front of the machines, the note that one does not need any of this at all was taken quite seriously., because it is not needed at all.
In addition, they are slowly entering the era when ignorance is a sign of punk.

If journalists were able to calculate, it is possible that the covid never reached these dimensions..
The wedding on the first sight continues. the war between Kadriho and Andrey continues.
This is the main reason why it is not possible for Switzerland to leave at once,, replied Andrea on Instagram in her stories to all the inquisitive fans who were disappointed with her performance at Kadirim and decided to terminate all contact and even block her on social media.
The relationship between Kadrim and Andreou was strained from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that, at least until he returns to Croatia permanently,, his wife Andrea would stay with him.
However, she resolutely rejected it.
And as seen, their relationship did not only end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred..
It was a planned attack by Kadri in response to Andreino's accusation of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadriho's apparent honesty was not liked by even his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
Normally, they don't talk about such things and in the family they never talked about them much.
He does not want to provoke any sympathy.
But when he sees someone who tries to publicly discredit and tarnish the reputation of someone whom he loves so much, he can't tolerate it.
It's a pity that she had to go this way, but she wanted to publicly thank her brother Kadrimu for the fact that he made himself into a character and helped his family when they needed him the most, in spite of his young age.
It is more painful for him to have to read such misleading information, which is likely to have been taken out of context..
Hrozně bych all wanted to know Kadriho as well as I, his close friends and family, stood in solidarity in response to the words of Andrey.
I'm really grateful to him.
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that his family loves him and knows the truth and knows what really happened..
The drunken thief climbed up the façade to the fifth floor.
It's hard to believe that it is because of this..
Cchao began his robbery raid on the parking grounds in the residential quarters, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, a total of 330 korun was taken from one of the vehicles.
He then climbed to the fifth floor and jumped through the open window into the apartment.
Tam stole two bananas.
On one of the security cameras, he is seen leaving the scene of the crime and eating a banana at the same time..
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning and discovered that the bananas were not where they were,, he called the police.
Then Cchaa was detained.
The man admitted that he drank alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, in a state of drunkenness, he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk man climbed up the façade to the fifth floor, stole two bananas.

On the first glance, it is not complicated.
The vast majority of surnames in Czech represent only one grammatical gender, and it is not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neutral.
On the other hand, there is also a relatively large group of substantive names where the gender is not fixed..
Substantive words oscillate between the two genera.
When pronounced, they acquire double consonants and in some cases remain in the unstressed form.
For example, the words " swivel " and " kyxel " are both masculine and feminine, in the first, they are pronounced according to the model " machine " and in the second according to the model " song.
The other group of substantives have different forms in the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of the first syllable of
Both forms are official and have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally,, for example, " okurka " in Čechia and " okurek " in Moravia, in this case, however, the Moravian variant is not written. Similarly, there are other Czech- Moravian pairs of words, " prikop " and " prikopa " , " kobliha " and " koblih " , for example.
Some words, which have entered the Czech language from other languages, were originally unaccented,, but have gradually acquired Czech endings.
A typical example is the word " image " which is both masculine and feminine, or the word " buffet " which has remained in the middle gender and has endings that resemble " castle ".

Lenka Kabrhelová talks with journalist Ikou Detrich from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are very rare.
Therefore, the word is always written everywhere.
For people, it is uncomfortable to talk about how sexual violence is prevalent in their society and how widespread it is,, so they try to cover it up.
He has not personally known anyone who was falsely accused.
He knows a lot of people who have been raped and he has witnessed how the people around them or the police often behave towards them.
The victims must always believe.
The trend has become that the victims finally open up about their traumas.
However, it is still the case that too many people keep it for themselves.
There are also those who falsely accuse others..
It is a disgusting and dissemination of the idea that " a large part of the accusations are fabricated " and that it is a " trend " that helps only sexually violent perpetrators.
Czechia is flooded with unfinished houses and families do not have enough money to complete them.
The prices of building materials have increased by more than 30 percent in the last few weeks and months.
A number of people were in a difficult situation because of this.
It does not have the funds to complete the unfinished family houses and the banks have refused to increase the hypothecial loans.
In addition to the increase in the cost of materials, there is also an increase in the cost of construction work.
As a result, people do not have enough money to finish the construction of their family homes.
In many cases, the banks refuse to increase the hypothecial loan, which creates extremely uncomfortable situations.
In the better case, people move into unfinished and unlicensed houses.
In the worst case, the houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay off the hypotecas and to pay rent as well.
They build two to three family houses a year, and in 50 percent of the cases, they succeed.
For the construction company, it is difficult because they have to comply with certain things in the contract, even though the materials have become more expensive.
Therefore, they work without wages " said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are only just starting to have financial problems.
If they had anticipated that it would cost five million to build the house, now it will cost seven million.
He said that some people would be disappointed.
The most expensive material was copper, iron and also the equipment used by carpenters and blacksmiths.
Construction firms also struggle with a lack of workers.
In Czech there is a shortage of graduates in the construction sector and the influx of foreign workers slows down the pandemic.
However, the situation is more favorable with regard to the issuance of building permits.
"The construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits in October, which is nearly 10 percent more than the previous year,, " Křeček clarified.

In contrast to these projects, there are known people who pay someone to do the semester project ( they did it many times, it was really beneficial and they learned a lot ) and then only do the project and have nothing to do.

I agree, despite the fact that Insta kicks artists under their feet.
As soon as every day he does not publish stories and at least every second day he publishes a new image, his reach decreases to a minimum.
In addition, Navic is constantly changing what is more important, whether it is a like, a comment or an upload.
I've been really fed up with it in the last few months, so he may have to cut back on TikTok, where many artists from his genre are doing well and don't want to give up on it.
In the end, I would have been happy if something more user--friendly came along,, one that does not extract all the creativity and energy from artists.

The Union – yes, against the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the opposition to the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Thirty years after the illegal dissolution of the Soviet Union.
On December 8, 1991, the biggest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of humanity took place.
On 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevič, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the 17 March 1991 referendum, secretly and without regard to the people, signed an agreement that " the Soviet Union as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceased to exist.
One stroke of the pen " abolished " the huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
The disintegration of the Soviet Union resulted in tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens living abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the population of the former Soviet republics, they have already lost more people than in both World War I and World War II combined.
The same people who destroyed what was built during the previous 70 years, betrayed the socialist camp ( created by sacrificing millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War.
Vědome deindustrialized the country, slowed down agriculture, detached the fourteen republics that were previously economically united in a single mechanism.
If they want to look deeper, they see the depopulation of the population, the collapse of the economy, science and the armies, the rise in criminality, ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-- Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO's expansion to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring and the war in Syria - all of which are the result of geopolitical capitulation, first to the socialist camp and then to the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as " power vacuum "
All that was left in a hurry was lost and abandoned, quickly filled and conquered by the territories of NATO that accepted the geopolitical capitulation of the Soviets..

In an alternative reality, in which he does not buy meat on Monday, it is reduced to 99 Kč / kg on Tuesday, he describes the mechanism by which the meat's price changes and becomes a threat to his eating system.
A or he could wait until Thursday, when the meat would be 1 day before its use was reduced to 69 Kč / kg, which was 120 Kč more than the meat he bought on Monday and left in his refrigerator for 3 days.

Theses kecs about the fact that when something is cheap, it must be bad, rotten or of poor quality are so ridiculous that it is hard to say the truth.
A few days ago, he went to Brno to Hlavas and in the underpass, the girls handed out some brochures, similar things that he always picks up to help the brigadiers, they cannot throw them away.
The pamphlet was full of peasant wisdom and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but there was no mention of God. He was bewildered but suspected that it was some sort of propaganda.
After reading it, he found out who published it,, and eventually, from it came Scientology.
However, he was a good mate, full of useless advice, telling him to clean up and not to be a peacemaker.

He was one of the recruits, he tried to do it ( he was 20 years old and a first- year student at the university, the initial promises of professional training and business skills quickly turned into " it doesn't interest them, they recruited a lot of people. "

Investment life insurance and real estate were the only sources of income,, which made the person feel like a street hawker.
However, the experience was valuable, the person learned that he should not jump on every speck of dust and thoroughly investigate the information.

Corporate events are also not mandatory.
They are also somewhat unique within their own company in that they are more corporate.

Czech missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, the British police unsuccessfully searched for the missing 32--year old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradištska had died.
The British police confirmed today in the afternoon that they found the body of the missing Czech citizen at their embassy in London.
The cause of death is being investigated.
As a result of the family's decision not to disclose more information about the case.
Sincere sorrow, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The last time the young woman was seen alive was on 28 November in a bus on the way to work, before she left to pick up money from a bank.
Her disappearance was announced by her colleagues five days later..
After this, the London police began to investigate, and Interpol placed her on the list of missing persons throughout the world.
It also appeared in the Czech missing persons database.
The police have already detained one man in connection with the case for several days..
In the case, Jakou played a major role and is suspected of having played a major role, but did not reveal it.

This is the biggest problem with the whole pandemic..
It took a while for him to adjust to the fact that he had contracted a highly contagious disease,, but it went smoothly.
The fact that a large part of the population, in all its layers, behaves in an idiotic way in this regard has been a problem for him for a long time..
He is most looking forward to the vaccination ( tomorrow ) because thanks to it, he will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not scumbags.
He was stripped of his presidency and his ability to regain it.
However, the chances of this actually happening are very small.
In addition, he is not sure whether the fact that the files were declassified in the first place made them worthy of being classified as a state secret.
Velezrada is an act of the president of the republic that threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
The number of people under 35 years old who are without sex for a year has increased.
More and more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
The main focus is on the religiously inclined people,, according to the Daily Mail's website.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of people under 35 years of age who abstained from sexual activity increased from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who stated that they had not had sexual intercourse in the last year were more than ever before.
The decline in the number of sexually active individuals is also influenced by other factors, revealed by a survey of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher percentage of unemployment.
The presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less important for young people, also contributed..
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they had no sex in the previous year has grown rapidly,, said researcher Lyman Stone of the IFS.
In married couples, sexual activity is more frequent, in 2021 only 5 % of them said that they had been without sex for the last year.
Among the free people, it was 29 % and Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also due to fear of premarital sex and religious affiliation.
However, there is a greater likelihood that married men are sexually active, but the percentage of married women under the age of 35 is still decreasing.
Young people's views on premarital sex are divided, about 30 % consider it a bad thing, while about 70 % believe it is acceptable.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior is pushing this trend forward. "
For the majority of those who have moral problems with premarital sex, the reason is their religious upbringing.
Since 2008, the proportion of abstinence among people under 35 years of age who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 percent to nearly 60 percent.
Among the " less believers " the trend rose from 10 to 20 percent, according to Stone.
The decline in sexual activity is also influenced by other factors,, such as less social interaction and, in particular, alcohol consumption during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of having sex was lower among people without jobs or with lower incomes.
An additional reason may be the expansion of digital media, which is likely to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, as a result of which this need is " substituted " by it.
This trend became popular during the lockdown during the pandemic of the coronavirus.
The whole issue of compulsory vaccination against the AIDs is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave in a way that they do not want,, but which may save their lives.
It is a relatively difficult question, one that is of most interest to him personally, the question of social responsibility.
For example, the question of whether, if they are not forbidden and they die, it is their fault.
His argument is that the 80- year old man, who did not know much about it, had been misinformed, had heard some misinformation, and as a result did not want to be vaccinated and eventually caught the disease and died.
On the other side, he does not believe that the death of the stubborn opponent of vaccinations, who stood side by side with the SPD and the KSČ, was an act of persecution and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics mentioned, it is possible to deduce that the vast majority of unvaccinated pensioners belong to the second group, which means that they are able to take care of themselves.
Czechia without snow.
As the mild winter gives way to the battle against drought.
The winter of 2012 so far has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent years in Croatia.
The operators of skiing areas are not able to operate without technical snow, and the weather complicates the preparation of the 100 km bicycle race in the Jizerka Mountains.
It is a trend, or an exception.
Lack of snow means little for the fight against drought in Czechia.
I have one story to tell,, but it is not about a man who beat his wife.
Once in the middle of the city, the teacher led them across the entire city to the river dock, so that they could sail on the river.
Along the way, they passed through a fairly wide street once and saw a group of followers of the Hare Krishna sect in the middle of the street..
Naturally, they were overwhelmed.
Fortunately, she managed to escape,, but with one of her friends she had a conversation..
When she left, they asked her and the teacher what she said.
They asked him if he wanted to save his soul.
He said to them that he had no soul,, and that he replied that he had no soul..
Everyone, including the teachers, were smiling all the way to the dock..
They are terribly spoiled.
It does not happen as much, but the system is crumbling, according to Orozović.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors.
"It opens a new chapter in the bilateral relations, " said Morawiecki at the joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
Caused by the unsettling movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, the Chancellor considers it necessary to resolve the situation through diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the " Normandy Group " comprising France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that the Chancellor informed him about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko deliberately created a migrant crisis and uses people as living targets and weapons, because every night there are hundreds of attempts to cross the border illegally.
With the Chancellor, he discussed further sanctions to force the Lukašenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin to realise that they are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz told the DPA that Warsaw enjoys German support in its dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukašenko regime.
The intoxicated Polish nun caused the accident and tried to conceal it.
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but it was driven by another nun,, who tried to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could lose her driver's license for not giving way and for fleeing the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, said TVN24 station.
She admitted that she collided with another nun, who asked her for help.
The police then came for Celestine's sister.
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and after discovering that she had more than two percent of alcohol in her blood, they immediately took away her driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would be interrogated in court.
Pes Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmović did not protect his film.
The Czech creators of family comedies were seen in American stories about pet lovers.
But they overlooked one of the most important aspects of filmmaking, the conventions of the film industry.
After the kitschy film F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people to live, another film is competing for the audience's emotions in cinemas.
Co--author of the screenplay and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr. freely continues on his previous film Tady hlidam ja from 2012.
The speaking fox Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the stage..
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumavian pension, which is going bankrupt, and so they hire a dog trainer, Julie's father with his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl but a young woman who is experiencing her first love..
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičov, who is also the producer of the film, struggled with the pace of the storytelling in the previous film, which at least appealed to children and dogs.
This time, the creative duo wrote a weaker script, which provokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
To summarize it.
Julie, a scientist, falls under the spell of the desire to have a child and, when the right " constellation " is achieved, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are precisely determined - on the roofs of cars or church towers ( inevitably during an ongoing excursion with a local guide, the retired colonel Mojmír, despite his long--standing training, is wounded by a bullet in the forest and his daughter ( Julie ) falls into a coma, after which the family is removed from the hospital to allow the miraculous process of healing to take place in the heart of the Šumavian wilderness.
There is no objection to the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of the animals' beloved ones.
Their owners know why they have them.
The audience, however, was stunned by the bizarre and improbable nature of the plot, its characters.
A pair of thieves from the staff, the competition of dog breeders, the shumavian sharlatan, the policemen arriving to find " drugs " and discussing about the strength of bone powder as a fertilizer - and the peeled- off family in the pension drinking alcohol.
When the hero comes out of a coma, he immediately sits at a cigarette- smoking, cigar- smoking, cigar - smoking, cigar – smoking, cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking cigar – smoking
The audience is still told by the creators that " sometimes after a coma, it becomes. "
Šajmović's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build up dramatic situations, a sense of character and a sense of point and direction.
The acting is uneven, the staging is sloppy and the overall impression is underwhelming.
Whatever Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudovo try to make their party survive, they do not have much to play.
The only legacy of the film is the poetic scenes of the Šumavian landscape filmed by cameraman Vladimír Holomka and the pair of foxes.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot, and vulgar expressions, which the characters indulge in.
The argument is not the fact that she has been a member of the club of foxhound breeders for a long time, as in the case of the producer.
For the purpose of propagating nature and friendship between man and dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft, so that the man can tell a believable story.
In this case, it did not succeed.
The good family film has a little too much erotica and a little too little sensitivity for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canisterapy, this amateurish piece would not have passed..
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from the same kind of people as themselves.
There is a difference between offering and coercing, which is shown by the fact that this hovno understands it,, but only because he has never tried it.
The decision is always in the hands of the customer, and if he does not want to, the answer is always no.
If he had listened to this for a long time,, he may have changed his opinion.
It is work like any other, in some cases a brigade.
The Balkans are experiencing unusually dry months.
The only time of the year when it rains is winter.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as observed at some stations, is unusual, the Israeli Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long--term rainfall average for November.
The two days of rain in this week were rather exceptional.
It is good for them.
It rained for a long time..
It is also the right Christmas backdrop for the residents of Nazareth, Wasím Aškar..
Rains in Israel occur almost exclusively in the winter months, are sporadic and irregular.
In the winter rains, the forests are dependent.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fire.
It is not only about forests, also about water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Galilee River, reached its maximum capacity in 2011 due to three consecutive rainy winters.
Since then, the water level has fallen.
The hydraulic engineers had warned of the drought for a long time.
"It is possible that rainfall will decrease due to global warming and climate change, " said in 2018 the head of the Israeli Ministry of Water Resources, Uri Schor.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination and recycling of waste water.
The situation is worse in economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan..
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman,, there is an increase in cistern vehicles.
Waters and private wells are drying up.
In September 2008, driver of the cistern vehicle Imad Sulejman said that the number of orders had increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years.
In the Iranian city of Isfahan, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The banks of the local rivers were completely without water.
The region has experienced the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military attack against Iran.
The Israeli Minister of Defense said that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring " any progress " and that he informed Washington of plans to attack Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran,, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, tried to persuade Americans to increase their pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about the military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring " any progress " and the world powers " understood that the Iranians were playing with them.
Around 3 years ago, this also happened to him.
She was a little annoying and she grilled him during the conversation to find out what she wanted from him.
In the end, he discovered that his suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because he really dislikes this kind of people, he was harassing her with doubts and questions for a while, and eventually apologized and left..
I can say that he is a robber, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
The skiers went to the mountains for the weekend and were met with plenty of snow and good weather.
The ski resorts in Czechia experienced the first major influx of skiing enthusiasts during this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some skiing areas started operations because of this.
The truckers were not deterred by the obligation to show their covid certificates..
On the other hand, crane operators do not complain about the lack of interest from passengers, while some of the skiing equipment rental companies report a lower demand for their services than before the epidemic..
Thousands of people took to the track and ski slopes in the region over the weekend..
The skiers were happy with the weather, which provided sunshine and good snow conditions.
They are satisfied with the opening weekend, which started with evening skiing on Friday, when the first skiers arrived on the mountain., said the director of the Sporting Area Ještěd, Jakub Hanuš..
Hundreds of people flocked to the first weekend of skiing in the new season in Jeseník..
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov and the centre in Branna in Šumperska were open.
The weekend attendance was very good and on Saturday and Sunday, an estimated 400 people attended.
The conditions are superb.
Today, the sun shone, the temperature was around minus three degrees, so it was perfect, the representative of the skiing centre in Branne, Rostislav Prochaszky praised.
The operators of ski areas can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are in the recovery period after contracting the disease.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared and have the necessary documents, he said to ČTK by René Hroneš from the Skicenter of Špindlerův Mlýn.
"They have recorded only a few incidents. "
Lower demand than before the pandemic is reported by some skiing equipment rental shops and stores.
Interest in borrowing skiing equipment is high..
It is not like in previous years,, but the number of customers is still high,, said Alexandra Bokișov from the Skiopava sales office in Oradea..
There is a larger influx of people during the skiing course period..
Also, the director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, David Šintak, feels that the lack of interest in renting skiing equipment due to the flu is not as great as before.
At that time before the pandemic, they were already almost exhausted.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, they are at about 50 percent, according to ČTK's Šintak.
According to him, people during the pandemic became lazy and learned to stay at home.
On the other hand, there is a great demand for the rental of vehicles in the Novako area of Bošim Daru..
They started renting skiing equipment a week ago and people have to order them ahead of time now.
" Bicycles begin to be rented this weekend, but people called ahead of time, so there is expected to be great demand, just like last year. " said the manager of the area, Pavlina Novakovic.
The interest is comparable to the period before the epidemic,, she says, also about the skiing school.
In order for successful and wealthy people to stay in the country, they must be able to live a quality life as in the country.
This does not include the socialist health system, where it is not always possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
The most intelligent and skilled people leave the country. they have no property in the country.
The owner of the company does not leave the country for a long time..
and the rest of it is absolutely true.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if they do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will not live in the Czech Republic..
The emigration from Romania began with one beautiful day when Orbán won and ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that, from one day to the next, the Czech Republic could find itself in a similar position.
The other issues are in general elections.
When a fool lives there, it is also possible for a traditional Slavic madman to win..
The young and the educated leave, the supporters and those whose property is loaded onto the aircraft remain..
A terrifying photo.
Langmajer in the blood for the sake of a beer.
While in Czech, the autumn was in full swing, in Thailand, the crew of the film Ostrov, headed by Jiří Langmayer (55) enjoyed tropical weather.
The actor posted photos of his bruised face on social media.
It's a real injury or a fake one for the sake of filming.
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
The last time she was seen was on the way home.
"The disappearance of Petry is not similar to her behaviour and the police are beginning to worry about her., " said Lucy O ' Connor of the Lambeth police station where Srncová worked on Saturday in a video.
" Her family in the Czech Republic is also worried about her and simply wants to know where she is. " continued.
The missing Czech, according to her, left work on Sunday 28th of November around 19:45 and headed home to the district of Camberwell.
The last time she was seen was apparently in an autobus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on 3 December..
According to British media, Srncová worked as an assistant nurse at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy 's and St. Thomas 's NHS Foundation.
"They have great fears about their dear colleague Petru, who is missing. " the group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
"They wanted to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help, to contact the police..
The public is also encouraged to work together by MP Harriet Harman, who on Saturday highlighted the case of Srncov during a press conference.
She has been missing for several days now, she is only 32 years old, her parents have died of starvation, she is from the Czech Republic, and in her hand she held a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I have the impression that all of them have a great responsibility to try to find her, because she was away from her home country, away from her family and was working there for the country's health care system. "
The police had already detained one man in connection with the case. he remains in custody.
According to the BBC's news website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what he was suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine,, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
It is not " an overwhelming number " but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
It is noticeable that Ukraine constantly repeats that the threat of invasion is exaggerated and begins to have reservations about the country's entry.
He was at the top.
He doesn't know how he came to the conclusion that Russia wants war.
War is sakra expensive and Russia has the HDP of Italy.
Compared to the situation in 1938, it is in so many respects different that it is hard to know where to start..
He can compare it to the First Punic War and the " annexation " of Sicily.
It was hard to imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not respect the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex these small republics.
This is the case and the " concentration " on the borders is the same.
Ono, the treaties are to be kept.
From Sunday, new schedules are in effect in Prague, affecting mainly suburban routes.
Passengers in the integrated public transport system of Prague (PID) will experience several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban routes.
New lines were created, some changed their routes and others were discontinued.
The Mladoboleslavsko district is now part of the integrated system..
In the main city, trains from Česki Budejovic stop in the Zahradni Město station from Sunday onwards..
In the suburban train service, S7 trains travel from Beroun to Český Brodu, passing through the main railway station in Prague.
In the recently opened station of Prague- Zahradni Město, the rychlík R17 from Českých Budějovic and Benešov will now stop.
PID is now expanding to other areas.
The buses also went as far as Světle nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Starých Splavs and Turnov.
Included are buses in the Mladoboleslavska region, including those with overlapping routes to the Liberecky and Královéhradecky regions.
During the integration, 77 lines were cancelled, 37 new ones were introduced and 12 existing ones were altered.
From the Zličina district of Prague, a new bus line 405 is launched, which goes all the way to Žatce.
Also, a new direct road connection was established between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovnia, which replaced the cancelled railway line S53.
In the morning peak and on weekends, flights from Prague to Rakovnia will be strengthened with the introduction of a new express line number 404.
The lines 400 and 410 operating in the Libereck region have been added to the PID system..
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
Line 400 travels through Mělník, Dubou and Českou Lípa to Nového Boru and selected flights continue to Rumburak or Cvikova.
Line 410 goes over Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimonne and Jablonné in Podještěd.
On the other hand, operation has been cancelled or reduced on a number of local railways in Central Bohemia, including to Mochova, Dobříše and Rožmitál pod Třemšin..
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railways, there are long--term restrictions on the tracks between Prague and Beroun, between Prague and Lysa nad Labem and in the area around Kolina.
Changes are also taking place for travellers at other locations..
The buses replace some of the discontinued railway lines or extend the section of line 420 from Dobrise with a connection to Prague, where PID tickets can be used as far as Milevska.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk were changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Horovo were altered in the Pilsen region.
A healthy lunch or dinner in the office from a supermarket.
Hours are 9 to 5 with a 30 minute lunch break, and the only place where he can get food is to go to the nearby Billy or Lidl.
Due to the fact that he has no movement, after work he has no strength to exercise, so he has to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, he never knows what he is going to buy, and in a hurry, he buys pizza, sandwiches, yoghurt and apples..
The question is what a healthy meal without the need for thermal processing would have been recommended to be bought in the supermarket.
Not everyone wait for a meter of snow as they do, unfortunately..
It's not about the trees that must be seen.
Under the snow, only the tip of a tree can hide.
If a tree is damaged, it may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I don't believe that this is the only reason for them to prohibit them from travelling outside the ski slopes,, but it is one of them.
Confession of Dary's relationship with Nedvěde
The Czech showbiz pond has nothing else than the exposure of the relationship between Dary Rolins and Pavla Nedvěda from Friday.
They have been together since the summer,, and the famous football player even broke up with her because of the singer.
Dara now sent a lengthy message to her fans, explained why she hid her love for him for half a year.
Dara is allowed to claim that there is no one in Czechia or Slovakia who is not aware of the fact that Dara has caught a bear, i.e. Nedvěda,. jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player.
But he took her away from him, not the other way around.
Three days are the focus of attention, and although they are popular with the public, they are not a source of joy.
It's here.
As for the two things that they both disliked, but knew that they would eventually happen,, the singer continues..
I don't know who is worse off.
Those who do not care about it at all, and it appears on them from cans,, or those whose lives have been scrutinized to the minutest detail..
As if someone wanted to hear an opinion on whether they fit together with their husband or their girlfriend, or that they were determined to know the list of their former partners and were aware of the list of their mistakes and failures.
This is a game of chase and pursuit, which is not to the liking of Dare.
The duo met in Italy, where Rolins was preparing for the launch of her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been vice president of football club Juventus for a long time..
The truth was revealed only now, because they waited for the end of Nedvěd's divorce.
With his wife Ivan, they have been separated for three years, they are not legally married but have been separated for three weeks.
Those who rejoice with them and wish them to succeed are to be thanked.
They are just people, they have families, children, pasts and dreams.
They are not perfect, but they both have their hearts in the right place.
I love his new husband as much as he loves her, and she stands by him in good times and bad. Rolins concluded..
Ahoy, the other commentators have already said most of the important things, only confirming that the dorms are great at the beginning of the first semester or second semester, when most of the students meet and become roommates, which is the best option because they know who they will live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised for a long time beforehand,, so there is not much to be found now, but it is still worthwhile to look at the offer..
Certainly, he avoids not only Cejlu,, but also the surrounding areas ( streets like Vranovska and Francouzska, it is not a good address ) and some parts of Židenic are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the quarter of Veveří is full of students, Královo pole and in that direction is good, except that it is close to most of the faculties of VUT..
However, he has never been a landlord,, but he is a native of Brno,, so he may be able to give advice about Brno as such, if he still has some missing information..
This is an example of completely " normal " thinking.
This is due to the fact that a number of doctors somewhere in Poland decided to go on strike, so it is perfectly normal that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
If they do what they want and pay for it themselves, or if they follow the state's rules and pay for it with state money.
It is not possible to allow a private actor to take control of a part of the school system only because he adds a few crowns to the state subsidy and is able to teach whatever he wants in the schools..
This statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days before wrote about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state.
It's the same for him as for those who oppose having a statue on the square..
By talking directly with the person who assigned the work to him.
During the cataloging and digitalization process, he had already experienced that ( and even long--term professionals ) would either misjudge it or write something in the form of XXX or XX ( according to convention ) and in the notes that it is unreadable.
It is true that in this case, it is quite legible,, so that it would be better not to recommend it.
Personally, I would have solved it in a note according to the program used.
If he wanted to be a proper and diligent student, he could look into some phonological databases and find the nearest.
However, because it looks as if it is based on some books, it is likely that the author or printer simply created his own personal mark, which fits with what is physically on the coin.
PS. It is not a coincidence but rather the Odrynian Empire ( kingdom ) rather than the Odrynian Kingdom.
PSS says that someone has already broken it down here.
Looking at this comment with Φīlh.
Politicians do not know what the " theme " of Romania's presidency will be.
This is much worse than the fact that they will have translators with them.
The idea that something was approved because no one understood a text is amusing.
All important documents are scrutinized word for word, and a basic knowledge of English is insufficient, this is the domain of lawyers.
In various institutions of the EU, hundreds of translators and interpreters work, English is preferred by politicians for informal contacts and the establishment of exceptional relationships.
In addition, with the English, it is quite interesting after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
He doesn't understand the hate on Cejl.
He has been working there for the third year and is completely happy.
He goes home from work at 10 p.m. and never has a problem.
To that is the ghetto can only be said by someone who has lived there for a long time..
Jo lives there with most of the Roma population of Brno, but the only thing they do is obstructing the pavement and parking where they are not supposed to.
In other words, if he was looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, he would have gone for it.
There are a lot of apartments there now, newly reconstructed or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78 years old without Dada and girlfriend Gelemov as the center of the plot.
With whom he spends the holidays.
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
He does not have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to burn.
Blesku's saxophonist said that he had seen Dada's wreath and that Lucie probably has one as well. He thus confirmed the words of Patrasova, who said that she often visits him.
She visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrade,, where Dada stayed alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he would be on Christmas Eve.
Recently, they met with Anička, Felix and the two grandchildren.
Video : Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová - Zase Spolu.
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová, Zase Spolu.
However, they continued to talk about something, so they didn't get a divorce.
I don't know where he is.
Gifts are bought on a regular basis and Dad and Lucia are likely to buy something, probably a perfume.
He is a gentleman, Felix added, who himself came to the premiere of the music video in the club Richman.
He is alone, but he does not feel alone.
He always finds someone with whom he likes to have fun,, according to Slavacheck,, who was glad that he met his wife Luďka Soboty Adrian and singer Kamila Nyvlt.
He made it clear.
And we are an island, so they can allow themselves to be without soldiers and weapons.
It is doubtful that anyone would defend them, as their location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot to not occupy it.
I don't understand why it would be a bad argument, it should be explained to him.
There is no other component that could be deployed in the hospitals in the crisis..
Policemen are scarce and cannot afford to do so, so only the firefighters and nowhere else have such a high percentage of healthily trained people at such a level.
That the army is capable of defending Ostrava goes against the previous governments, not the army,, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record low rainfall in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside is not just a factory for food, according to the journalist.
Czechia is experiencing the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the amount of water has decreased in mountainous and sub--mountainous areas, the amount of rainfall has also decreased in areas where there was no shortage of water.
The cause of the drought in a large part of central Europe is climate change.
The effects are amplified by the manner in which the land is cultivated.
On what to prepare for in relation to the drought.
and how nature can help in difficult times.
It's like that, he can only maintain his position on the ice with hockey, he knows how to play it and the tactics ( which he tried in the game of Franchise Hockey Manager ) is also overall haphazard.
If the team is called the "Russian Bears" or the " Chinese lambs " they lost by two goals, even though they did not have to win the game. This is different from when it is compared.
As the commentators of the Czech team, who point out what the referees notice or do not notice,, are all strange, but this is the case with all sports, UEFA and " Italian actors " or motorsport F1, WRC, atd.
Controversy is everywhere.
If it was the other way around, it would have been the same as always, and that is that Česko has lost more often than it has won against Russia., so it would have been a classic "they lost " vs " they won " match.
Coronavirus - The number of cases in Russia exceeded 10 million.
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
There are 5,766 persons hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are 1967 per 100,000 and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of cases in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases were recorded.
It is the lowest daily number since 13 October.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10 016 896.

The United Kingdom is facing " inevitable " large waves of infection caused by the Omikron, said Dr. Susan Hopkinsová, the chief medical adviser to the British Office of Health and Safety on Sunday in television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with the omikron strain are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their numbers to increase.
So far, no one has died from the omikron strain, but hospitalization occurs approximately 14 days after infection and death occurs approximately three weeks after infection.
The head of the British Labour Party, Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson probably violated the law by organizing a New Year's quiz in Downing Street in December 2010, when the lockdown was imposed and New Year's parties were banned.
One of Johnson's ministers defended that the quiz was held " virtually " over a computer.
However, it was attended by a group of Downing Street staff gathered around computers.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the post of prime minister is growing.
During December 2010, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties in defiance of the lockdown.
The British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government have made a mockery of them.
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV in Britain, said that two years ago, Boris Johnson won the general election with an overwhelming majority.
In the morning, the Conservative Party spoke of the need to remove him from the position of prime minister.
Noteworthy that the events developed rapidly.
They want to turn around and save their skin.
Romania is waiting for elections in the spring, which could end the 12- year reign of Victor Orban.
The elections are of great importance for the whole of Europe.
As time goes on, it becomes clear that they are good people.
They are not fair.
They are unlikely to be free, because they were not free in the two elections before Orbán.
His party, Fides, controls the media, changes the boundaries of election districts to benefit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
The current situation is that each person can choose where they want to live.
This allows Fidesu to move voters from certain districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could win.
In other words, there will be no ferries at all.
They think that it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018.
However, the situation is radically different.
Previously, it was about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now, there is a real possibility that the united opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
For Viktor Orbán and his party, this is an unprecedented phenomenon.
They are trying to maintain power by playing even more aggressively..
There are some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they had done before.
Recently, a recording of the president of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fideszu, Lászloa Kövera, was leaked to independent media, in which the chiefs of the secret services declare that the opposition poses a threat to national security.
These are the hints of a new approach that are discussed.
This is one of the new things.
Everything begins with language.
She was beaten quite often, the last time was when she was 14, her mother has little patience, she herself has little patience, and her father has been beating her for a long time,, but then he breaks out violently ( only in relation to her ). .
At the same time, she was very choleric and she was very angry as a child, to the extent that she lay on the ground in a frenzy and was all blue, twice she was taken under the sprinkler to calm down.
He was sometimes punished, sometimes he did not know what he was doing.
I's tendency now is to resolve things violently,, as a child, she was quite rebellious, and as a teenager, she used to hit things with her fist, and as a youngster, she used to hit her parents with her fist,, but she never did anything extreme,, but she always had a tendency to hit her parents with her fist.
She is not able to determine to what extent her explosiveness is due to her upbringing, but it certainly has a part in it.
He is afraid that he will also lose his patience with his children and have to deal with it in the same way.
He thinks that hitting children is bad and that his parents did not have to do it, especially at this time when it was not " educational " but out of frustration. On the other hand, almost every parent damages their children in some way, so he does not blame them.
It doesn't bother him and he does not understand why the OP should be ashamed.
The laws must be clear and unambiguous.
Kundami would therefore call those who create laws in such a quality.
It would be interesting to see whether they are afraid of a drop in income.
It is possible to count on the fact that people want and buy these products, that they will be able to pay for the debt.
Kocner's bizarre world.
When Slovakia moves the process of the murder of the journalist Kuciaka.
In Slovakia, the main trial in the case of the four accused of murdering Jana Kuciaka and Martina Kushnirov began..
The death of an investigative journalist and his partner changed Slovakia.
The civil society was shaken, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Mariana Kočner and his connection to the top of Slovakian politics and justice.
The process for Slovensko represents a major breakthrough.
For this, the journalists are responsible..
It is possible that this petition received more media attention than the counter- petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later.
It's a shame that they have been fooled and the society has turned its back on them.
In the Czech television, people died of the disease even before half a year..
The next government ends and the law on the involvement of villages in the selection of the disposal site is nowhere.
Minister Karla Havlíčka's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiše is nearing its end and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of villages and their citizens in the selection and approval of deep underground nuclear waste disposal sites still does not exist.
The legislative council of the government suspended the examination of the proposal presented by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce after years of pressure.
However, its content is in serious disagreement not only with the affected municipalities united in the Platform against underground nuclear waste facilities,, but also with the Association of Cities and Towns of Romania.
The local authorities expect a more significant strengthening of their ability to decide on the disposal of radioactive waste,, as promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which requires the implementation of the nuclear law and the European directive.
They expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposed law by Minister Karla Havlíčka, which the Platform has at its disposal, is criticized by the communes in particular. The proposed level of involvement of the communes and the public in the process of deciding on the location of the disposal facility is inadequate and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the communes and their citizens.
It can only be effective when the local authorities or the public can influence whether the process is continued in that locality.
It is possible to enforce the obligation of the Waste Disposal Authority to obtain the consent of the affected municipalities before the start of the specific proceeding..
The draft proposal is almost completely ignorant of public involvement and makes the citizens of the communes mere statistics in the permitting process.
In the draft, there is a lack of systematic compensation for villages for the entire process of searching for and choosing a site for the disposal facility, its approval and operation.
The representatives of the communes, according to today's legal norms, have little possibility to defend the interests of their citizens when they are looking for places for the disposal of radioactive waste.
Only in some licensing procedures, they can submit their objections or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or minister in whose interest the licence is issued.
A possible lawsuit does not have an immediate effect on the execution of surveying or construction work.
The Platform's proposal for a joint decision by the municipal council is a principle that is commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and is decided upon in those that have already progressed in the permitting of landfills,, such as in Sweden and Finland.
The preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the Havel and Partners lawyers' s.r.o. company, which was signed by SÚrao and followed by contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total sum for these works according to the contract is approximately 4 million krones.
Antonin Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson of the Platform against deep underground nuclear waste disposal said that after the ministers of the Ministry of Industry, who only rebuffed the position of the local authorities in the search for a deep underground nuclear waste disposal facility,, the new government is waiting for a more decisive turnaround.
They also offer assistance.
They also thanked the Union of Municipalities and Towns, which also considers the lack of rights for municipalities in relation to the construction of major buildings to be similar to those of the directly affected municipalities in the chosen locations.
The Platform against underground nuclear waste disposal unites 51 members ( 35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations ) for the purpose of promoting changes in the state's approach to the handling of decommissioned nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which is not limited to the underground nuclear waste disposal facility.
The Platform also advocates that the decision on the location of the disposal site was dependent on the prior approval of the affected communities.
Herce John Goodman (69) lost 90 kg..
Although his lifestyle has remained unchanged for a long time, eventually he was frightened by the doctors..
They told him that if he did not lose weight, he would die.
It took a long time.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, this is half of his original weight of 180 kilograms, reported the newspaper The Sun.
At the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles, he boasted of his new character.
From the sitcom Roseanne, he is a completely different person.
John joked that his friends and family urged him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture to break.
"All of it went into his mouth, " the actor said in an interview with AARP in 2018.

Moving, exercising.

It also depends on which boss and how the word " boss " is used.
If it is a text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment,, in general,, he would not translate it.
If it was a formal text or a high school text,, he would have looked for how the bosses would have described or explained it.
There are many different types of bosses..
For example, a game like Dark Souls has several bosses, that is, the " boss " is something like the lord or ruler of the level, and then there is a final boss.
In many games, there are hidden bosses ( super bosses ) that are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often stronger than standard bosses.
In games of this type, the bosses are there, but the player does not fight them directly ( Tentacle, Gargantua ) and they can be called in any way.
And then there are mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss in one word in any language. even Catalan, which translates the boss as the final enemy.
It is important for the story or the game as a whole that the computer- controlled opponent is stronger than all the previous ones and is guarding the completion of a certain level or task.
The world is searching for the missing Petre from London..
The Czech police also took part..
Since the disappearance of Petre Srncov, the British police have been searching for him since 3 December.
The Czech police also took part in the search..
The 32- year old woman from Uherskohradišťska has been missing since 7 December.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
Czech Petru Srncovou was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
The British police have been looking for her since 3 December.
Interpol issued a yellow notice.
After Petre, the whole world is looking for him.
The Czech police cooperate closely with the British police, confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"They shared information about the case. "
The search for Petre was already announced on the police's website..
He is 168 centimetres tall, is slim and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same colour.
It is believed to have come from Uherskohradišťska.
Pete worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
His friends and colleagues are worried about him, such a disappearance is unusual for him.
Harriet Harman, a member of the House of Commons, was also involved in the search for Petre..
She took part in the distribution of leaflets with the face of Petry.

In connection with the disappearance, the British police have detained one suspect.
However, it is not clear who it is and what he had in common with Petru.
Before Christmas, Czech terrorizes Agent Tesla.
On the other hand, data from October showed a slight decline in the number of attack campaigns, but the month prior to the end of the year saw an increase in the number of attacks.
On 18 November, there was a large campaign in connection with Agent Tesla.
The attacks are aimed at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for the time being.
The infected envelope in the e--mail has attracted the attention of the user because of the name, which refers to payments and financial transactions.
In contrast to the previous month, it had a dangerous appendix in the form of the word faktura, and this time it was designated as a copy of the receipt for 11,2021., said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The harmful code actively searches for stored registration codes and then transmits them to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in Czechia at the end of August and the beginning of September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers rose again.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case did not specifically target the Czech Republic and security specialists in November detected more of a global campaign.
Compared to the November data of the Formbook, in November, it decreased slightly, still standing for almost half of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th and 15th of November.
Formbook often contained an addendum with the name Request for Specification.
However, the name of the ticket is also used..
The addendum in Czech may be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
The security analysts of the Fareit program, which was responsible for 16 percent of the attacks and had no major campaigns in the last few months in the Czech Republic, noted a significant drop in activity.

The long--standing dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led to them finding common ground.
Only the antivaxers, antirouškaři and others were able to organize such a large procession and pay for it.
The rise in popularity of the actions of the association Chcípl pes is reminiscent of the Million Hours for Democracy upside down.

It is difficult to say what movement would come from this dissatisfaction, which depends not only on the influx of money, but also on whether the quadruple and more Pfizer vaccine becomes square.
This is not a left--wing or centrist movement. that is the case.
The trivalent vaccine is almost completely certain to become a quadrivalent vaccine because it is clear that it will have to be re-chocked every six months.
He is very happy that the vaccine saved him.

The end of the patu, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing change.
The Bulgarian president Rumen Radev entrusted the formation of new governments to the leader of the anti- corruption movement Pokraucheme in Change, who won the November elections.

The winning parties were unable to come to an agreement, so there were two more early elections.
