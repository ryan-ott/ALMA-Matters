Warning! Mixing Conda and module environments may lead to corruption of the
user environment. 
We do not recommend users mixing those two environments unless absolutely
necessary. Note that 
SURF does not provide any support for Conda environment.
For more information, please refer to our software policy page:

Remember that many packages have already been installed on the system and can
be loaded using 
the 'module load <package__name>' command. If you are uncertain if a package is
already available 
on the system, please use 'module avail' or 'module spider' to search for it.

It refers to an area where people go to swim, sunbathe, and play in the sand. The word comes from the French phrase \'bêche\', which means \'a place to sit\'. In Spanish, it is spelled with two letters - \'e\' and \'c\' - and is pronounced differently than its English counterpart.\n\nIn Spanish, you can also use the word \'plage\' to refer to a beach. Plage is derived from the Latin word \'placus\', meaning \'flat ground\'. This word is often used when referring to large public beaches that are open to the general public.
